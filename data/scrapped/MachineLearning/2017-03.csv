Essentially it's the same as a sparse GP but with a gradient descent algorithm as the optimization function. An example of an SVGP in the library is [here](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/classification.html).

I'm trying to use Adam (from tf's optimization functions) as the optimizer. [Here](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/svi_test.html) is an example of it being used for SVIGP regression in GPFlow. I'm running the model right now but the Adam optimization step is taking an incredibly long amount of time. I suspect this is because of the 'maxiters=np.inf' parameter in the optimization function. Is there an intuitive reason why this is used when using Adam as the optimizer? In all of the other examples in the docs it's a relatively small constant.

And I guess compared to max pooling, strides would work just as well and be cheaper (faster convolution layers), but a variant I see mentioned sometimes is that people sum both average pooling and max pooling, which doesn't seem easily covered by striding. When would you choose which downsampling technique?

Also, is there a pooling analog for transposed strided convolutions (upsampling)?",13,21,False,self,,,,,

My question is about the methodology when cross-validating the entire stacked ensemble to check generalization error.

To eliminate any confusion, I'm going to call the cross-validation to generate out of fold predictions for the base learner CV A, while I'll call the cross-validation of the entire stacking ensemble CV B.

When I do CV B, is it valid to do CV A *just once* and use those out of fold predictions for the **entire** CV B process? Or do I have to keep doing CV A and generate new out of fold predictions during each fold of CV B?

Normally, I'd think that there'd be some data leakage in the first method, but one could also reason out that since the out of fold predictions are taken, well, out of fold, that issue is taken care of. The main reason I'm asking this is because doing the second method would surely remove any data leakage but there would be an order of magnitude of additional computational complexity involved.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Fundamentally, it seems like an advantage that VAEs can compress data like MNIST/CIFAR in to fewer dimensions (like at this [demo](http://www.dpkingma.com/sgvb_mnist_demo/demo.html)). However when looking at the paper and the code for inverse autoregressive flows, it seems for something like CIFAR, the latent dimensionality is (height, width, n_z) where n_z is number of latents.

It seems to me that the n_z channel is a result of a convolutional operation (see [code](https://github.com/openai/iaf/blob/master/tf_train.py#L183)) and is not simply the same n_z numbers tiled across the dimension. But then this would seem to suggest that there are n_z * width * height non-identical parameters summarizing the data. If you check the size of the q_z means and std. devs when running the [code](https://github.com/openai/iaf/blob/master/tf_train.py#L38) they also have dimensionality of (height, width, n_z).

In the paper, they say for MNIST, ""a single layer of Gaussian stochastic units of dimension 32 is used"".  However the above seems to suggest that this results in a ""latent embedding"" of MNIST that is of size 28 * 28 * 32. This seems like an awful lot of latent variables to parameterize hand-written digits especially when 10 variables can capture so many axes of variation (in that demo I linked).

So is the latent dimensionality of IAF with MNIST really include &gt;25k parameters and the whole model is just trying to squeeze itself into something resembling the standard normal prior while being seemingly quite overparameterized per pixel, or am I really fundamentally misunderstanding the code?

If this is a misunderstanding, how would one extract the 32-dimensional embedding of a MNIST digit from the publicly available code? Thanks and sorry if this is a dumb misunderstanding.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

Supervised Learning is the same, but like ten or fifty times more.

I've read a little on [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_networks) (Generative adversarial networks) and they have a sort of obvious flaw to me: a bias towards the mode of a distribution. For example, say it is tasked with generating car colors, and let's say for example that 90% of cars are black while 10% are red. Then generating a red car (unless I'm misunderstanding it) would be penalized in the adversarial scheme.

Has this been addressed yet?

If not, I have a few solutions. If it is any good, what's the best way to get it ""out there"", so to speak? The solutions:

1) Simplest, least efficient. Instead of generating 1 sample, the generative network generates a batch of N samples simultaneously, and the adversarial discriminator evaluates this N sample batch. In the car case, we would expect to see, on average, 1 red car every 10, so that the generation is forced to learn the full statistics and not just sample near the mode (maximum likelihood);

2) More complicated, more efficient. The generator network works as usual but the discriminator network is given memory. This memory is used to keep track of the statistics of all the samples generated so far (perhaps with priority given to the most recent ones) -- so that in general the discriminator works as an 'anomaly detector'. The generator is trained to keep the anomaly low (so, for example, if it goes too long without generating a red car, eventually the anomaly will rise and it will be forced to increase the red probability, through backpropagation on the anomaly).

Knowing that the CSO of Geometric Intelligence is Zoubin Ghahramani of Cambridge ML Group, ""the most Bayesian ML group"" out there, a good guess would be it uses Bayesian techniques, variational inference, or some ideas from Gaussian processes.

Consider that you have an algorithm, and you are trying to optimize it's output by tuning it's hyperparameters with randomized hill climbing. However, one of the parameters practically makes the program run slower as you increase it. As such you need a ""sparser"" search space in this direction in order to run your optimization practically. However, all of your variables are dependent, so it may be the case that tuning needs to be done primarily in this high time cost area, and you want the optimization algorithm to figure that out via hill climbing normally, so you don't want to ""punish"" going into the high time cost area, you just want to vary sparcity by going into that area. Furthermore, consider this, what if you the researcher don't know what combination of variables have high time complexity or low, and you want the RHC optimization to take this into account automatically.

Can I get your feedback?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5y0c3a/dhave_an_idea_of_building_machine_learning_rigs/,Arrow222,1488893570,"Hi guys


I notice a serious lack of ML compute resources for universities in my country (Hong Kong) and the prices of Amazon P2 instances are really expensive. ($0.9 per hour for a K80 Tesla, 8.7Tflops single precision)


Hence I have an idea to setup cost effective ML rigs that can be rented out for less than half of Amazon's P2 instance price and am seeking your opinion for such services.


One probable reason for high cloud computing cost is their choice of equipment. [Enterprise grade Teslas](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814132041), their motherboards and supporting equipment offer poor price to performance.


From my understanding, ML doesn't require FP64 compute and ECC GPU memory, specific to Tesla GPUs. Hence by using workstation/consumer grade equipment, a much better price to performance ratio can be offered to renters.


4x K80 Tesla with 34.8Tflops of single precision compute costs $3.6/hour or $86.4/day if you were to use Amazon.


Would you consider renting

- A 1080Ti (10.6Tflops single precision) + Kaby Lake i3 and 32gb ram for $0.45/hour or $10.8/day?

- 4 x Gtx 1080Ti (42.4 Tflops single precision) + 6 core X99 system and 128gb ram for $1.5/hour or $36/day?

Do you have any specific needs that need to be addressed? (Internet speeds, storage?)

Open to any feedback and suggestions, thanks for reading!

Longer version:


I've been studying the field of machine learning for awhile now, and what struck me most about the field is that it's not nearly as hard as it seems to be, but a lot of the terminology is needlessly confusing.

I posted about this on devrant and a lot of people there encouraged me to make learn-blog. So, working with /u/thejohnhoffer we made it.

In each lesson, we address common misconceptions and decode confusingly termed topics into understandable concepts. 

We also provide examples of how to make neural networks using [keras](https://keras.io), assuming only a rudamentary understanding of Python.

In my first few attempts I got some pretty fantastic looking clusters and data segmentation using the raw output from my feature extraction (using [Music21s jSymbolic feature extractors](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/moduleReference/moduleFeaturesJSymbolic.html) for those that might be interested). All well and good.

I figured a good next step would be to do some feature-wise normalization of my dataset (scaling all values between 0.0 and 1.0) and see how t-SNE changes. The problem is that when I do this, and then visualize the normalized features with t-SNE, I see almost no structure in the data whatsoever. I've tried a few perplexity values now and running t-SNE on the normalized data produces almost no clusters and instead looks like noise. I've also run PCA on the normalized data and am seeing nothing but what looks to me like noise there as well.

Does t-SNE expect normalized data? If so does this mean that there is no inherent structure to my data (which is, for the most part unlabeled)? Why might the non-normalized data cluster so nicely?

Any and all thoughts on this are welcome, as I am looking to learn about t-SNE during through this experiment as well. I am happy to provide more details (data, images, etc...) if that would help.

I train the output layer with a one hot encoded vector that represents that last word in the ngram sequence. I trained the network using tri-grams (i.e. input two word predict the third word). After doing this I found the network almost always predicts the third word to be a ','. I'm guessing this is because commas are over represented in the corpus.

I'm doing some research on easily generated models by non-technical/statistical people. It would be awesome if some of you could answer a quick questionnaire:

If you're a machine learning developer/data scientist etc.:
a) Has your manager/product lead etc. ever insist that you build a model on a correlation you felt wasn't there?
b) Do you think if that people had a way to verify the lack of correlation through a naive model (random forest, svc, etc.) that it would have changed the situation? (Or, if you were able to show them the results)
c) Would you want this technology for yourself, or wish that your company would have access to it?

If you're a non-technical person (small business developer, student, non-tech entrepreneur, etc.):

a) Have you ever not pursued a potential machine learning/data solution or feature because you weren't willing to invest the resources to see if it was viable?
b) Would being able to verify correlations in your data (or lack thereof!) entice you to pursue possible machine learning solutions?
c) Even if your previous answers were no, would you be interested in having this technology?

* ~1 second or slightly less per inference step on CPU on a larger model (100M params) with 512d hidden size

* ~100ms per inference step on a small model (10M params) with 128d hidden size


Both models use 100K vocab. GPU decoding is certainly faster, but not orders of magnitude better.
Are these times reasonable? When I see TF Serving boasts +50K per second requests on some models, it makes me think there is something seriously flawed with my setup. How is it possible to get speeds that quick at inference?

I am not using TF Serving or their threaded data queuing mechanism, but I have tried freezing (convert variables to constants) and exporting the graph, as well as loading multiple models in parallel. Nothing has provided a substantial improvement. I am hopeful that upgrading to TF 1.0.0 and using XLA will improve the performance.

As the title suggest, I'm working on a project where I am trying to train a machine to detect if an audio segment is just one single song, or if it's actually two song playing simultaneously. 

Right now, I am using the technique that reddit user u/bennane suggested in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5livzv/projectquestion_what_is_a_common_set_of_features/dbwg543/) (more details here http://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/ismir2013/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/69_Paper.pdf).

For additional information: I use 10 second segments for each sample, down sampled to about 4400hz, and then cut into pieces of a couple second long each. Each piece is then described using the technique I mentioned above.

I have very limited experience in the field, and right now I'm using the feature extraction method from the paper (single scale instead of multiscale), but I am not using it to train a neural network. Instead, I've done some experiment using a linear SVM, a random forest classifier and a gradient boosted classifier. I've had acceptable results so far (getting about 0.80-0.85 global AUC in my experiments with a 30 000 sample dataset). This is mostly because those seemed to be easier to use, and I wanted to make the project as simple as possible to start with and gradually add complexity as I get more experience in the field. 

* Now, my first question is: Is there any major advantage on using a neural network over a simpler linear SVM or gradient boosted classifier for my kind of problem? I understand that training a 1 layer neural network can easily be paralyzed which speeds up the process significantly when dealing with a large number of samples, but is this the only advantage? 

* Second question, given that the training data is labeled for a classifier (2 classes: 1 song vs multiple song), is there a technique that can be used to somehow train a logistic repressor instead? As in, the training values are either 0 or 1, but when doing a prediction, the machine will actually return a score between 0 and 1 (a decimal value) which represent its position between the two. For example, if I put a sample that is actually 2 songs (but sound almost like 1 single song), the machine would return a value that is close to 1, but not exactly (maybe 0.8 or something). I tried using the ""probability"" value returned when using the prediction function on the machine (which, from my understanding, return a confidence score for each class), but I'm not sure it makes sense to use those values that way. I also tried playing with the decision function (in the case of a linear SVM, the distance from the hyperplane), but again, even though doing so makes sense in my head, it might be completely wrong to do this.

* Third question: right now, all my segments are exactly the same duration. What if I want to use different  size segments? Is it fine to simply pad the feature vector with zeros for the time slices that are missing?


Thank you very much!

I've managed to get a fairly robust system. However, I'm having problems with targets that are even slightly out of scale or if there's features that are very dominant. 

For my project, I'm developing a perimeter detection/classification system to identify drones in a restricted area while ignoring other objects such as birds. This is solely a simulated projects so I can control all the parameters to improve performance. However, I would prefer not to to preserve the authenticity of the project. Currently, I have completed the detection algorithm and am sending a zoomed in shot of where the target is with the same parameters as my dictionary. The dictionary was created via taking shots at 15 units away. The only processing done to the dictionary is to take a highpass filter of the images. I would consider using other machine learning techniques, however we only have 14 weeks to complete this project and CBPDN is the only algorithm I am familiar with. Plus I'd like to meet people who work with algorithms that aren't neural nets.

If you were coding this what classifications would you use to build the AI to flag said activity on the web? How would you feed the input into the AI for it to distinguish non pedo vs pedo or non trafficker vs trafficker. I realize this is a bit of a deep project because we are now profiling and having the AI judge based of a framework of a pedophile or human trafficker by personality traits

Of course the obvious result would be that the network would learn to ignore the input and only output 1, but maybe a carefully constructed architecture could force the network to learn something about the input distribution.

For a very simple example, lets say the input was just the mnist digit 0 and the discriminator is just one fully connected layer to the output, with no bias. If [cosine normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05870.pdf) was used, then I think that the learned weights would resemble an averaged 0, because the cosine distance would only be 1 if the input and the weights are simmilar. To extend this to all 10 mnist digits, the dense layer might have 10 outputs which are reduced to 1 output by max. I wonder if a deep convolutional network using only max pooling and cosine similarity layers could be trained to convergence, and then a generator network could learn to fool it afterwards.

I tried this in tensorflow but couldn't get the discriminator to converge as the weights would immediately blow up. Here is my code if anyone sees something wrong:

    def cosine_simmilarity_convolution(x, W, shape):
        mask = tf.ones(shape)
        input_magnitude = tf.sqrt(tf.expand_dims(tf.reduce_sum(tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d(tf.square(x), mask, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME'),3),-1))
        weight_magnitude = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(W), [0,1,2]))
        conv = tf.nn.conv2d(x, W, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
        return tf.nn.relu(conv/(.0001+input_magnitude * weight_magnitude))

The A3C Algorithm (and N-Step Q Learning) updates the globaly shared network once every N timesteps. N is usually pretty small, 5 or 20 as far as I remember. 

Wouldn't it be possible to set N to infinity, meaning that the networks are only trained at the end of an episode?
I do not argue that it is necessarily better - tough, for me it sounds like it could be - but at least it should not be a lot worse, right?

The lacking asynchronous training based on the asynchronous exploration of the enviroment by multiple agents in different enviroments, and therefore the stabilization of the training procedure without replay memory, might be a problem if the training is done sequentially (as in: for each worker thread, train the network on the whole observed SAR-sequence). 
Tough, the training could still be done asynchronously with sub-sequences, it would only make training with stateful LSTMs a little bit more complicated.

The reason why I am asking is the ""Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning"" paper.
To compare it to algorithms like A3C, it would make more sense - from a code engineering point of view - to train both algorithms in the same episodic way. 

TL;DR: Is it feasibly to train an A3C algorithm in an episodic context?

618,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2017-3-19,2017,3,19,2,605du0,self.MachineLearning,[D] A few experiments about gradients in Deep Learning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/605du0/d_a_few_experiments_about_gradients_in_deep/,Kiuhnm,1489859563,"In the past few months I experimented a lot with ""gradient manipulation"" in MLPs. My efforts didn't amount to much, unfortunately. I'd like to know if anyone else has tried anything similar.

My first idea was to analyze the gradients of single samples/examples. In regular DL, the final gradient is the mean of the gradients of the single examples of the minibatch. I noticed that if one drops the more extreme gradients and perform a truncated mean instead of a normal mean, one gets a nice regularization effect at least in 2D, but it doesn't scale to multidimensional spaces. Would using clustering instead of a truncated mean make a difference?

My idea was that the net is like the world and the samples are people who make requests (gradients) to change the world. During learning, most people adapt to the world, whereas some (outliers) do not. This is why ignoring extreme requests reduce overfit at least in low dimensional spaces. I didn't try clustering because it requires too much computing power.

Another idea was to stop updating a single weight where the gradients became to unbalanced, i.e. when the mean was too far from the median. Combined with the truncated mean it worked quite well in 2D, meaning that many outliers were ignored and overfit was vastly reduced.

Here's another idea: compute the gradients wrt to 2 (or more) minibatches and then compute the elementwise maximum and use it as the final gradient.

If the samples are all positive (like in MNIST) then, by favoring positive gradients, we favor negative weights which, because of relus, promote activation sparsity. A more principled way to do this is to take the activations into account and choose the maximum or minimum (elementwise) of the two gradients.

For instance, if the first neuron activates for too many samples, then we select maximum gradients for it so that the activation rate drops. If the rate is too low, we increase it by selecting the minimum gradients.

This is a little bit of Theano code to make things clearer:

    def custom_gradient(self, inputs, out_grads):
        X, W, b = inputs
        G = out_grads[0]

        # --- normal gradient ---
        # return [G.dot(W.T),
        #         X.T.dot(G),
        #         G.sum(axis=0)]

        # self._output is XW+b.
        W_grad = get_grad(X, G, self._layer_id, self._output)
        b_grad = get_grad(None, G, self._layer_id, self._output)
        return [G.dot(W.T), W_grad, b_grad]

    def get_grad(X, G, layer_id, A):
        num_blocks = 2
        target_density = target_densities[layer_id]
        G = G.reshape((num_blocks, -1, G.shape[1]))
        if X:       # for W
            X = X.reshape((num_blocks, -1, X.shape[1]))
            g1 = X[0].T.dot(G[0])
            g2 = X[1].T.dot(G[1])
            mu_min = T.minimum(g1, g2)
            mu_max = T.maximum(g1, g2)
        else:       # for b
            gs = G.sum(axis=1)
            mu_min = gs.min(axis=0)
            mu_max = gs.max(axis=0)

        zero = T.constant(0, dtype=floatX)
        acts = (A &gt; zero).astype(floatX).mean(axis=0)
        d = acts &gt; target_density

        return d * mu_max + (1 - d) * mu_min

I tried this with the first 1000 samples of the MNIST dataset. With the normal gradient I get an accuracy of ~89.5, whereas with the custom gradient I get 92+. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work well with the whole dataset of 50000 samples.

edit: BTW, if instead of promoting sparsity we promote density by flipping the rule (i.e. by switching mu_max with mu_min in the code above), we get 85 or worse. So, I think it's really sparsity which makes the difference. Of course I printed sparsity statistics during training to make sure that the algorithm was really working.

##edit2

Maybe it isn't clear from the code but we can compute gradients of single examples of the batch just in one pass of backprop.

For instance, the gradient wrt W is X.T.dot(G), which is

    prod = X.T.dimshuffle(0, 'x', 1) * G.dimshuffle('x', 1, 0)
    G_W = prod.sum(axis=-1)

where prod[i,j,k] is the gradient wrt to W_ij for the k-th sample of the minibatch. This works because each block during backprop receives the gradients wrt the single outputs, if you think about it.

My intuition told me that this had to be the case and tests confirmed it.

That's why in my code I can do

    X = X.reshape((num_blocks, -1, X.shape[1]))
    g1 = X[0].T.dot(G[0])
    g2 = X[1].T.dot(G[1])
    mu_min = T.minimum(g1, g2)
    mu_max = T.maximum(g1, g2)

So, it's not less efficient because we can use bigger minibatches!

As a second point, notice that we can control the activity of every single neuron. Activations (before relu) are computed as

    A = XW + b

so the activations of the i-th neuron through the minibatch is X W_i, where W_i is the i-th column of W_i. We can increase the activity of that neuron by increasing W_i (and b_i).",9,25,False,self,,,,,

For 2D images, we apply 2D convnets. For voxel data, we apply 3D convnet. We also have RNNs share weights in temporal domain.

Now then, assume the structure of the data is *unknown*, all we have is a high dimensional vector. It's probably a multi channel image, a spectrogram, or some program running trace. But assuming the data have inherent structures that can reduce parameter count, can we build a model that:

* 1) Can learn the structure of the data.

* 2) Can exploit the learned structure to reduce parameter count.

* 3) Can also reduce computational cost as more structure is learned.

Extra: represent the ""structure"" in a continuous way, so that the parameters won't be ""violently"" removed. SGD would be happier with this, 1) and 2) can also proceed at the same time during training.

I gave this some thought however failed to come up with anything elegant, yet.

1) Seems simple, applying something like t-SNE to the correlation matrix would yield some ""structure"".

2) Is rather tricky. IMHO convolution theorem could be useful. Since conv(x, y) == IFT( FT(x) * FT(y) ), all that needed is to learn the fourier basis for the unknown underlying ""structure"", then the weights can be shared in an implicit manner. However I didn't have time think deeper or implement it. It may have some problems.

I have no idea about 3).

First post on this subreddit! I was hoping to incite some discussion on technical aspects pertaining to my undergraduate thesis. In short, my project involves building and training a classification model to categorise recyclable items into 4 labels; plastics, glass, paper, and general waste (if it doesn't fall into the former 3 categories)

The current sensor data streams that I have access to is a camera (image recognition), microphone (acoustic analysis), load cells (basically a scale for a weight reading), and a metal detector (detects changing frequencies with nearby inductive metals). I am planning to extract features from these data streams and convert them into Tensors to run through a TensorFlow computational graph which will be structured as a deep or convolutional neural network.  

My questions for discussion are: 
1.) What feature extraction/preprocessing should I perform on the four data streams to create the best dataset?
2.) Approximately how many samples will I need in my dataset to train a reasonably accurate neural network (say above 95% prediction accuracy)?

Thanks in advance!",3,1,False,self,,,,,

A total of 400k products need to be translated from the old (less refined) to the new product category tree. (E.g. alarm clock used to fall under 'Electronics' and will now belong to 'Alarm clocks'.) So far 36k products have already been partly allocated to ~400 (out of 800) new product categories. The filling rate ranges from 1% to 95%.   

Product data (among others) contains variables: name, description, price, dimensions, color and the old label . The idea was to construct features out of the unstructured variables through tokenisation -&gt; TF-IDF. 

Proposed Approach:

 1. Train one multi-label prediction model (e.g. Ridge classification + cross-validation + stratified CV) on the labeled data. Then predict the category only for subset that, based on the old product tree, contains all possible products. (e.g. predict if unlabelled 'Electronics' products are 'Alarm clocks')
 2. Based on the predicted probability present the unlabelled product to a content manager that, if labelled, would result in the highest information gain.
 3. Propose to which extend the remaining 400 categories should be filled (e.g. 60%) and which products to label first.

Part of the answer here from my reading is that inputs are all scaled to prevent bias on one input vs the other and have the weights determine which has a high affect on the output. Is there any theory for scaling to the unit range? I understand normalization is done to make the data as linearly separable as possible and similarly re-scaled on output to get meaningful numbers to the problem.



**2) Why does a ReLU -&gt; [0,x) work better vs a sigmoid [-1, 1]? How does this effect negative weights and inputs?**



My intuition here is simplicity by reducing range of freedom in the activation layer and increasing range in the weights, it simplifies back prop as the derivate of ReLU is 1 vs increased complexity for sigmoid.

This would also simplify training of the weight by reducing the target range for the activation layer. 

    i.e.  if my input x * weights (bias omitted) =&gt; activation

for sigmoid the valid activations are:

    (- input) * (- weight)  = (+)
    (- input) * (+ weight) = (-)
    (+ input) * (- weight) = (-) 
    (+ input) * (+ weight) = (+)
 

for ReLU the valid activations are:

    (- input) * (- weight)  = (+)
    (+ input) * (+ weight) = (+)

Plus training gets simpler as you add layers as you are only dealing with hidden inputs 0 to positive numbers. There are other complexities like vanishing gradient on sigmoid and ReLU blow ups, but thats fairly well covered in recent material.


Putting this all together:

**3a) Say you have real world inputs ranging from -100 to 100 and you normalize, is it better to go [-1, 1] or [0, 1]?**

Aside from experimentally determining it is there any theory?

**3b) Same question as 3a but now you have multiple signals that are different, like -100 to 100, 0-10 (fixed range) and -inf to inf, 0 to inf (inf range)?**

**Requirements:**

* In order to make use of these machine learning APIs, you do not need to know anything technical about machine learning, you should just know the basics of Python.

* A Google Cloud account. If you're signing up for the first time, you will get $300 in credits. To follow along, you will use no more than maybe a dollar if you use the shared CPU option (more than enough since we're not doing any real processing on our end), so you should have lots of credits left over.

**The covered topics:**

1. [Launching a virtual machine](https://pythonprogramming.net/virtual-machine-google-cloud-tutorial/)...which we'll be using for the rest of the series to use the APIs.

2. [Setting up API requirements, and intro to Vision API](https://pythonprogramming.net/vision-api-intro-google-cloud-tutorial/)

3. [More on the Vision API](https://pythonprogramming.net/vision-api-intro-google-cloud-tutorial/)

I have a data set with many categorical variables, so I want to use a library which natively handles categorical variables without one-hot encoding (which is especially important for algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting).  
  
h2o offers this nicely, and the training time of the algorithms have been faster than scikit-learn in my experience so far. However, I am a little turned off by their documentation, which seems slightly weak in comparison to scikit-learn (for instance the default values of parameters are not shown).  

Can someone with more experience share their thoughts about h2o? Is it a reliable library that I can safely put most my effort into?",5,3,False,self,,,,,

How useful it is in practice is debatable, since it is often sufficient to model the input noise as output noise, which is taken into account by other implementations, such as scikit-learn's.

Call for application for Machine Learning Camp Jeju 2017

If you have studied machine learning/deep learning and TensorFlow, you probably want to implement a non-trivial and large-scale system for real use. We invite you to the month-long Machine Learning Camp Jeju 2017, where you can make that dream a reality.

For a full month in beautiful Jeju Island, you and other participants will train a deep learning model using TensorFlow from start-to-finish. Jeff Dean (Google Senior Fellow via Hangout), and Rajat Monga (Google/TensorFlow Director (TBC)) will give us keynote talks. Plus, you will have access to experienced mentors including Namju Kim (Head of Research for Kakao Brain), Lucy Park (TF-KR), Sung Kim (TF-KR), Donghyun Kwak (TF-KR), Terry Taewoong Um (TF-KR), and many more. We hope you take advantage of this wonderful opportunity.

Those selected as participants will be provided with one (1) round-trip airfare (up to 300 USD) to Jeju Island (South Korea), room and board at Jeju National University, USD 1,000 in stipends and USD 500 to 1,000 in Google Cloud Credit. In addition to these benefits, participants will gain valuable and practical experience in the field of deep learning. We look forward to your application!

Mentor Recruitment: If youre interested in sharing your experiences and expertise with the camp, please contact us at mljejucamp@googlegroups.com. You will serve as personal mentors to 1 to 2 participants, holding 2 to 3 on/offline meetings a week to help them successfully complete their projects. While it is possible for you to provide online-only mentoring, we suggest you visit Jeju Island to meet with your mentees in person. We will provide round-trip airfare (up to USD 300) to Jeju Island and up to five (5) days of room and board.

(Information regarding schedule, program and benefits are subject to change as we are in the process of finalizing the details. We will have more information later.)

You're an imaginary interviewer. Ask away!

### **I'm having a dj vu. Didn't you already post this stuff yesterday?**

Yes, but I realized I did a bad job at explaining and introducing my idea.

### **Why sharing an idea instead of trying it out first and seeing if it works?**

I don't get paid to do research in ML, nor to do ML. Actually, I don't get paid to do anything at all.

This means that everything I do is purely for fun, and now I don't feel like boring myself to death implementing this thing in Theano. I prefer to watch [Silver's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) about RL.

Also, I don't have the resources to conduct proper tests.

### **Why should anyone do your homework for you?**

I prefer to think of it as the draft of a project that anyone can contribute to.

In the near future I might implement this thing and do some tests.

### **Why parallelize BackProp?**

For efficiency reasons, mainly. In classic BP only one layer can do any computation at any time because:

1. it needs data from the previous layer in the forward pass
2. it needs data from the next layer in the backward pass

### **But isn't BP inherently sequential?**

Yes, but maybe we can relax it to make it amenable to parallelization.

### **What kind of relaxation are we talking about?**

We delay the updates to the net.

### **Can you give a real life example?**

Imagine you learn by taking exams and reviewing the grades and corrections provided by your teacher.

In classic BP you:

1. take exam E1
2. receive corrections for exam E1
3. take exam E2
4. receive corrections for exam E2
5. ...

In Relaxed BP (RBP) you:

1. take exam E1
2. take exam E2
3. take exam E3
4. receive corrections for E1
5. take exam E4
6. receive corrections for E2
7. take exam E5
8. receive corrections for E3
9. ...

### **How much faster would it be?**

Theoretically, it should be N times faster, where N is the number of layers in the net.

### **So all nodes/layers do computations at the same time?**

Exactly. Each node does a step of forward pass and a step of backward pass.

### **Can we use classic libraries such as Theano?**

Yes:

1. Each layer/node has its own shared variables.

At each step of training:

2. A new sample/example is fed to the first node from the left.
3. All samples move to the right by one node.
4. When a sample moves to the right it gets transformed by the node it goes through (**Forward pass**).
5. New gradient information is fed to the last node from the right.
6. Each piece of gradient information moves to the left and gets transformed by the node it goes through (**Backward pass**).

### **If it takes time for a single sample to go through a net which is continuously updated, how can the sample see a consistent net?**

The weights of the layers are not of the same age (age = number of updates).

Have a look at this picture:

     X-&gt;
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1
        
1. X is the sample which enters the net from the left.
2. Wi are the weights.
3. If Wi is below Lj then it belongs to layer j.
4. The i in Wi is the age of W.
5. The initial net has weights W1.
6. When a weight Wi is updated it becomes W(i+1).

At each time step, X goes one step to the right and each weight is updated:

     X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1

           X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W6    W5    W4    W3    W2

                 X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W7    W6    W5    W4    W3

                       X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W8    W7    W6    W5    W4

                             X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

X goes always through layers of age 5 and, therefore, sees a consistent net of age 5.

### **What about the other samples?**

No problem:

     X5    X4    X3    X2    X1
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1

     X6    X5    X4    X3    X2
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W6    W5    W4    W3    W2

     X7    X6    X5    X4    X3
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W7    W6    W5    W4    W3

     X8    X7    X6    X5    X4
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W8    W7    W6    W5    W4

     X9    X8    X7    X6    X5
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

In this case, sample i sees only a net of age i.

### **But how can older weights be on the left if the updates in the backward pass start from the right?**

The updates are delayed until they reach the first node:

        --------&gt;--------&gt;----------+
                                    |
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5  |
        ^                           v
        |                           |
        +-------&lt;--------&lt;----------+
        
### **And what about the labels? Wouldn't samples and labels get mixed up?**

Not if things are properly synchronized:

     X9    X8    X7    X6    X5     &lt;-- Y5  Y6  Y7  Y8  Y9 ... 
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

As you can see, Xi always ""meet"" Yi and, thus, we can compute the right gradient starting from the right node.
        
### **How can we propagate the error back if the net got updated in the meantime?**

We need to memorize some of the previous nets.

### **How many?**

Basically, if the net has N layers, we need to memorize 2N - 1 copies of weights (+ some additional information) to the layers.

### **But then the computing time will go up by 2N times!?**

No, each operation is still O(1). We keep a queue of 2N - 1 elements, but we only access 2 elements per node at each time, just like in the classic BP.

### **I'm not convinced. Could you show me a picture?**

Here you go:

    X5    X4    X3    X2    X1    &lt;-- Y1   Y2   Y3 ...
       L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
       W1    W2    W3    W4   (W5)
       W2    W3    W4    W5    W6
       W3    W4    W5   (W6)   W7
       W4    W5    W6    W7    W8
       W5    W6   (W7)   W8    W9
       W6    W7    W8    W9    W10
       W7   (W8)   W9    W10   W11
       W8    W9    W10   W11   W12
      (W9)   W10   W11   W12   W13

We have 5 layers and each layer maintains 2*5 - 1 = 9 elements.

The Wi in parentheses are currently active and determine the age of the corresponding layer.

So, in the forward pass:

1. X5 sees W9
2. X4 sees W8
3. X3 sees W7
4. X2 sees W6
5. X1 sees W5

The Wi are not just weights.

To be precise:

1. all the Wi *above* the Wi between parentheses must also contain the input to the layer, whereas
2. all the Wi *below* must contain the gradient of the loss wrt the output.

### **This sort of makes sense, but how do we do the updates in parallel?**

Let's have another look at the picture above:

    X5    X4    X3    X2    X1    &lt;-- Y1   Y2   Y3 ...
       L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
       W1    W2    W3    W4   (W5)
       W2    W3    W4    W5    W6
       W3    W4    W5   (W6)   W7
       W4    W5    W6    W7    W8
       W5    W6   (W7)   W8    W9
       W6    W7    W8    W9    W10
       W7   (W8)   W9    W10   W11
       W8    W9    W10   W11   W12
      (W9)   W10   W11   W12   W13

This is the hard part to understand:

1. X1 and Y1 ""meet"" and L5 can compute gradient information relative to (X1, Y1).
2. L5 is currently at age 5 (because W5 is in parentheses).
3. L5 computes its own W14 from X1, Y1 and its own W5.
4. In general, Wi is always used to compute W(i+2N-1), where N is the number of layers.
5. More specifically, Wi is always used to compute W(i+9) in this example.

6. W13 of L5 has been computed, at the previous step, from W4 (which was then dropped).
8. W4 of L4 belongs to an old net (the current net is of age 6 from the point of view of L4).
9. W4 of L4 can and must also remember its old input.
10. L4 computes its own W13 by using W13 from L5 (for gradient info) and its own W4 (for input and weights).

11. The same way, L3 computes its own W12 from its own W3 and W12 of L4.
12. And so on... 

Here's the picture after 1 step:
      
    X6    X5    X4    X3    X2    &lt;-- Y2   Y3   Y4 ...
       L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
       W1    W2    W3    W4    W5   &lt;-- now we can drop this row
       W2    W3    W4    W5   (W6)
       W3    W4    W5    W6    W7
       W4    W5    W6   (W7)   W8

### **Are you sure this will actually work?**

I'm 90% sure.

### **How can we boostrap this... *thing*?**

We should be able to use zeros and repeated weights (or something like that):

As we can see, the diagonal is always older on the left and gets younger going right, as intended.

### **Are you sure you don't want to implement this?**

Maybe in the future if no one beats me to it.

Even if it works algorithmically, it remains to be seen if the delay hurts convergence or generalization.

### **It was nice talking with you!**

Yes, but I did all the work.

### **Will we meet again?**

Only on paper, I hope.

Currently, I find pixel RL of particular interest to me, and to get a feel for the current state of the art, I figured I'd start by doing my own implementations of DQN, a3c, NEC, etc.

This is where the training time becomes really discouraging. Getting an indication that the DQN algorithm is working, even for the simplest game in the atari domain, will take half a day. At the moment, I'm just reimplementing existing results, I cannot imagine trying to work out something new.

In any case, how do you do your prototyping? Are there some lower difficulty level pixel learning applications out there? Where some indication of successful results can be seen after some 5-10 minutes of training on a single machine with gpu? And where a successful approach is likely to carry over to the atari domain?

If there are none, how on earth do you deal with such huge delays in your workflow?",11,8,False,self,,,,,

The idea was taken from here: https://github.com/jshap70/TensorFlow-Signal-Processing

We are not able to make the convolution network converge and are not sure where the problem might be. The error is currently at 1.3e8 and the ouput audio sounds really bad. 

Currently we don't take the FFT since the NN on github was able to distinguish between two different sounds without the need for FFT. 

Any ideas on how to improve this? Adding another layer?

Were continuing to develop a Coursera MOOC about practical Bayesian methods. We came up with a prototype schedule and wanted to discuss it with the community -- what do you think of the contents and order, what is missing etc.

See the detailed plan here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AHLKVQntgcRYhoNPL09NerAscbpzPneHrJWAH-B5yRs/edit?usp=sharing

This course is going to be a part of the Advanced Machine Learning specialization and will take 6 weeks. The short version of the schedule:

1) Intro, Statistics review, example models, Conjugate distributions 

2) EM (Latent variable models), GMM, probabilistic PCA 

3) MCMC 

4) Variational inference, LDA 

5) Stochastic variational inference, VAE, Bayesian Neural Networks 

6) Gaussian processes, Hyperparameter optimization, summary 

One of the homework we are not sure about is the paper reading assignment. Since one of the course goals is to train listeners well enough so that they can read papers about Bayesian models, we may make a homework along the lines read one of these papers, summarize it, and get the feedback from peer-review.

Another important decision is the final project. One of the ideas is to build a self-driving car by training a CNN to map image from a camera (simulated in a game) to the signals for the wheel. This part is simple and non-probabilistic :)
The probabilistic part is to combine signals from different sources that work in different conditions (e.g. usual camera works poorly at night, infrared camera works poorly when raining), and to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction, so the car can pass the controls to the human driver if it is not sure what to do.

What do you guys think? We are especially concerned about the homework (see details in the GDoc).

The setup in the image below is just for testing. Ideally I want to have a mini webcam on the bookshelf against the wall to analyze the images in 10 second intervals. I didn't have a webcam so I'm using my iphone as a wireless camera. Then I wrote a script to pull that video feed into a png and process it into the model. The prediction is POST'ed to a server endpoint on my network.

One of these ideas is 3D object generation and I thought it might be useful to post to brain dump for myself, but also for others who are curious about this topic as well.   
  
So how would you create a neural network / machine learning project for generating a 3D model from 2D images? Does anyone know of any projects doing this with machine learning (that aren't listed below)?   
  
##Some Ideas on Strategy:  
----  
  
**Analyzing Images**  
My first thought to is to use something similar to scanning the way written number detection with [the MNIST examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) works to scan an image in order to extract features. However I'd also add a feature to provide camera positions if you had multiple images.   
  
**Generating 3D Models**  
Then, and this is the part I'm still working to visualize more clearly, is how you would then generate the 3d model. My guess is to use [Wavefront objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) which are easy to generate text-wise. I'm just not seeing how you would check it is all.   
  
**Using a GAN**  
Perhaps use a [GAN](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN) to identify a verified 3d model versus the generated one and render them and compare which render looks better?  
  
**Training**  
Also, would you need to have an database of 1,000+ 3d models to work from? Another option that could be doable is scripting a program to generate models. [Blender 3D](https://docs.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_67_release/) has a fairly easy to use python api which can generate via command line and tied in. There are also a [large amount of objects](http://www.blendswap.com/blends) available online. 
  
Once the simple mechanics (get the NN generating some 3D objects) are working, I'd like to tie in some more clever methods from research papers with better algorithms:

Using tensorflow and this dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand, I've been experimenting whether I can build a network to correctly classify poker hands.

My network can achieve an accuracy of 99.27% on the testing set (1,000,000 rows) but it has the following problems 

1. It's very good at recognising the 'simpler' hands (Nothing, One Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind) 
2. It gets mixed, to really bad results on hands like Straight, Flush, Royal flush etc 

It is setup as follows

85 (input) -&gt; 85 (hidden - ReLu activation) -&gt; 85 (hidden - ReLu activation) -&gt; 10 (softmax)  

I've been looking at some research on people using the same dataset to do the same thing, and most seem to conclude that the training data of 25,000 rows is heavily biased towards the simpler hands (for example the ""Four of a Kind"" examples only have 6 instances, whereas one pair has 10,599 instances) 

Does anyone know of anything I can do to get this network to do any better? Or is this a really hard problem, considering the high value hands are rarer and can easily be confused for something else. ",23,22,False,self,,,,,

Following my reading of this paper: https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/publications/icpr2016.pdf about Image matching, I wondered if such technics could work with different data.

In the paper, the classes they want to match are pretty wide: pictures of towns, of certain buildings, etc... Would such a network, using an Euclidean distance function as well, be able to match images with much less similarities? 

Let's say your dataset is based on fingerprints, and your different classes corresponds to as many users. As explained in the paper, pairs of fingerpints would be created (positive for fingerprints from the same user and finger, negative otherwise). [Example of fingerpint](http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fingerprint-reader.jpg) (note the actual fingerprints would contain additional noise)

Would CNNs be able to extract enough features in order to do any matching?

My problem is I have a dataset I've made of a few hundred 128x128 images (abstract paintings) - I'd like to simply generate more images similar to these images using a neural network (preferably no input needed for the network, except maybe random values?), but it's unclear as to how I'd go about this.

One solution I've thought about but haven't tried out yet is making an LSTM neural network, turning the paintings into 1D arrays of pixel values, and feeding the arrays to the network (LSTM networks are real good at learning sequences) - but if I'd want to work with larger images, this might not be very practical.

&gt; Theoretically, the above network structure can be trained with standard back-propagation [1], regardless of the input image size. But in practice the GPU implementations (such as  cuda-convnet [3] and Caffe [35]) are preferably  run on fixed input images.

In the paper, they train several networks with different, but fixed, input sizes and share weights amongst them. Further on in section 2.3, the authors explain this with:

&gt; The main purpose of our multi-size training is to simulate the varying input sizes while still leveraging the existing well-optimized fixed-size   implementations.

So my question is twofold:
 
 - The paper was written in 2014, does the claim still hold nowadays with the current versions of the frameworks? But more importantly:
 - Which part in the implementation of the convolutional neural networks is more efficient when having fixed size inputs on the GPU?",19,18,False,self,,,,,

I am trying to use WEKA for identification and classification of documents based on author using Naive Bayes. I have a dataset of stories written by sci-fi authors such as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Ray Bradbury .


&amp;nbsp;



I have converted these documents into arff file using the following scheme: 


*@relation Authors*


*@attribute textOfStory string*  
*@attribute authorOfStory {""Isaac"",""Philip"",""Ray""}*

(In training and test data - using two or more novels/short stories in each set for every author)


&amp;nbsp;


Afterwards, I converted the textOfStory to attributes using String to Word Vector (IDF transform + TF transform = true). This resulted in unigram word vectors with certain frequencies. For eg. the word attribute ""screen"" was given value of 0.44544, 0.44544, 0 for the three authors.


&amp;nbsp;



Can anyone help me understand how these frequencies are being calculated? As I have read word unigram frequencies should be helpful in identifying and attributing the author. Am I going on the right path, is this the right way to proceed through this problem? How can I compare both the data set using Naive Bayes in an interpretable manner? Any help is appreciated.

query ""intel i7""

So far the idea I have in mind is to just build a word vector of the search term say with an autoencoder and index the vector representations of each page and use some kind of similarity search, like https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss to do the actual matching.

The problem is the search vector is going to be tiny compared to what's stored in the database, so it seems like this approach will produce too much noise.

Let me know and I will move this somewhere else.

**tl;dr My school sucks for ML. I'm torn between gaining research experience in somewhat non-related fields, educating myself in ML through online sources like CS229 and current research, and keeping a high GPA.**

I'm just finishing my third year as a computer science undergrad at a university in Canada.

My school is quite lacking in terms of faculty who are actively doing research in machine learning (and AI in general). Even more so, there is only one undergraduate course related directly to AI, in which the machine learning component of this course consisted of the professor giving us a step-by-step set of instructions for implementing naive bayes without going into any of the theory surrounding it.  I've been denied entry time and time again into graduate machine learning courses despite having a high GPA and a clear interest / working-knowledge of the field.

Over the last year I've worked through Andrew Ng's coursera course, worked on a few small projects surrounding deep learning / neural networks, tried to keep up with current research (mostly via this subreddit), and I'm now currently working through CS229.

I want to pursue grad school after I graduate. While I had the opportunity to go to the University of Toronto, high-school me thought that following friends to this school was a better idea.

Its become very apparent that I'm stuck in an endless cycle of:

* Having to spend the majority of my time on non-related school work so I can keep a good GPA
* Which hinders gaining experience and educating myself in math/stats/machine-learning on my spare time
* Which further hinders seeking out various research opportunities.

What is more concerning is that I need to build relationships with professors at my school so I have some letters of recommendation down the road.  There are a few professors who work with undergrads in their research groups, but their research is orientated towards evolutionary algorithms and social networks.  

I know that any research experience is invaluable at this point.  Though at the same time, I think spending time on these would further hinder my ability to learn and work on projects related to machine-learning, which I feel I am very behind on compared to others coming from other schools that have better programs for this area.  

So the two issues I'm stuck between are that 1) I need research experience and valuable letters of recommendation from professors, but 2) I also need more education, since I'm going to be graduating in a little more than a year with what looks like zero formal education in machine learning.

This might not be worth adding, but I've kind of fallen into the cognitive science crowd at my school since they seem to be the closest thing to any AI I can get at my school.  For a class, I'm working on a cognitive model of zero-shot learning which involves some ML along with a cognitive architecture.  I'm not sure if this has any merit or if I'm wandering around lost at this point.

I greatly value any suggestions, similar experiences, and any help in general in terms of how I should or could approach my predicament.  I'm not in a rush to graduate.  If it comes to it, I might even consider moving to another school -- however I would lose 3-4 semesters worth of credits (time, and money) in the process.

The overall idea is as follows (whether it's a good idea or not isn't the point, it's more about the machine learning aspect and demonstrating my ability)

embed force sensors in prosthetic hand

feed data from force sensors to machine learning algorithm (micro controller or on a phone)

algorithm receives the readings and then categorises the activity as mode 1 (light work), 2 (medium level), or 3(intense)

mode defines how feedback to user is calculated - e.g. for mode 1 the user is only concerned with forces of say 100N to 1000N, so the feedback range is only between these two. The idea being it gives better resolution.

Another algorithm also implemented so that if a sensor stops working (and thus feeds back a 0) or is badly calibrated (so is way out of expected range compared to other sensors), error can be corrected.

So I have a two pronged problem - classification and regression I believe. I am attempting to compare three algorithms for the classification and just provide a solution for the error correction.

I'm thinking decision tree, SVM and (third?) for classification, and not sure on error correction yet. Any pointers/thoughts would be very much appreciated!

EDIT: report is 30 pages in length, and yes I will have access to data - I have the opportunity to use a force mapping glove next week and will gather data from 3 different activities for each mode. Other design goals include turning off the feedback if there is little change after a certain time - e.g. user doesn't want feedback if simply resting their hand on an armchair...",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I've recently developed a few new RNN architectures that seem to significantly beat GRU/LSTM on a few toy problems:

- (permuted or not) sequential mnist
- copy task
- addition task
- char-rnn

but I'm wondering if there are some larger, more 'real world' datasets available that would be natively suitable for RNNs?

Language models are not a perfect fit, because although they use the rnn framework, many different components come into play and the underlying RNN cell often is of minor importance.

Something with long term dependencies, some noise and possibly multidimensional, anyone? Sequential permuted ImageNet doesn't count ;-)

I'm not a newbie in machine learning, but i just started doing some RNNs and LSTMs analysis on time series data. The explanation of the LSTM parameters in Keras did not help me, and I spent couple of hours to search for a good explanation with example! on the internet, but i failed to find. So here is what is not clear to me.

 In the documentation(https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/)
There are three parameters: **input shape, input_dim, input_length**. 

1) Consider that I have multiple sensor data, for example I have 400 cases(say patients) that I have a time serie recording of each person for the length of 650 and the problem is binary classification of healthy and patient, what would be those **bold** variables in this context? 

2) About the input shape to the LSTM it is said in the link that:

*Input Shapes:
3D tensor with shape (batch_size, timesteps, input_dim), (Optional) 2D tensors with shape (batch_size, output_dim).*

If I use an LSTM with 100 units, what is the **timestep**? what is the **output_dim**?

3) is it possible to train an LSTM on multiple input rather than one time series at a time? So now each of 400 patients have 32 time series recording of the length 650 each, still the problem is binary classification of healthy and patient.

I hope others who are new to RNN/LSTM find this post since it is very confusing at first. ",9,5,False,self,,,,,

For those who haven't done PCR, in PCR you exponentially amplify your signal (one specific starting RNA) and measure the brightness of a dye that fluoresces when it binds RNA. You plot the brightness of this dye (~amount of RNA) against the number of cycles you have run (each cycle ~doubles your RNA) and the result is an S-shaped curve (exponential increase followed by your sample running out of material to make more RNA.) You take that point where the slope stops increasing (growth stops being exponential) and that's your measurement.

The problem is that every sample doesn't necessarily have every RNA that you're testing for. Some of them will never exponentially grow, and thus generate no value. So when you run PCR for many transcripts on a bunch of samples, as I did, you end up with a mix of categorical (value or no value) and logarithmic ( (0,40] cycles, for me) data.


So far my solution has been to replace ""No Value"" entries with the limit of quantification for that transcript/sample combination and run UPGMA clustering (using the euclidean distance similarity metric) on the resulting data. My defense of this is that I know that if the transcript exists, it's below my limit of quantification, and our method is accurate enough that the limit of quantification is very very small.

My problem is how sensitive the clustering algorithm is to small changes in the way I handle this ""No Value"" data.

Is there a better way to do this?

**Clarification**
I'm puzzled by the choice of keras to use the binarycrossentropy  function (l45) between x (the sample) and xdecodedmean (the output of the decoder network, sigmoid activation) to compute E_{z ~ Q(Z | X)} [log p(x|z)], or ""reconstruction loss"". It is related to the previous questions in the sense that I don't know how to derive log p(x|z) in this non-bernoulli / non-gaussian case.

Kingma and Welling detailed that the binarycrossentropy could be used (appendix  C.1; p11, eq 11) if the decoder was a bernoulli MLP. However, a data point  x lies in [0,1]^784 (784 being the dim of one image from mnist), and is not binary even though it takes discrete values.


Questions:

* **Q1**: How is the binarycrossentropy the appropriate (in terms of ""the one you get when deriving the variational lower bound"") reconstruction loss? 

* **Q2**: How important is the choice of the reconstruction loss in practice? By this I mean that you could rerun the code with the mse instead of the binarycrossentropy and find similar visual result, although I'm not sure how the mse between the sample and the reconstructed sample has any link with E_{z ~ Q(Z | X)} [log p(x|z)].
