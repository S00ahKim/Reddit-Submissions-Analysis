My first experiment is trying to use ANN with 2010 Public Use Medicaid line item billing data that is a list of ICD (diagnosis) codes and the corresponding CPT (treatment) codes that medical billers link to the ICD. They use this to justify payment from insurance companies (or in this case, Medicaid). There is only 1 diagnosis code per line linked to only 1 CPT code. 

What would be the optimal setup for a ANN to model this data? I want it so that I can feed the presence of an ICD code to the system and get an output of multiple CPT codes based on their probability of being relevant and assignable to the ICD code. For example, if the ICD code is for a broken leg, I want the algorithm to spit out say the top 10 most probable CPT codes (code for cast on leg, code for giving patient crutches, code for giving patient Hydrocodone etc.)

What is the best way to structure the ANN in terms of hidden layers, activation function, input dimensions and output dimensions? There are  approximately 13,000 different ICD codes and approximately 8,000 CPT codes. I was thinking, since there can be multiple ICD codes in one bill affecting the probability of which CPT codes are appropriate,  independence is not a good assumption and is the reason I'm avoiding using a Bayesian classifier.

So essentially I am trying to build an evaluation system that can test for patterns in a series of case studies. I have a 200 factor list that I would like to apply to approximately 50 case studies, 25 failures and 25 successes. More specifically I would like to see if one factor comes up more often in cases of failures vs cases of success. Here is a quick scorecard design

Two dependent variables: Success and Failure

Outcome A: Factor aids group A with Success

Outcome B: Factor aids group A with Failure

Factor// Present (0,1) // Outcome A (0,1,2) // Outcome B (0,1,2)

X   //      (1)         //       (0)          //     (2)

G  //       (0)        //        (0)         //      (0)

E //        (1)       //         (1)        //       (0)


The theory I am trying to test is simple. When factor X is present in a case it is x% more likely to fail or succeed.

I am lost on two points:

(1) Which stats method is best for analyzing this style of data?

(2) How do I weight categorical data as a number without generating confirmation bias?

Thanks in advance for your help, if anything is unclear let me know and I will do my best to clarify.

1. build vocabulary from data (300 images)
2. generate response histogram from vocabulary given descriptors of image N
3. Response histograms and class labels fed into training matrix
4. training matrix fed to SVM

With 300 images, I get 70% accuracy with the algorithm (Clusters 186) 
With ~500 images, it goes down to 52% (Clusters 186)

So, with the 300 images and 186 clusters, im at 70%. Then I can chance cluster amount to 180 and it'll go down to 50%. Or I can change it to 500 and it'll be at 66%

I'm working on a project for school where I intend to design and implement a classifier, which can identify the semantic relationship of synonomy using a machine learning algorithm. This will be my first major project in this area, so I'm trying to get as much input as possible on how I will approach the problem. As I see it, there are three major obstacles that must be dealt with:

1. Choosing an appropriate representation of English Syntax. 

Since finding semantic relationships must depend, at least somewhat, on complex syntactical relationships, I'd like to utilize a finite state machine to represent English grammar. That is, I'd like to represent each word with both its part of speech (as tagged by StanfordNLP's POS tagger) and its relationship to other words in the sentence, ie does it fall at the end of a noun phrase? 

Does anyone know of an easily accessible comprehensive list of syntactic structures for the English language, or better of a well developed finite state representation of these structures?

2. Development of a training set

I will be using a text of my choosing, identifying each word with a variable, its POS, and syntactic relation, and identifying all other synonymous variable.

3. Use a support vector machine to separate out synonymous concepts from the text based on POS and syntactic relationships.

I will do one concept class at a time, and I am hoping to find some sort of pattern that relates POS, syntactic structure, and semantic synonomy together. I'm choosing to use support vector machines because of the ability to use the kernal trick in order to look at many combinations of variables (words).

Obviously, this is just a simple outline of what I'm attempting to do, but I would really love some help and input from the community. My main background is in biology, physics, and neuroscience and just started in computer science in the last year, so I am somewhat lacking in experience. I have quite a bit of time before the project is due, but I would like to get started as soon as possible. Thanks!",7,4,False,self,,,,,

At the moment, I have created a neural network with all the back propagation and so forth. I am now looking at changing the variables such as the weights, learning rate, target and so forth. Are there any good articles out there that suggests what happens, when you change these factors or what they should be set to? 

For example I have set my weights to initialize with a random number between -5,5. Is that the correct thing to do?

I understand that the lower you set the learning rate the smaller the increments are each time it iterates, I am guessing I should weigh that up against how much time I want it to take and the complexity of the problem?

Also does the number of hidden layers, reflect on the complexity of the function/problem?

Cheers for the help, I think I just need to read them over and over. ha. Neural networks, definitely aren't easy.

I based my backpropagation on this example: http://galaxy.agh.edu.pl/~vlsi/AI/backp_t_en/backprop.html 
am I missing out the momentum? ( see at the end of the page, has pretty much the equation)


Heres a question,

Say if you had a inputs A B C = 0.9 , 0.4 , 0.1 and you trained your network to get an error of less than 0.001

and then you kept the weights the same but changed the inputs to 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, would get a higher error output? 

Basically, could you compare error outputs if you kept the same weights? so for example if a person gave A = 0.9 because he really liked it and we put in something thats 0.8, or 0.1 would it show low error difference for 0.8 and high error difference for 0.1 ?

I found FastMCD and DetMCD but these seem to be much more complicated algorithms with a lot of resampling. This is a performance critical part of the code so I think this is going to be a problem. 

So at the moment I am thinking to use the MAD extended to covariance through [this equation](http://i.imgur.com/2t9VQfs.png) from [Brown et al.](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=11727381366261974240&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5) which I think I can implement efficiently.

Also presumably with this approach my obtained covariance matrix will no longer be Wishart distributed so downstream considerations based on that might not apply?

I'm interested in the case where the power spectrum of my testing data may have the same general shape as my training data, but may change in amplitude or be shifted to the right or left along the power spectrum.  Does anyone have any ideas how I might accomplish this?  The only idea I can think of right now is to use support vector machines with a kernel that is shift-invariant, but even then I'm not exactly sure how to construct this kernel.  An alternate thought might be that I can simply construct features which are shift-invariant.  I say this last part because I once saw a paper that used cross-correlation in the frequency domain to achieve shift-invariance in the spatial domain, so it seems like I should be able to perform some reverse analog to achieve my goal.

I took Dr. Hinton's NNfML class a few months ago. One of the concepts that stuck with me was the idea that at present, the impression I was given is that people are making large neural networks to solve a single complex problem. The second impression I was given is that there is no 'good' way to do neural networks, there are only 'better' ways to set up neural networks. It's more of an art than a science (albeit with a healthy dose of either). 

So if someone writing a neural network needs to go on intuition and heuristics, what if the problem of writing neural networks is itself a problem suited to be solved by a neural network?

This brings me to my proposal. In order to use NN to generate NN, you would need building blocks. If there were a common interface standard for images, sound sequences, etc. such that smaller NNs could be written and stored in a common database, it would be possible to algorithmically generate a number of 'utility' neural networks. From this, you could use these to generate larger NNs. This provides a few benefits - 

1. You know what each part of the neural network does, so it might provide an ability to 'track' the information flow
2. You don't need to re-train the utility NNs, just the interface layers between each of the utility NNs and the output. 
3. If this repository of utility NNs implements the standard, the community could submit various implementations of a particular utility NN and the user would select the one with the highest success ratio. This ensures that on average, the quality of the repository increases over time. 
4. This strategy does not preclude enormous utility NNs as is the current standard - you would just make use of one of these in place of several smaller utility networks. 
5. Since each utility NN in the repository would be small, it might be possible to generate them algorithmically - for example, by scraping the web or media. 
6. Finally, with a consistent enough set of building blocks, it might be possible to train a NN in the procedures by which a NN is written, and feed it back into itself. A NN algorithm using utility NNs to generate new utility NNs, etc. 

Has this idea been done? Would there be any interest in a potential media for this kind of interaction?

Also forgive me if I have not made something particularly clear. It's hard to articulate neural-networkception.

My problem involves a gridworld and the agent is trying to make his way to a certain square. 

The robot only knows what actions he has taken and whether he bumps into a wall or not. If he does bump into a wall, he doesn't know what direction the wall is in, only that he has bumped into a wall.

From what I have read the QMDP algorithm only considers uncertainty in the first step and never again. Onto the questions:

~~1. Is the first-step the step it takes after it is initialized or the beliefs at the time it's initialized (uniform)?~~

~~2. If it only takes into account the initialized beliefs would it be right to say that the the sensory capabilities of the robot are irrelevant? (Since the initial beliefs are uniform)~~

**1. I am completely lost with respect to the QMDP formula found at http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch16.pdf . You calculate Q(x_i,u) for every action and for one specific state (since there is no for loop),and then in the final line it asks you to sum over all states x_i but you've only worked out Q(x_i,u) for one specific state previously! I am completely confused by this.**

Relevant links that may or may not help:

http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch16.pdf - QMDP algorithm is near the top

http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch14.pdf - MDP discrete value iteration is near the bottom too
