While preparing for a talk I will give soon,  I recently started digging into two major (Free) tools for interactive data visualization: [GGobi][1] and [mondrian][2] - both offer a great range of capabilities (even if they're a bit buggy).

I wish to ask for your help in articulating (both to myself, and for my future audience) **When is it helpful to use interactive plots? Either for data exploration (for ourselves) and data presentation (for a ""client"")?**

For when explaining the data to a client, I can see the value of animation for:

- Using ""identify/linking/brushing"" for seeing which data point in the graph is what.
- Presenting a sensitivity analysis of the data (e.g: ""if we remove this point, here is what we will get)
- Showing the effect of different groups in the data (e.g: ""let's look at our graphs for males and now for the females"")
- Showing the effect of time (or age, or in general, offering another dimension to the presentation)

For when exploring the data ourselves, I can see the value of identify/linking/brushing when exploring an outlier in a dataset we are working on.

But other then these two examples, I am not sure what other practical use these techniques offer.  Especially for our own data exploration!

It could be argued that the interactive part is good for exploring (For example) a different behavior of different groups/clusters in the data.  But when (in practice) I approached such situation, what I tended to do was to run the relevant statistical procedures (and post-hoc tests) - and what I found to be significant I would then plot with colors clearly dividing the data to the relevant groups.  From what I've seen, this is a safer approach then ""wondering around"" the data (which could easily lead to data dredging (were the scope of the multiple comparison needed for correction is not even clear).

I'd be very happy to read your experience/thoughts on this matter.

(this question can be a wiki - although it is not subjective and a well thought-out answer will gladly win my ""answer"" mark :) )

In the past ten years they have come up over and over in the computational biology literature, but I keep hearing that they are more over-fitted than useful. 


I am asking because I am wondering if using bayesian networks is worth it in my situation:

I have 2000 samples each with a 1000 discrete features that I want to use to predict 1 continuous variable. The hope is that I could build up a bayesian network that would characterize a small portion of my 1000 features as important and to identify logic gates between the important features. 

I thought about doing this as an alternative to doing regressions, because the dimensionality of the models limits me to testing interactions of two features at a time and prohibits me from finding higher order interactions. 

What I am not sure of is: 

(1) do people currently learn the networks using MCMC or GA or is there something better?

(2) what are the usual criticisms of Bayes Nets?

(3) I think I should test the significance of the bayes net using the likelihood ratio test with the naive bayes as the null hypothesis, but should this be done for different parts of the network or only for the whole thing?

thanks in advance for any feedback.

**edit: **

**thanks for the feedback everyone, especially the backwards moose, esoom! **

**I have some more things to mull over and will likely be back after I have tried several of the things that were suggested.

I am attempting to do a ML project which will let me try a number of different strategies in an effort to learn more on the subject.  I do not plan to have great results, but rather just use this as a learning process.  For now I am using Weka to analyze my data.

My dataset consists of NBA basketball information as follows:

Road Team, Home Team, Vegas Game Total Line, Vegas 1st Half Total Line, Home and away team 1st and 2nd quarter scores.  I am then trying to predict or guess what the second half total line should be (I have data on this to train with).

As far as sports goes, this is a pretty simplified project / dataset so I don't expect too great of results.  I was thinking of trying a neural net first, but do you recommend trying any other machine learning methods?  

I will update this thread as I go to let you know what I try and what kind of results I get!  Hopefully at the end it will be a nice little guide for those trying to start using Weka for the first time.",10,8,False,self,,,,,
