1,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2018-3-1,2018,3,1,10,811cmr,self.MachineLearning,[D] How to confidently show that one method is better than another at solving a particular problem?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/811cmr/d_how_to_confidently_show_that_one_method_is/,lalaland11256,1519866227,"I'm currently working on a project where I am trying to show that my method is ""better"" than some baseline methods. The main issue with this is that there is a lot of randomness involved when training and testing a model. For example, there is randomness in the initialization, there is randomness in the items selected as the training set, and there is randomness in the items selected as the test set. It seems like if you don't control for this (and simply report one number for one run), you could easily just be reporting noise.  I want to know that if I (or someone else) tries to reproduce my work, then they will get effect sizes similar to what I report.

What's the best approach for dealing with these sources of randomness? Is there a standard experimental setup to show (within a certain confidence) that one method is better than another?

Most of the papers I have read seem to either A) ignore this issue and simply report the accuracy on one particular test set from one particular run or B) bootstrap (or use other equivalent techniques) over the test set to deal with the randomness inherent in the selection of the test set.  Neither of the above two approaches really seem to deal with the randomness in the training set or randomness in the initialization.

My current main idea is to bootstrap over everything. Take random training sets, take random seeds, take random test sets, and then measure the average accuracy on those random training sets, test sets, and random seeds. However, this is incredibly cost intensive as it would involve training potentially 100s of models (depending of course on how stochastic your models are and how small of an effect you are trying to measure).",20,6,False,self,,,,,

I may be interpreting the algorithm incorrectly (it is somewhat ambiguous at times). Assuming I am correct, however, I wonder if this is indeed a problem? The algorithm defines a set of entry points for each level, so might it be the case that connectivity is not necessary?

I know conference ~~abstracts~~ papers are the most common form of research communication for neural networks, but are there any widely read journals as well? The ones I know of have low impact factors, which is not a problem in itself (at least to me), but may indicate that nobody reads them.

This happens with ResNets, DenseNets and even a vanilla VGG without batch-norm. I haven't experienced this while using data augmentation or decaying learning rates. The image above is the training log of a VGG on CIFAR10, with 0.005 learning rate (SGD+Nesterov) and 0.0005 weight decay. The frequency of these ""cycles"" seem to be very dependent on the learning rate and weight decay, and they only happen at 100% training accuracy.

Also, I'm using the imagenet example from pytorch's repo (except I'm training on CIFAR instead). I have tried removing most of the code almost to the point of only having forward / zero_grad / backward / step, and this still happens. Tried other training scripts / repos, no luck. I'm guessing this is not a bug / pytorch-related issue, and probably a general issue on network optimization?

Has anyone observed this before? This is a huge obstacle for a current project that I have, which involves collecting a lot of statistics regarding generalization and regularization to model network dynamics.",19,1,False,self,,,,,

Then lock the test split in a safe place. Do whatever you want with the train and dev splits (e.g., training on the train split using gradient descent, picking the hyper-parameters on the dev split, ...). Only after you satisfy with your model's performance on the dev set, you finally evaluate your model on the test set.

Now suppose you are a researcher working on Question Answering (e.g, SQuAD, MCTest, WikiQA, ...), and one day you come up with a new idea of a new model for QA. You train and fine-tune your model on the train and dev splits. Finally after months of hard work, you decide to test your beautiful model on the test split. And it gave very bad result. What do you do next?

+ Quit working on this and don't care about this forever.

+ Decide to find a way to improve this original idea / Decide to try a new idea. And then repeat the above process. But then if you follow this approach, didn't you rely on the test set to give you the signal that the original idea did not work well in this case? In some sense, you peeked at the test set to know which approaches work and which don't.

I started thinking about this when I realized that for few experiments I unconsciously printed out both the scores on the dev split and the test split. This broke THE rule mentioned above. But then when I read some paper about a model that has dozen of components, I would imagine that if the researchers follow the rule, then they first spend a lot of time implementing all the components. After that, they tested the model on the test set. If the result is good, then they write papers. If not then ???

As far as I'm aware, the general consensus is that knowledge should be more or less stored as a graph of triples (i.e. RDF). This seems way behind the other areas in ML which have moved from this kind of rules-based system towards DNNs with great success. Correct me if I'm wrong but at the end of the day, the structure of the knowledge graph isn't its weak point - gathering sufficient data is. Some people have sidestepped this problem by using DNNs to create graph embeddings, but your processing ability is reduced to vector space operations, and the quality of the embedding itself comes into question.

In trying to find a more robust solution I've looked into predicate/modal logic, which seems like it would act as a good basis. This idea is not new, in fact it is [quite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics) [old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic) as far as computer science goes, but the idea floating in my head is to have these logical models constructed on-the-fly by a DNN of some sort. This DNN would create logical propositions, compare the propositions to existing knowledge, and update its knowledge base accordingly. The end goal is to have a system that can model any world it can interact with, the key point being that ""world"" and ""interact"" are abstract concepts.

My main question: could I have a DNN that generates embeddings that correspond to model syntax instead of raw knowledge, and if so, how would I train such a thing? GANs or is there some better model? Any insight / links to relevant work would be much appreciated.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

I know that for Random Forest, for classification, you can have an idea by averaging the fraction of the majority class in the different leafs of the different trees. Having an idea of the distribution of those confidence scores could also give interesting information. 

So my questions are : 

* 1/ How about regression in random forests (regression forests), can you do kind of the same ? 

* 2/ How about both (classification and regression) in gradient boosting models. Do you just introduce the weights of the different tree classifiers ?

For calculating these metrics, do you find the average of these results per image to obtain overall results. For example, if you had 20 images in your test set, would you find the average of these metrics per image in order to obtain overall results? This seems like how it would be done, similar to evaluation in a multi-label context, so that images with more or less of a particular class won't bias the results. Also, I guess it would look weird, but I guess the entries in the confusion matrix would be fractions, potentially. It also seems, for the AUC curve, you would have to find the average TPR per FPR per image. Can you potentially cite some sources for this? I have been looking online and have been unable to verify this.

Also, if you mind me asking, what are segmentation metrics that are generally relevant to an informed audience. I know it also depends on the specific problem you are working on. I am working on a blood vessel segmentation problem. Thanks.",13,5,False,self,,,,,

On that video titled ""Learn Machine Learning in 3 months"", Siraj describes a 3 month curriculum to help you go from beginner to well-versed in machine learning. 

The curriculum is made of a combination of free courses from MIT, EdX, Coursera, Fast.AI, and Siraj's own tutorials and Github ML projects.

Well, as it turns out even with the curriculum laid out like that, the hardest thing is to actually stick to it and follow through all the classes and projects. Especially, if like most online learners, you are on your own, with zero accountability, no determined schedule, no deadlines, and no peer support.

So I went ahead and converted Siraj's entire 3-month curriculum into an [autonomous online free bootcamp on Mench](https://mench.co/LearnMachineLearningIn3Months) and posted it in Siraj's Youtube to see if people liked the idea of having some accountability. So far 24 students have signed up and the bootcamp will start next Monday.

Mench is simply a FB Messenger bot that guides you through the completion of any given learning curriculum.

This is how it works:

1. Every Monday morning you get a reminder to get started on that week's tasks
2. If you haven't done any work and it's getting to the end of the week, Mench will send you a reminder to get stuff done

The main goal is to help you actually stick to the plan all the way through!

I have a two part question:
1. Do you think the curriculum Siraj proposes can be done in only 3 months?
2. Do you think there is value on a tool like Mench that guides students to complete a learning program?

We just launched and any feedback would be welcome. Also, I'm new to Reddit so please forgive me if the format or content of this discussion is not appropriate for this platform.

Thanks in advance!",12,1,False,self,,,,,

This Forbes article proposes an interesting perspective, suggesting the future of ML looks more like how business jntelligence evolved: rather than everyone learning how to do the heavy lifting, the industry has really consolidated around a few tools that make the work much easier. Now you have companies hiring Tableau experts for $60k instead of hiring data visualization experts for $200k.

Im wondering if theres anything that might shake up ML in the same way. Some ML platform-like tools that could lower the barrier to entry. If so I want to align my career with that industry because if feasible it seems like the logical conclusion.

Id think maybe something like TensorFlow is the start of this, trying to make it easier. If we keep building tools and abstractions it seems like we may eventually get a Tableau-like tool for building ML algorithms / neural nets / etc.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

1) Read the celebA attributes

       #Skip header

           image_label = map(int, image_label)
           image_label = [0 if label == -1 else 1 for label in image_label]

           self.celeba_labels.append(image_label)



2) Use them as sample labels (like mnist)

    sample_labels = self.celeba_labels[0:self.sample_num]



3) Use them as batch labels (like mnist)

    batch_labels = self.celeba_labels[idx*config.batch_size: (idx+1)*config.batch_size]

The system will be quite powerful and multi CPU+GPU so sharing resources is not a problem.

Whats the best way to do it?

- XenServer (Standard?) has passthrough etc but Im not sure if I can use the same machine as a workstation...or only a classic remote Xen environment is possible.

- Linux setup with passthrough and a Windows VM?

It has three hyperparameters; sigmaF, sigmaN and L. The form is:

K = sigmaF^2 * exp(-2/(L^2 ) * (x1-x2)^2 ) + sigmaN * IsDiagonal

I'm sure you've seen this before.

In the past I've used an optimisation with cross validation to find good hyperparameters. However I think I have a simpler way.

My understanding is that GPR is representing the data points as being drawn from a multivariate gaussian with a mean of zero and  a covariance matrix.

Consider the diagonal of the covariance matrix. And, let's assume that we already know what sigmaN is through either resampling or a tacit understanding of the problem. Then, I'd like to put forward that we can estimate the sigmaF parameter by simply examining the scale of the training set. Let's say that most of these y values are about 10. This means that when we look at an element on the diagonal of the covariance matrix, then the x1-x2 will be zero, the exp will be 1 and hence the covariance of about 100 will simply be sigmaF^2 * 1. Hence sigmaF is 10. In other words, sigmaF is usually about the sqrt of the average of the squares of the training set Y values.

This leaves us only one parameter to estimate L. I don't see an easy way to guess this but at least my approach has turned a three dimensional problem into a 1 dimensional problem. I've replicated this in Excel and it seems sound.

So, what do you think about estimating the sigmaF hyperparameter as the sqrt(sum(trainingY^2 ))?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

A key aspect seems to be the sending of ""masked features"" to a central server / peers to further the learning process, which in this paper I take to be gradients. 

The way this paper proposes to defend against poisoning attacks is to identify ""indicative features"" out of this set of masked features that have a different distribution in an attack setting, thus letting nodes reject / deal appropriately with features that display an anomalous distribution.

I have two questions:
1. I've seen in other papers that deal with some kind of distributed ML this notion of sending gradients across the network - would these be the gradients on all the weights in the network, or just a certain layer's gradients? I'm unclear as to why gradients might be communicated as opposed to the whole set of weights + biases for a given node's local model. Why do so many papers focus on the transmission of gradients?

2. In section 5 of this paper, the authors write that one of the primary tasks of the system is to identify indicative features from the set of masked features. It seems they use KMeans to do this, but if the masked features are simply a set of gradients, can a set of gradients be meaningfully separated into ""indicative features"" as the authors say? I'm not really clear on how vectors of numbers can even be grouped together to say that this group has a certain distribution. Wouldn't that require knowing what the training data was that produced the gradient update?

Any clarity or insight at all on any of this would be greatly appreciated. Even just understanding why it is that gradients are often the chosen thing to communicate (and which gradients specifically) would be helpful.",0,5,False,self,,,,,

Did my master thesis on reinforcement learning for real-time applications. Also did a bit of work with machine vision(obstacle avoidance with UAVs). Now I've got a code monkey job, but I don't want my academic/research skills to go to waste, so I want to do a project for myself.

So basically I want to do an image recognition/classification algorithm with a flair for recognizing a 3d scene from 2d images. I know a bit about current state of art in doing object recognition with stuff like neural nets, based on feeding it a bunch of images and then matching patterns. Skimmed over a few papers, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's something I want to do. 

I'm looking for something more analytical, in a sense that an object isn't just matched by running an image pattern through a black box, but a shape is reconstructed from features with as little prior input as possible. So perhaps start with reconstructing something like a flat plane or a cube or a ball from an image and then moving on from there.

Is anyone else busy with something like this? What's the current state of art? And which papers/books should I look into to get started?",15,63,False,self,,,,,

Price is close to $3k. 

Q1: Are there any reasons you would think this is NOT a good system for a beginner who hopes to use is for 3+ years, possibly adding a second GPU at a later time?

Q2: I plan on ordering it without an OS and installing Ubuntu myself. Is it reasonable to expect this process to go smoothly, or is a Windows/Ubuntu dual boot setup better?

I wonder if it would be also possible to train an Auto Encoder to be able to encode the images into a latent representation first. Instead of feeding the Siamese Network two images, you could them feed them the corresponding latent representations of these images. I could imagine that this might work since the latent representation is sufficient to reconstruct the original image (i.e. it contains most of the information) is also should be sufficient to compare images. But I am not sure about that point since maybe the spatial layout gets lost in the AE process. Please let me know if you are aware of anybody doing that or something related.

My motivation: AFAIK (but please correct me if there is anything smarter, I am generally very interested in that question) after we have trained our Siamese network or some other Similarity metric learning network in order to find the image in our repository to which a given image is most similar to we have to do pairwise comparisons with every single image in our repository.

Broadly speaking it's a platform for crowdsourcing data. We've made a Chrome Extension which can be plugged into by community-made data collection plugins written in Javascript. The plugins (DataSources) collect data in the background and then send each datapoint to the buyers of the data. The creator of the datapoint will then be paid. Right now, however, there's no money involved and everything is free.

In order to gather data you must make a 'project' on our site, and attach DataSources to the project. Then users enable the DataSources for your project and you start receiving data. For example, I have made a ""Metro Website Usage"" project which aims to gather data about how people use our site (similar to Google Analytics). I've attached a ""metro-dwell-time"" DataSource to it which monitors dwell-time on each page of our website. If you enable it, then every time you navigate to a new page on our site, my project will be sent a bit of JSON with the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `URL`.

It's like Kickstarter for data collection.

There's basically no restrictions right now on what DataSources can be made. You can submit them to us by forking our Metro-DataSources repo on GitHub and then PR'ing us with your DataSource.

Our GitHub is [here](https://github.com/MetroPlatform)

Cross posting here from r/learnmahinelearning.

I've been spending some time looking at the convergence behavior of different neural networks trained on MNIST data and cross-entropy loss. I started by training deeper and deeper networks using sigmoid type activations until the learning efficiency got too low before switching to ReLU activations.

After switching to ReLU activations, my network converged without too many problems but I noticed that the learning rates exhibited an interesting pattern. In particular, it takes a complete epoch before the loss begins to fall. See the loss function below:

[loss function](https://ibb.co/f0xV57)

My weights and biases are initialized uniformly with weights initialized between -0.1 and 0.1. Biases are initialized between 0 and 0.2. My data is centered and normalized but I don't use batch normalization or anything like that.

One thing I noticed is that during the stagnant period the gradients in the first few layers start off virtually zero before becoming large as the network start to learn. Conversely, for the last few layers, the gradients were big during the stagnant period before disappearing. I've given plots of the absolute values of the gradients w.r.t. the biases below (first layer and last layer respectively, the x-axis shows time):

[first layer bias gradients](https://ibb.co/jaEA57)

[last layer bias gradients](https://ibb.co/iZOEXn)

I also did check to see if my ReLUs are dead on initialization but all my activations were positive from the very beginning so this doesn't seem to be the case.

I'm interested in why this is happening mathematically but I can't see anything in the analytically computed derivative that would cause this.",14,7,False,self,,,,,

It looks like that it is a perfect problem for Machine Learning but we have a small problem: They do not have data from real users. They are expanding to the US and it is the only market where prediction of a transaction being good or bad is needed (in Europe all transactions are secured in this business model). So, the solution they have adopted is creating a ""Scoring system"", where financial experts from the company rate a huge amount of transactions, they create a profile for the ""normal user"" and then they try to give weights for each variable. They then give a total score for each transaction and design the threshold for considering a transaction good/bad.

Since I am just an intern without a lot of experience, I want to read the opinions from the experts in this field about that strategy. My point of view is that as long as we do not have data, that system is better than just not using anything at all and it can be good for first days in production. Once we have data, I think that a a good ML model will perform better since it will not be biased from the variables and the more data we have the better it will perform. With this scoring system they want to manually adjust the weights of each variable once we have the data in order to improve the metrics but my thoughts are: ""This is what a ML model does without bias, optimized and automatically"" so I do not know if their system is good or not.

Since I have freedom in this intern, I want to create some models with the data and compare them with the scorer system. I have created a way of comparison (comparing metrics as precision, recall, accuracy) from each system.

I just want to read the opinion from the experts. If this system they have designated has any sense (at least for the beginning), if a ML model is better once we have data for this problem, etc.

I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this questions, but I already posted in r/learnmachinelearning and got no response.

I am wondering what the target for RCNN is in Fast- and Faster-RCNN.
I implemented the Region Proposal Network (RPN) of Faster-RCNN and let it predict the pixel-offset of the target-bounding-boxes compared to the anchors. This seems to work very well for me.

Now it is not clear for me what the target for the next stage (RCNN) is. I tried to predict the pixel offset of the target from the corresponding Region of Interest. But since the RoiPooling can pool over arbitrary sizes, I also tried prediction the relativ offset (%) compared to the size of the RoiPooling window.

When I predict the bounding boxes for simple ellipses it seems like the RPN predictions are way more accurate than the second stage predictions. Now I am wondering what I am doing wrong with my second stage... Could it be that on such a simple test case the RPN is simply better because the input is not pooled?",3,3,False,self,,,,,

I'm struggling here to find a Github implementation of Wavenet and Tacotron-2 that replicates the results posted by Google. How come Google's results are hyper-realistic with no acoustic aberrations; while the open source results leave a lot to be desired?

How do I reproduce their results?

Ali Rahimi's talk got me thinking about what I should be focusing on as a PhD student, and it left me somewhat dissatisfied with current research norms in the field.

Machine learning research has always involved quite a bit of engineering, but we (seem to be) at the point where a large fraction of papers consist of a search in the space of architectures, usually combining previous successful approaches to do even better on some benchmark, with some hand-wavy explanations to support the method.
This seems forgivable for papers coming out of industry--after all, there the ultimate goal is to improve some metric and understanding is secondary, but it seems that ""it achieves state of the art results, QED"" has replaced ""here's a rigorous investigation into why we believe this method works"".

The other issue is that it seems like even if you write a good paper about some method you've developed that achieves SOTA on some task, it's likely been done in industry already and you're just reinventing the wheel.  When I come up with a new architecture for some task, I can't help but thinking that:

* Some smart software engineer at big tech firm X has probably already done this and it's in production
* A software engineer with a good amount of experience in ML engineering *could* have come up with this, just wouldn't have written a paper on it
* Since this is going to be outdated in a few months anyway, my thesis is going to be full of outdated architectures 

As a PhD student doing research in deep learning, how do you approach these issues?",30,66,False,self,,,,,

The training data can be 10,000 instances (of 20 features per instance), which can be used individually (per simple classifier), or arranged in sets of 5 (for the more complex contextual classifier)  resulting in 2000 x 5 sets.

In a simple trained classifier, passing in 5 individual instances could result in probability outputs that look something like this:

[pOrange pApple]

0.1 0.9

0.4 0.6

0.2 0.8

0.7 0.3

0.5 0.5

However, the above set does not take into account the contextual knowledge that we described, it simply deals with each instance individually.  By forcing precisely TWO apples in a set of 5, we can [hopefully] increase our precision + recall by getting rid of some uncertainty.

One typical approach would be to use the output from the simple classifier to train a second classifier, that for example takes 5 features (probability of apple from a set of 5 instances) and attempts to learn how to classify in either a binary or 5-class scenario. 
However, there should be some [recursive/iterative] way to use deep neural nets to perform this task of individual classification-&gt;look probabilities of 5 instances in the set -&gt; adjust probability weights -&gt; repeat until some stopping condition (two clear apples, three clear oranges).  The mini-batching approach should lend itself quite nicely into passing a set of 5 instances through the network, but Im not sure how to implement any contextual knowledge in the layers to create this iterative network.  Possibly Recurrent layers and use of the Long Short-Term memory approach, but Im not an expert in complex deep networks.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Of course simply taking the two items in the set that have the highest probability of Apple might be a valid approach, but I'm wondering if building this contextual knowledge into the network would result in better performance than a simple individual classifier.

While that sounded amazing, FastText came out in 2016 and up to this day, there aren't any tutorials or articles explaining how it should be implemented in to chatbots (or at very least I could not find any). From what is publish I could see that FastText can be used to filter out text and categorize it by it's content which is great for finding spam or offensive messages. But how exactly does that help chatbots give out proper answers?

I tried playing around with the library and attempted to make FastText to recognize three different questions that a client can ask. I gave around 8-12 different examples for each question (I'm not sure how many different ways you can ask ""Where is the paint located""). And the results were... not so accurate. For what ever reason when I asked ""Where can I get some socks"" it predicted that that I was talking about screwdrivers at 0.45 accuracy, while when I asked the location of screwdrivers, the accuracy was 0.64. One thing that may caused it the small dataset I provided, but like I said, is there really a large number of way you can ask the same question?

The more that I read, the more questions I keep coming up with. Today I was reading an article about the evolution of machine learning use in business. Unfortunately, the article didn't give any insight on how the trend may impact business growth in the future. I keep going back and forth on this one...

On the positive side, I can see technologies such as these drastically improving the efficiency of businesses and how they interact/process data, giving companies more time to focus attention on product development and other areas important for a solid bottom line.

However, one could also argue that it could ultimately have a negative impact overall as technology will replace tasks often completed by employees and thus, eliminating job opportunities. I suppose you could argue that this is also a positive thing for business as payroll and benefit expenses would drop or that this would free up money to invest in other areas of the business.

Anyway, my questions are simply; what type of impact do you expect machine learning/neural networks having on business growth in the next 10-15 years or so? Will it favor creating or cutting jobs? ",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm training a feedforward neural network in Keras, and I would like to change only a few elements of the weight matrix, i.e. I would like most of them to remain constant.
One thing I can do is creating another layer which sets all the remaining elements to what I want them to be; but that's not very efficient, since I'd be throwing away most of the quantities I'm computing during training.

The paper introduces Flipout - essentially when you have centred independent along dimensions perturbations (e.g. in 99.99% we are talking Gaussians) you can sample a random sign mask **per example** such that you get computationally cheaply (one extra GEMM) essentially different samples of the parameters for every single example. 

In section 2.2 they pretty much comment that for feedforward network this idea is pretty much identical to LRT. They try to make the claim that this is not the case for shared parameters architectures (e.g. RNNs). However, I'm not really convinced by this since as long as you store the same epsilons per data-point for a weight matrix, then this is indeed applicable to RNNs as well (you basically share the epsilons the same way you share the weights, but they are per output x per data point (DxN matrix). 

So how is the actual effect of this FlipOut any different, except that you are in fact correlating the epsilons with +/- 1 which potentially makes it worse? Additionally, you can as well use LRT with antithetic sampling on the epsilons with potentially better results. And in the comparison, it actually seems to work worse than LRT on feed-forward networks, so why they have not tried LRT on RNNs with sharing? Am I missing something obvious or?",1,9,False,self,,,,,

I don't know if such posts are allowed, if not I would be glad to be directed to a suitable place.
I have been tasked to create some interview questions for hiring more Machine Learning Engineers in our company. When googling this topic most collections of questions are concerning ""Data Scientists"", which then usually are either very general or very specific to some fundamental statistical laws. However I am looking for an Engineer. Ideally a guy that has experience as a Software Engineer but knowledge of machine learning and the ability to understand papers and implement models that solve problems in the E-Commerce domain. So I am looking for a rather practical person and not a Research Scientist.
So I find it pretty difficult to come up with questions without them either being to easy or far to complex.
What would you guys recommend? What questions would you expect from such an interview?

Thanks in advance.",67,154,False,self,,,,,

What other data sets might people be interested in being available via query API?
-----

For a friend, and as personal project, I'm going to be hosting the Million Song Dataset and making it freely, publically accessible via a query API.

Anyone would be able to grab the entire dataset as a csv with a single API call. You'd also be able to ask for only certain columns, limit the number of rows, and do some basic filtering.

An example query:

	{
		dataset: ""million-song-dataset"",
		columns: [
			""song id"",
			""artist id"",
			""duration""
		],
		where: ""duration &lt; 180"",
		limit: 100

Hi, I'm looking for some general advice, sorry if this is the wrong sub.
I finished my PhD (in theoretical high energy physics) about a year ago and decided not to pursue that route anymore. Since then I went over a few ML courses (cs229 and cs231n) and also went over CV and ML papers, and maybe more importantly did some personal projects to get some more hands on experience with DL (I have extensive experience in software development from beforehand). 
I'm now thinking maybe a better way to move forward is to try and get Postdoc in ML that will strengthen my CV. So I have a few questions for this sub:
1) Do you thinks that's even possible? Do you know people with PhDs not in CS or ML that got ""good"" postdocs?
2) From your experience, is it worth the time? Currently I have the feeling that if I ever want to be a CTO of a startup in the field or a researcher in one of the larger companies being self taught in the field isn't going to cut it. 
3) If you think it's possible and worth the time and effort, what's the best way to find such a Postdoc? (physics is a much smaller field with different rules)

Thanks!",22,3,False,self,,,,,

My name is Nathan Shepherd and I am a Junior at the University of Michigan studying Machine Learning. I am currently writing a research paper entitled ""Intelligent Human-Computer Interface"" that details a new form of Artificial Intelligence. **This AI system could potentially be useful to anyone that uses a computer on a regular basis.** To ensure the usefulness of the system I develop, I would like to compare its performance on various computer tasks to that of a human performing the same task. This is where I could use your assistance, if you have the time.

**I would only need a total of 20 minutes at some point over the next two weeks to collect enough data.** You would be playing 3 computer games in your browser for around 5 minutes each. Your scores after playing the games would then be recorded via a google form. These games can be played independently on your computer whenever you have the free time. 

The data collected will be used in my research into a reinforcement learning algorithm. My goal is to write a program that will assist any user with their general computer tasks. **Your scores will be used (as an average) to determine if the algorithm used has approached human level performance on various browser tasks.** You have the option to remain anonymous should you choose to participate.

If you would like a preview of the games, they can all be found at the following link: [Mini World of Bits Index](http://alpha.openai.com/miniwob/preview/index.html). If you would like more specific details on the scope of my research you can view my Research Proposal via Google Docs: [Research Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwpG75SjX0KFwQf5sk8_HkrwDcyq4WWW4Ab7NHGsM8E/edit?usp=sharing) (it is a bit lengthy, the first and last paragraph might be the most relevant to you). My research paper and my implementation of this system will be released publicly towards the end of April 2018.

**In order to assist with this project you will need to fill out this [Research Participation Consent Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/gKrR6upGQYnJSRJV2)** I will be sending out assigned games to those that fill out this survey.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention.

Kind Regards,
Nathan Shepherd

The killing of a human being by intelligent machine is certainly disturbing and tragic. Really a sad new line in ethics has been crossed for us as toolmakers. However, dispassionate examination of driverless cars suggests that they have the potential to reduce human suffering and save lives. So I think some people are concerned about the wrong implications of machine intelligence:

What troubles me goes deeper than safety. My issue is with the disregard towards people who are potentially paying the cost to bootstrap machine intelligence. The woman who was killed by a driverless Uber car never agreed to share the road (a public space payed for by taxpayers) with a prototype of an autonomous machine (the product of a private entity in pursuit of profit). No one even asked her.

No other product is beta tested in such a manner. Participants are unable to consent because they are totally unaware of any risk, even though that risk is potentially death. The prototype's workings are kept entirely a secret deliberately.

This secrecy needs to end. All human beings should be granted, as an inalienable right, the ability to access all information on the function of machines that make life and death decisions for them. I don't see any way to deny people Free and Open design and claim morality. 

I'm aware of the ""black box"" effect that neural networks exhibit. I don't think this undermines the need for transparency at all. The algorithms should absolutely still be public. Machine learning does not float unattached outside an autonomous vehicle. We still need to see operation of firmware, mechanicals, etc. Malware for low level software like firmware exists and is very successful; it will be written for self driving cars.

Suppose I approach a driverless car lot and offer the salespeople a wheelbarrow of money. In return, they modify my car's software to kill anyone else in order to preserve my life in an accident. Legislative change might prevent this nightmare but why not just require intelligent machines in general to have free and open code? The promises of Uber and any other corporation are not sufficient here. 

Could Uber withhold designs or source code if their recent killing is brought to trial? If yes, where would we find certainty about their claims?

If you were someone such as Edward Snowden, would you use a closed source based autonomous vehicle? If no, then why should anyone?

The data has been cleaned up and transformed so that it is uniform across different countries.
It contains matches from annual cup competitions in each country plus the main league and second-tier, third-tier leagues for major countries.

As you can see in this [diagram](https://imgur.com/P85voL5) there are a couple of tables:

 * Using the match.id you can connect to the rest of the tables and obtain extra information about the home / away team.
 * league statistics contains a snapshot of the league table before the game was played
 * last matches contain the 10 last matches played by the home / away team per each id.

Here's some of my questions:

 * do you think I could commercialize this data?
 * if you are interested in this data how much would you be willing to pay (0$ is a valid option) for a daily updated database?
 * would sqlite be a format you can work with or do you prefer something else?

Thanks for the help!

I have one question regarding the LSTM in the process block. What should be the initial state and the initial input of this LSTM? The paper mentioned that the exact equations and implementation of the read, process, and write block will be released in an appendix. However, I cannot find the appendix online.

I saw another paper, [Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09940), using a similar approach to obtain an embedding for a set of inputs. They use the last hidden state of the encoder as the initial state, and a trainable d-dimensional vector as the initial input to the LSTM. Does these two papers use the same way to initialze the LSTM in the process block? Many thanks!

For example, if there are 4 items of data, a single ""sweep"" of 4 iterations of SGD might use items 0, 3, 0, 3, so computing the average loss for these 4 iterations would not be representative of the learning on the whole dataset.

How is this generally dealt with?  In my current implementation I have a while loop, and inside that a for loop from i to `numTrainingItems`, so originally I was trying to take the average loss incurred on a given random sweep through the training data, but was finding that a given sweep might pick item 0 all 4 times, for example.

Perhaps this is a problem with my ""dataset"" (just the input/output pairs for XOR) being very small. But in general, is loss averaged during SGD, or how else is it dealt with?",7,2,False,self,,,,,

I need to create a Restaurant Recommendation system (or use any that is already trained (haven't found any until now)) that gets user preferences (for example: User A likes sushi, pizza, burgers; User B likes: soup  etc.) and returns the top of restaurants (order of known restaurants). I don't want to use ratings that users gave to the restaurants (I don't have ratings given by users in my project) (I want it to be irrelevant, what matters is what they like). 

So, I want to train on such data (with outputs being a top of restaurants) and for any new given user to give me a top of restaurants. (according to his preferences).

Now what I've tried is to use LightFM, but it is complicated when talking about user preferences. And it also doesn't seem to work with new users.

So any idea if this is possible? And if yes any hints on what may work?

PS: To tell you exactly what we want to do in this project:
A user creates an account, creates a list of maximum n features (like the above: pizza, soup etc (known features, he will choose from a list) -&gt; then according to the area get the nearby restaurants and recommend him, in an order, the restaurants that are nearby and work best with what he wants (features).

# The Basic Idea

The basic idea of random search is, more or less, to:

1. choose K directions d1,...,dK (in policy parameter space)
2. estimate, numerically, the corresponding K directional derivatives of the cumulative rewards wrt the parameters of the policy
3. get the final update direction as an average of the directions weighted by their directional derivatives.

# Multi-Task Environment

Let's consider a simple environment where:

* every episode lasts T timesteps
* the initial state is chosen uniformly from N initial states, {s1, ..., sN}
* trajectories from different initial states are completely independent

You may imagine an environment which is a collection of N independent tasks which are randomly selected at the beginning of each episode.

# The Problem

Let's try to ""solve the Environment"" described above.

We take rollouts of length T, so that each rollout is a full episode. Also, we decide to use D directions.

We start with the first direction d1 and perturb the policy this way:

* pi1(x; theta) = pi(x; theta + c d1)
* pi2(x; theta) = pi(x; theta - c d1)

Now we evaluate pi1 on one rollout and pi2 on another rollout:

* totReward1 = sum of all rewards accumulated along rollout 1 when following pi1
* totReward2 = sum of all rewards accumulated along rollout 2 when following pi2

Finally, we evaluate the improvement along direction d1 by comparing totReward1 with totReward2. Let's say totReward2 &gt; totReward1, but rollout 1 is about playing football and rollout 2 is about playing the piano. Our gradient estimation is completely useless. Indeed we can have totReward2 &gt; totReward1 and yet the perturbation along d1 worsens our performance in both playing football and playing the piano.

Note that only 100/N% of the directional derivatives are estimated correctly!

I'd say that random search, at least used that way, does updates which are not ""*state-aware*"".

Classical methods would have no problems with such an environment because they do updates which are state-aware. For instance, in policy gradient methods we use a loss of the form

    mean_i log pi(a_i|s_i) R_i

where Ri is the return or the advantage accumulated starting from si and following the current policy (unless we're learning off-policy).

# The lesson(?)

Maybe we may relax classical algorithms and make their updates less state-aware when appropriate. For instance, we might collect many rollouts and improve the policy both in parameter and in action space, weighting each improvement according to some divergence of the state distribution of the rollouts, or something like that.

As always, please let me know if I made mistakes or misunderstood something. Thank you for reading!",18,7,False,self,,,,,

Tacotron Model:
&gt; The Tacotron models were pretrained models available from the best public implementation we could find, which is by Ito (2017b). This re-implementation has models only for the LJ and the Nancy datasets. Note that Tacotron has raised a lot of attention and considerable effort was put by the community to replicate the papers results.

Scoring Method: 
&gt; The MOS scores are shown in Tab. 2. These were computed using the same_sentence option of crowdMOS, following DV2 (personal communication). As can be seen, our single speaker results are better than those of the other two algorithms across datasets, but still somewhat lower than the ground truth results.

Replication Results:

Method | LJ | Blizzard 2011 | Blizzard 2013

I've been working as a datascience consultant for a year now in one of the biggest/best datascience consulting outfits in Paris, thinking wrongly that the technical/theoretical level would be higher than it is. I am doing really basic regressions in R and pumping out powerpoint presentations.

I've been trying for the last 3 months to find positions in any company that claims to have an AI research division. The problem is for smaller companies, I found that most offers with AI in the title are basically doing what my consulting firm does, use AI and datascience as buzzwords to upsell themselves. I really do not want to change jobs only to do basic stuff and powerpoint presentations. And for the big ones, the few positions I come across for which I know the company really does research (Google, FB and co) I haven't been able to go past the HR phone interview (I have applied worldwide). Seeing as these positions ask for PhDs or MScs, my questions would be:

1. Considering my background and experience, am I deluded in thinking I have a shot at the big ones ?
2. If I don't have a shot, why? Is it because of a lack of education ? the perceived quality of my education (not stanford or MIT) ? Is it because I pigeonholed myself in a consulting job ?
3. What should I do to maximize my chances, should I go back to academia and get a PhD ? Should I work in an AI startup to wash away the consultant stigma/ build my public github (can't really share what I'm doing as a consultant) ? ",83,91,False,self,,,,,

The doc is [here](https://seqtools-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the code on [github](https://github.com/nlgranger/SeqTools).

Basically, it looks like python's itertools or tensorpack, but instead of working with iterators, it works on sequences (lists, arrays, anything indexable with a length).

Features:

- everything behaves just like a python list: index based access, iter compatibility, **slicing is also supported**, **assignment is supported when possible**
- mapping functions to build transformation pipelines
- everything is **lazy-evaluated** so a whole pipeline can be built instantly and you can then request the computation of specific items on demand.
- a prefetch function to munch data with multiple threads/processes
- type agnostic, you can put items of variable type and size in your sequence, it doesn't matter.
- indexing, you are not limited to iterating, you can access specific items at will, .

I can add more functionalities and pull requests are welcome :-)

Example:

    def f1(x):
        return x + 1
    
    def f2(x):
        # This is slow and memory heavy
        time.sleep(.01)

    def f3(x):
        return sum(x) / len(x)
    
    arr = list(range(1000))

    tmp1 = seqtools.smap(f1, arr)
    tmp2 = seqtools.smap(f2, tmp1)  # instantaneous
    res = seqtools.smap(f3, tmp2)
    print(res[2])  # fast because only one value is processed

    print(max(tmp2[2]))  # it's still possible to probe intermediate values

Hi folks. We're building a transparent platform for crowdsourcing data, using community-made, open source data-collection plugins (written in Javascript) called DataSources. DataSources are dynamically plugged into our Chrome Extension and can collect basically any browser-related data to be sent off to us for distribution to the appropriate buyer/project.

The goal is to empower the community to control the collection of data, allowing individuals to collect and sell their own data, allowing project owners to access high quality raw data that's normally reserved for Google/Facebook, and ensuring that the creators of data are actually compensated. You can see a more in-depth explanation of the project [here](https://metro.exchange/about/).

We've implemented the most valuable improvements, made some bugfixes, and opened sign-ups publicly for an open beta:

* [**Open Data Projects**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/83mpk5/p_were_making_a_transparent_communitydriven/dvjc5ef/) - Essentially this means open source datasets, meaning that all contributors to an Open Data project can access all of the data. We really liked this idea so it was the main priority for this release.
* **Unlisted Projects** - Sometimes you don't want data contributions from anybody, so we've made it possible to create an unlisted project. You can therefore keep the project to yourself, or share it among a specific group of people.
* [**Load Speed Improvements**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/83mpk5/p_were_making_a_transparent_communitydriven/dvj849y/) - We've sped up the landing page by properly compressing our images. We're minifying CSS already but we still have to implement JS minification
* **Direct Data Download** - You can now download the data from a project directly through a download button (previously we emailed out download links after preparing the zip behind the scenes).
* [**Add non-minified code to Chrome Extension**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/83mpk5/p_were_making_a_transparent_communitydriven/dvlc6w3/) - We've made all vendor code in the Extension un-minified so it should be easy to inspect it now.
* **Project/DataSource stats** - We've added some stats to the Project and DataSource pages, giving info about the flow of data.
* **Concept Description Improvements** - We've had some trouble getting the concept across to people so we've added some more descriptive explanations of what exactly Metro is and how it works. We don't have money to work with an artist to create high-quality diagrams and artwork, so we're doing the best we can with just words.

We're confident that the system will work with relatively few issues, but we are full-time students so we really don't expect everything to work flawlessly. This project is just 3 months old now and we're learning as we go so please keep an open mind if you come across any issues. You can email us at feedback@metro.exchange or use the form on the website if you find any issues or want to suggest any changes.

You can see our planned future improvements [here](https://metro.exchange/about/).

----------------------------

## How To Get Data

1. First, make a project on the website.  
2. Next, attach DataSources to the project by visiting the DataSource's page and clicking ""Get Data"" (to create your own DataSources, see [here](https://metro.exchange/develop/))  
3. When users install our Chrome Extension, they can click ""Enable"" on each DataSource on your project's page and the data collection and transfer will start automatically.  
4. You can download your data from the ""data"" tab of the project's page.

-------------------------------

Our names are Rory and Conor. We're undergraduate students at Dublin City University. Thanks for reading this and we hope you find Metro useful in some way. We're looking forward to getting feedback and making improvements. 

We're swamped with college work right now, but once we have the time and money to work on this full-time we'll be making it our mission to build a platform that benefits data science and regular users together, helping to make data a force for good in the world.",6,11,False,self,,,,,

[https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials/blob/master/1-seq2seq.ipynb](https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials/blob/master/1-seq2seq.ipynb).

The encoder and the decoder both deal with inputs and outputs of size *embedding_size* after the original input is first fed through an embedding lookup table. My question regards the method for returning to the *vocabulary_size* world. In the tutorial, a linear layer is trained with softmax. However, this seems to me to be un-ideal for two reasons:

* 1) the decoder outputs now exist in a different vector space compared with the embedding vector space. While they share the same dimensions, the meanings of the space are not the same. E.g. point X means 'dog' in the embedding space ('dog' token has a value of X in the lookup table), but the same valued point X in the decoder output space no longer necessarily means 'dog'. This forces the decoder to learn a new meaning space rather than re-use the one learned by the embedding lookup, which seems like additional effort for the network.
* 2) the softmax will return weak gradients for a large *vocabulary_size*, making the learning more difficult.


Instead of the linear projection layer method, I was wondering if I could instead use a reverse embedding lookup. In terms of the method, I was thinking of something like this:

* the loss objective is the l2 distance between the decoder output and the embedding lookup of the ground truth
* to reduce the decoder output to the tokens, do an argmax to find the nearest point in the embedding lookup table.
* apply losses on the embedding variable to ensure that the distribution of the embeddings does not collapse
* at inference time, for each time step, feed in the embedding lookup of the reverse lookup of the decoder output in the previous step (collapse each decoder output to nearest point in the embedding lookup)

I've tried running this variation and the network doesn't seem to converge. I've looked through the steps and in my mind the gradients should flow through (the argmax steps are just for interpretation and are not involved in the loss computation so the gradients don't need to flow through those).

Can anyone point me in the right direction to understand why this method might not work? Thanks!",4,3,False,self,,,,,

Each label in the training set in this scenario is one class from the specified subset, **y^(i)  ^(i)**. In other words, the model is given prior knowledge that the true label is in a given subset of the global classes.

For context, I'm asking this question generally to learn about the scope of solutions to this problem, but expect to apply this in the text classification setting.

Is there a class of multi-class methods that aim to address this scenario? I'm unsure of the terminology about predicting over a subset of global classes.

Are there multi-class classifiers that are designed to take advantage of previous knowledge of a limited solution space? And to further complicate the scenario, what if classes could be hierarchical or otherwise related in such a way that multiple answers could be correct but only one correct class is available in **^(i)**? Bad example: we can imagine a setting where ""Robin Williams"" and ""the lead actor"" are both answers to a question-answering or information extraction problem. In this case, we may not want to punish predictions outside of **^(i)**, but instead only have the model learn to improve future likelihood of predicting **y^(i)** (known positive) and decrease likelihood of **^(i) - y^(i)** (known negatives), while mostly or fully ignoring **C - ^(i)**.",1,5,False,self,,,,,

A few weeks back I started making a program with the task of teaching itself to play [the game 2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). I seem to have gotten positive results, though I haven't properly confirmed them. This is how it works (I'll be using correct terminology to the best of my ability, though I might make mistakes):

100 *players* are generated, each having 64 *nodes*; 16 for each of the four possible directions of movement in the game. The nodes are then assigned a random value between 0 and 1000 (it's actually between 0 and 1 with 0.001 increments, but the division by 1000 happens during the processing of information).

Each player then plays the game until it loses, 100 times. Each round will produce a score equal to the number of moves made before losing the game, and after 100 rounds, the player's score for that round will be the average score of its 100 games. Once all players have played 100 games, the 50 players with the lowest score are removed and the other 50 get one *offspring* each. The offspring will be similar to its ""parent"", though the value of each of the 64 nodes will be equal to the parent's corresponding node  10. Then the process is repeated for the new set of 100 ""players"".

The simple way of explaining how the program determines its next move, is that it does it by feeding the value of each of the 16 slots on the board through its nodes for each of the four directions, by multiplying it with (the node's value / 1000). It is actually a bit more complicated than this, but that's not important. This will give each possible direction a score, and the program will make the legal move with the highest score. This is continued until the game is lost.

After 1000 generations, I was able to get the game to perform a lot better than random movement, and also, on average, better than I can do myself when playing the game. Where do I go from here? Is this actually machine learning? How do I evaluate whether my results are real? Any feedback would be highly appreciated! ",13,13,False,self,,,,,

The first problem I encountered is that allocating streams dynamically and disposing of them when done takes an enormous amount of time relative to the rest.

I implemented a one layer multiplicative integration RNN which takes about 5.4s to go through the 1mb `tiny_shakespeare.txt` dataset once. It has two gemm operations that could be done in parallel, and streaming them make the time go up to 5.8s per epoch. Doing them on two separate streams (vs the original and one extra stream) makes the time go up 8.8s. Then as an experiment I tried allocating and disposing of bunch of streams that do nothing and found that the time goes up by 1s per stream.

The other problem is that the Cuda concurrency model is garbage and that even if it were costless and trivial to deal with streams which is not the case at all now, it would potentially lead to data races.

Cuda streams are simply a bad idea. If one of Nvidia's competitors comes up with a solution that leverages the actor model for concurrency and offers garbage collected virtual memory on top of that, the company can expect its ML market share to vanish.

The question in the title is meant as query of the level of development of the mainstream ML frameworks and libraries. I often heard something to this effect echoed on this sub: ""All the libraries just pipe to cuDNN so they should all have the same performance.""

Not only is there not a shred of evidence in the notion that they all have the same performance, but as a counterpoint for why that might be bullshit, consider the simple matrix multiply as is found in the cuBLAS library.

It is fine if one just wants to multiple two matrices together `W * x`, but doing just that is never the case in ML. As a minimum one would want to add bias to the result: `W * x + b`. And then that is chained into an activation function: `f(W * x + b)`.

Sigmoid, tanh and relu have the appealing property of not even needing intermediates for the backwards step, so ideally `f(W * x + b)` should be done in a single fused kernel rather than 3, and similarly the same should be done for the backward step rather than 4. The situation is even worse for RNNs: `f(W * x + U * h + b)` which would need 4 forward steps, and 6 backward steps (in which the error term is continually loaded again from memory.) Those CuBlas matrix multiplies literally force the creation of intermediates that could otherwise be avoided.

In summary, if the ML library is only piping things to the Cuda libraries, then it is way slower than it would be otherwise because those libraries are not composable and hence the calls to their functions cannot be fused.

Currently, my own library does not do this sort of thing, but given the sheer non-composability of the Cuda library functions, I am definitely considering building such a component. The [language](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language) I've made should definitely be capable of doing such a thing.

Since I am competing with Tensorflow and PyTorch, but do not know much about them this is good time to ask whether those frameworks do this vital optimization? If they do so, that would actually be impressive.

Since I do not actually expect them to be capable of this, do **any** libraries exist that do this sort of thing?",6,8,False,self,,,,,

the idea is simple, say our batch size is 128, then we randomly hold out M samples from this, say 3 samples. the rest 125 are used to calculate the gradient for the update step **g_updt**, while the remaining M samples are used to calculate a test gradient **g_test**. The idea is that if **g_updt** were catering to the need of a 'not diverse' population, then its angle (dot product) with the held out gradient might be negative. We can consider such a gradient not so 'general', and choose either to temper its impact by a factor or choose not to add it at all.

Please poke holes in this argument, suggest any thought/programmable experiments etc.

Some issues I am not so sure about include:

1. The exploratory role of minibatch methods. There is a view that gradients from considering minibatches rather than the complete dataset in one go provide a noisy exploratory effect for the optimization. In such a case where does my hypothesis lie? Am I trying to do too much computation with an inherently inexact gradient?

2. the rule for what to do with gradients during update. should i consider each layer weights as a separate vector, and independently decide for each layer whether to suppress gradients or not, or whether i should consider the complete parameter gradients as a single vector choosing to act on it as a whole.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

I hope that it might be useful for anyone interested in using machine learning with video inputs. The code is here:

https://github.com/dukebw/lintel

I wrote Lintel to provide video decoding on the fly in machine learning input pipelines, for working on video datasets such as Kinetics, NTU RGB+D, ActivityNet, UCF-101, Charades, etc.

Currently there are two Python interfaces to Lintel: one decodes a sequence of frames from a (potentially randomized) position in the video. The other decodes and returns a specific set of frames, passed as a list of frame indices.

The major advantage of Lintel is that it is extremely fast and space efficient to decode video on the fly, as opposed to the alternative of storing all videos as a sequence of JPEG images, which I have also seen.

The core of the library uses the C interface to FFmpeg's libraries, so the code does need to be compiled, with a current development version of FFmpeg available. There are installation instructions on the GitHub README.",4,40,False,self,,,,,

After further research, there have been other shortcomings related to ""Watson"". Mainly overpromising and under-delivering.

Since my dad and my older brother are both research scientists with PhDs, theyve always encouraged me to also get a PhD but I never liked the idea of spending 5-6 additional years in school.

To give some background about myself, Im currently a 2nd year undergrad student. The reason why I decided to consider grad school as an option is because of my recent involvement with a university team that develops autonomous vehicles. Most of the work I do there is much more engineering than research (e.g. optimizing parameters of existing CV algos, interfacing with sensors and fighting drivers, writing ROS nodes, etc) but as an aside Ive been reading up on a lot of papers and recent development in perception for autonomous vehicles.

Im also taking 2 grad-level courses that focus on deep learning and robotics, and theyve been a blast so far. One particular course covers deep learning for autonomous vehicles, and I honestly really like learning about different flavors of convolutional neural networks, how different approaches and optimizations produce different results, and what kind of heuristics people take to get better results. Ive also been invited to participate in a weekly paper reading session with grad students discussing GAN, and that has been a lot of fun even though I dont necessarily understand everything.

Another reason I want to consider a PhD is because Im not super confident that Im interested in becoming a software developer. I dont have an inherent interesting in programming like some of my peers, and Ive learned through my last 2 internships where I worked as a software developer working in web development and devops that I really dont enjoy it (I do appreciate the good lessons I learned from DevOps, though). 

Im headed to NVIDIA this summer to work on autonomous vehicles as an engineer, though, and Im hoping I enjoy this internship more than my past ones. I also like doing things where I can see the results visually (hence my interest in computer vision, robotics, graphics, etc). 

I guess I have several questions:

For somebody whos utmost interest is applications (e.g. robotics, graphics), is a PhD even a good idea? (And by extension, what kind of person is a PhD suited for?)
How should I go about the rest of my undergrad to try to get into a good PhD program, or even just to prepare to be a successful PhD student?

For 2, Ive been thinking about maybe trying to do research somewhere in my university. Our university doesnt really do much research in deep learning, though. Ive also vaguely heard that you need a high GPA to get into good grad school programs, but my GPA isnt top notch (I have around a 3.6 / 4.0 GPA, I do go to a relatively reputable university though). 

For the preparation part, recently Ive been confused about what I should prioritize in my life. Should I just read more papers and textbooks? Should I practice to become a better software engineer? Should I try to get a more solid, deep understanding of tools used in ML?

My ultimate goal is to work in industry on autonomous vehicles, or a similar robotics related project.

I also sometimes dont think Im inherently smart enough to dive into pure research. I have a good enough understanding of linear algebra and statistics to understand concepts, but I dont think I have full control over it, especially the more abstract it gets. There are also certain papers (often very theoretical ones about ML) that fly straight over my head.",4,3,False,self,,,,,

I made up my mind on to buy a GTX 1060 6gb so I don't depend on cloud GPUs anymore.

However I see there are a lot of different models available.

How should I pick? I guess I should pick one with 2 fans? But that still leaves a lot to choose from:

I have a question: I have a large number of emails coming from an auction site similar to ebay (like the ebay of my country).

From these emails, I want to extract different data, like the users address, email, price of the item etc. Some of this data is structured in the email, as it can be entered by the site and is then sent in table form to the seller.

 Other info is unstructured, as the user is given a field for comments to be added. The info in the table needs to be extracted and checked for consistency. Any missing info needs to be found out and listed as the buyer needs to recieve an email where that information is requested. Additionally, the unscructured info should be extracted as well and written to the fields most appropriate (i.e some buyers write their pphone number into the ""additional info"" field instead of the phone number field. 

Here is an example with anon data: https://imgur.com/a/mJQLE

Would this be a problem that could be solved my ML? Are there any models that could perform this task already with some training or do I need to start from scratch for this?

Thanks for your insights.",6,6,False,self,,,,,

It is different than most pytorch/tensorflow implementations in that it doesn't read the darknet configs and just runs them, but is rather a library containing all the building blocks to (re)create any darknet type network.

Some of its key features:

* Contains all the building blocks for darknet type networks. (loss, layers, data augmentation, ...)
* Extensive [documentation](https://eavise.gitlab.io/lightnet)
* Can use darknet weight files, and reaches same [accuracy](https://eavise.gitlab.io/lightnet/notes/03-compare_score.html) with them. (There are slight machine epsilon differences between darknet and lightnet, but oh well...)
* Implemented the same training routines and reached comparable results with it.
* For some reason, my implementation is about **2x** faster than the original Yolo. I guess this has to do with the optimisations in PyTorch, because I did nothing special to be faster.
* Python code is more readable than C imo...

I will probably keep using Lightnet through my research and add various bits to it that I need. This means it will probably become more of a general purpose library and less of a *'I want Yolo in PyTorch'* kind of thing.  
I might take a look at the newly released YoloV3, but as my focus is more towards embedded systems I don't feel like using a network that is twice as deep...

Anyway, I felt like sharing my work, so here it is! ([Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/eavise/lightnet))  
Feel free to use anything of it however you want, as long as you give me credits somehow :)

However, I have not been able to find consistent explanations for what is meant when an LSTM layer has multiple hidden units. Does this simply mean that there are multiple LSTM ""blocks"" working in parallel, and their outputs at each step are concatenated? Is there an additional dimension added to the memory cell state and the weight matrix? If, for example, I have an input of N steps, each step consisting of an m x n plane of data, what would it look like for there to be multiple hidden units?

I have a time series dataset of 5 sensors, configured in 60 or so identical environments (i.e. nutrient solution). The environments appear to have 3 distinct phases, which have been labelled in the dataset. 

Random forests applied to the entire dataset: 75% train 25% test yields a mean accuracy score of 96%. 

This is a great sign, but how can I go from modeling the entire dataset to the individual environments? Taking ""per-environment"" subsets, splitting into training and testing data and repeat? Or is there a way to leverage the entire dataset to improve classification on each environment?

Each conference paper poster seems to be assigned a specific day for exposition.

I have some doubts:

* Are workshop posters also assigned a specific day?
* If so, are posters hanged early in the morning the very same day they are to be exposed or else when?
* Do people wander around and chat with authors of posters that draw their attention?
* Is there any other way/occasion to engage in fruitful conversation that could lead to exchange of ideas or even a collaboration ?
* Do people exchange business cards when introducing themselves to other people ?

Any other piece of information/advice about how these things work is also highly appreciated. It's my first time in a conference (I have a workshop paper accepted) and I would like to maximize the outcome of attending.

I plan to run 4 GTX 1080 TI at max performance (i did research enough to find what is required to make it run at max performance and dissipate the heat, so that's alright).

But now I am wondering if the speed 2400 MHz memory and CL17 makes a noticeable difference instead of using 2667 MHz and CL 16.

I am imagining to store as much data as I can on memory for quick read from the GPUs and restock the memory once its available (like most people do with their DL machine).

-Memory: 128 GB (ECC) CPU: 1900x threadripper
-Data will be stored in an HDD 7200 rpm. Perhaps this is slow enough that the reduced speed of the ram is negligible.

4 GTXs are expensive and if this makes some noticeable difference, I won't hesitate to pay the extra price for it, but I am just wondering if it really makes a difference or am I just throwing money away for ""good specs"" that in reality doesn't make a real difference.

The main reason is that I was looking at a RAM with 2667 MHz and had a good price, but it didn't have ECC. I then opted for an ECC RAM, but the price was quite more expensive. However, I managed to find one for a very similar price, just at a slower speed.

If this affects different types of models differently, I am mostly interested in the effects for: CNN and RNN/LSTM.

Expected learning time of the model: 1 day to 1 week (huge uncertainty here, I know, though I appreciate a good oversight over this range).

Thank you very much for the assistance.

However Google did not release the weights for all thoses networks, so a community has formed trying to reproduce and maybe improve the AlphaZero engine. 

To do this, a distributed effort to play self-play games has started, and the training is done on a single powerful computer (It can update the weights in about 5 hours currently). 

You can see the self-play ELO curve (not representative of real ELO) on the [website](http://lczero.org/). 

If you want to help the project by sharing your GPU/CPU, think about following the instructions on the ""Getting Started"" section of the website.

As of now, it would take about 400 days to reach the 44.000.000 games played by Deepmind, but that could change thanks to you!

We have planned some steps to make the repo up-to-date:

- Add documentation
- Add A3C, PPO and Rainbow
- Review PR &amp; Issues

What do you think? Any suggestions to make it awesome?

In order to achieve this, we are working on a book that will introduce DeepLearning to the Java engineers. In the book, we are going to introduce main concepts, step by step, along the way of building the framework and only when required. For example, the current version of the DJ does not have batching support, because at this point we are not using any matrix representation of layers. As a consequence training MNist model have the following numbers:

* ~2 min to get ~11% error rate;
* ~10hours to get ~7% error rate;

Training code can be found [here](https://github.com/DeepJavaUniverse/DJ-ModelZoo/tree/master/src/main/java/com/dj/models/mnist). 

This(slow training of the first real model) is a good spot to introduce concepts of linear algebra in order to showcase how the transition from classic graph representation to the matrix based approach will improve speed.

Finally, in addition to the framework release, we are also releasing the draft of the [chapter](https://deep-learning-from-scratch.gitbooks.io/deep-learning-from-scratch-for-java-engineers/content/chapter-2-our-first-neural-network.html) of the book. The chapter has 1:1 mapping with the code from the [special branch](https://github.com/DeepJavaUniverse/DJ-core/tree/chapter_2) in our repository.",4,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm about to publish a paper on it, but I found one paper uploaded to arXiv in the middle of February and submitted to ICLR workshop that accomplished one of three key contributions of my work: modifying an existing RL algorithm to make it applicable to vastly different, more diverse problems, though they were not aware that it could be applied to problems even more diverse than what they thought.  

This paper attracted pretty much no attention, so I hadn't seen it anywhere until I did an extensive literature search using arxiv-sanity to cite as many related works as possible. I also later found it on openreview, where the paper was rejected for using a very tiny problem only. This is a very short paper with almost no detail described (even compared with other ICLR workshop papers), which is another reason for rejection. The reason why it took about four months to publish my paper is that it required a drastic speedup of my algorithm to make it applicable to realistically large-scale problems, which was not necessary for them due to their tiny problem. 

Needless to say, I'll mention this paper in my Related Works section. Now, should I briefly explain in the section about some of the aforementioned circumstances and mention that my work was concurrently and independently done and therefore claim the novelty of my contribution in this sense? Is there any useful criteria for novelty and concurrency of works?

The way I see it is: RPN has access to the whole feature-map (e.g. input_size/32px for ResNet50) and makes a prediction for anchor offsets and probability of object (for those anchor offsets). ROIPool would then do a one-level spatial pyramid pool on the pixels inside that predicted anchor-offset and feed into classifier. If our predicted bounding-box is e.g. 2x2 then the receptive field for the classification after ROIPool will have a receptive field of 64x64 pixels in the original image ... however the RPN already has access to the full image already?

Or is it just a case of extra parameters - stacking similar classifiers on each other?

Further, if ROIPool helps with single-class, then ROIAlign is expected to improve the performance also?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Because the synth is chaotic and a modular design, modifying different combinations of parameters at different times gives a mixture of varying results. Decreasing param1 while increasing param2 might make the synth quieter, but only if param3 is below a certain amount for example.

I am currently using a genetic algorithm that iteratively generates 24 mutated parameters and selects which provided the quietest output. However, due to the chaotic relationship between parameters randomly mutating ends almost 'resetting' the progress it makes.

 The first article is published, each week 2 articles will be published, but **if you want to be alerted about the next article, follow me on Medium and/or follow the github repo below**

I wrote these articles because I wanted to have articles that begin with the big picture (understand the concept in simpler terms), then the mathematical implementation and finally a Tensorflow implementation **explained step by step** (each part of the code is commented). And too much articles missed the implementation part or just give the code without any comments.

Let me see what you think! What architectures you want and any feedback.

**The first article**: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419

**The first notebook**: https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/blob/master/Q%20learning/Q%20Learning%20with%20FrozenLake.ipynb

Thanks!
