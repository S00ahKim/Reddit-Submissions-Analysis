We know AIs can make music, photorealistic images, video games(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDf31W9zxQ0) so what is stopping it from making videos and youtube accounts and trying to get followers? 

Maybe 1 day in the near future an AI will create a youtube channel that will get millions of subscribers?

For example this channel(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYBEb0k6KhrsUK3KN17kTg/videos) seems to be more or less random. It could be created by someone just combining a bunch of different video and audio clips in a random order and generating titles but maybe an AI could also be doing the same thing. I've seen other youtube channels that create seemingly nonsense or even bad content but upload multiple times a day. I saw a gaming channel for a racing game where the driving looked almost exactly like what you would see in this self driving car project(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5xpXecR3LY)

I know this question has been asked many times, but I would like to ask it still.

So, I'm a student of applied math at European university, which is around 200-225th places in CS/Math in most of the ratings. I did and will do the following math coursework (I'm going to finish my Master studies next year):

1) Real Analysis 1 (sequences, limits, differentiations)

2) Real Analysis 2 (Taylor polynomial, Series, Power Series, Riemann integration, Improper Riemann integral)

3) Real Analysis 3 (Functional sequences and series, Fourier series, Topology, Differential calculus in generalized spaces)

4) Real Analysis 4 (Measure theory, Lebesgue integral, Differential forms, Surface/Line integrals, Exterior algebras, Basics of complex analysis)

5) Linear Algebra 1 (Vector spaces, Bases, Subspaces, Linear transformations)

6) Linear Algebra 2 (Inverse matrices, Determinants, Spectral theory, Quadratics forms and inner products, Riesz theorem, Intro to linear operator theory)

7) Ordinary Differential Equations

8) Numerical Math 1 (Numerical integration, Differentiation, Numerical linear algebra)

9) Numerical Math 2 (Solving ODE, Nonlinear equations, Solving PDE)

10) Modern Real Analysis (Intro to PDE theory, Generalized functions, Integral transformations, Integral equations, Fourier transformations)

11) Complex Analysis

12) Probability and Mathematical Statistics 1,2 

13) General Algebra

14) Topology

15) Linear Programming

16) Theory of Markov Chains

17) Statistical Decision Theory

18) Functional Analysis 1,2 - All about operators, Hilbert and Banach spaces

19) Calculus of Variations

20) Graph Theory

21) Random Process Theory

22) Advanced Numerical Linear Algebra

23) Information Theory 

24) Regression Analysis

25) Linear Models

26) Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence

27) Nonlinear Programming

28) Statistical Learning Theory 

And few other specific math courses which are not so important. My US GPA will be around 3.5-3.6.

At research side, I've participated in Physics research during my undergraduate studies, which involved simulations of some ultra cold systems, thanks to that I've got 3 proceedings and 2 publications in impacted journal, but nothing ""world class"".

So, why I'm asking this is to realistically estimate my probabilities. From browsing sites such as Quora/Reddit I've got perception that my chances for good ML grad school are approximately 0, because I don't have GPA of 3.9+ nor JMLR publication during undergraduate studies nor I'm from TOP25 university. 

So, how viable is my resum, assuming I'm working hard on my GRE and TOEFL?

Thanks!

But such a result can easily be proven for many function classes (polynomial, trigonometric, gaussian, etc.)  as a corollary of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. So why is it that neural networks work well and are so widely used? To be more concise, we can think of the problem of classification as learning a separatrix between high-dimensional manifolds, so why are neural networks a good approximator for such a separatrix? I understand this question may not have a definite answer, but I'm interested to see what you guys think about it and, it'd be great if you could link me to some good research done on this.

At what embedding/state size do you think curse of dimensionality is really a problem ? Are there heuristics with respect to training data size in context of neural networks ?

I'm a PhD student. We just got a new machine with 8 gpus at the department. That's good news, but sadly, nobody thought about what low passions that this could unleash among computer-power-thirsty PhD students. We are like 15 or 20 people.The result has been that the gpus are monopolised by few people, which additionally we don't know who they are, since as we use docker all the processes are run as root. This has led to an atmosphere of accusations and suspiciousness which has darken the mood even more (if possible). I truly fear this will degenerate into an orgy of violence and death as the deadlines come closer :P

Setting jokes aside, I just wanted to ask to who are using shared gpus which system are they using. I have googled a bit and I found TORQUE and kubernetes. I'd like to have some opinion on this if someone is using them. Thank you very much!

The basic idea was to build a dataset of individual cycles of the waveforms produced under all combinations of synth parameters of a bowed string model (e.g. violin, cello..) and learn the conditional and/or latent distribution of the codes that can be used to reproduce the same sound, as well as to estimate the parameters of new input.  Adversarial regularization was used to promote a well-behaved (uniform amd decorrelated) latent space.  The idea was to encourage the latent variables to take on interesting aspects of the variance (e.g. physical dynamics) not represented fully by the known (static) parameters, and ensure as much as possible that they follow a uniform distribution to make for useful ""knobs"".

I discuss some problems encountered in sampling the dynamic latent space of the synthesizer and how I (more or less) overcame these by expanding the dataset in some ways and limiting it in others. The result is a real-time audio synth based on a neural network decoder and wavetable overlap-add synthesis.

Each sensor captures a 100x100 image and there are 5 sensors.  5 sensors x 2 time steps gives me 10 ""channels"".

I know there are more sophisticated ways of handling the temporal dimension, but to start with, I've naively stacked the 10 channels and am feeding them into a single, very vanilla CNN (3 blocks of CNN layers feeding into a FC layer).

I have two questions:

1.  Does it matter if for each sensor I stack the ""before"" and ""after"" values vs., say, the ""before"" and the ""diff"" (i.e., ""after"" - ""before"")?  Would seem that the CNN can arrive at one from the other quite easily through the weights, so it shouldn't matter.  (I don't see a major difference in my few experiments so far.)

2.  There is a spatial relationship between the sensors inputs, but they are measuring very different things.  So, it's interesting when features from two diff. sensors are in the same region of the 100x100 space, but the sensor data is ""shaped"" very differently.  (For instance, RGB channels of animal pictures look very similar when you inspect them individually.  But here, one sensor's input may be large, rounded blobs whereas another's may be fine stripes.)  Is the naive stacking into one CNN a decent fit for this type of input?  Will the CNN filters figure out mostly what to extract?  Or do I need to be looking at something fancier like 3D cross-channel convolution?

Here's what I (questionably) know:

1. Functionally, Autoencoders try to closely recreate their input. For example, training an Autoencoder on MNIST (28x28=784) will produce a new image (28x28=784) that looks at least somewhat similar.

2. I can pass *my own personal handwriting of 0* into the Autoencoder. From there, I could care about one of two possibilites (3 or 4).

3. First possibility: I pass *my* handwriting 0 through the Encoder as a 'Dimension Reduction' tool. I can use the reduced image (5x5=25) as input to a classifier to convert my handwriting digit into Int32.Zero. 

4. Second possibility: I pass *my* handwriting 0 through the Encoder, and when it gets Decoded, it returns the MNIST sample that *my* handwriting is most similar to.

I've recently read the paper for the Q-Prop by S.Gu (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02247) and I've a question about the Critic update.
For a quick summary, the idea here is to combine Stochastic Policy Gradient (like in TRPO) and Deterministic Policy Gradient (like in DDPG) to update our policy. 
In the paper, the algorithm do not use a policy exploration like in DDPG (an off-policy), it is only on policy with the stochastic policy doing the exploration. But the critic is updated like in the DDPG paper, with a exploration policy noted , which is defined no where in their experiments.
Therefore, I'd like to understand what do we need to choose as . Should we use the on-policy (stochastic policy)? Or a normal noise applied on the deterministic policy? Or else?

Thanks in advance!",5,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm part of a startup that is working on an automated dataset generation tool. For example, if you want a dataset of images of orange kittens, our tool will generate the images and send them to you. We're starting out with image datasets but plan to expand to other types later on.

Note: this tool intelligently gathers information from the web, so it'll only work if the item you need a dataset of is something there's publicly-available information on. In other words it won't work for highly domain-specific applications. For example, a dataset of pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S8 will work, but a dataset of screenshots from your app won't.

We have a survey to see if there's any interest in this, you can [fill it out here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8gcJjDxX1BPCCQXKtHJRRdLr4ACODELDF7QIdaT57SsSQg/viewform). It's just six questions :)

Inverse RL solves this task only conditionally, as the agent needs another agent (e.g. human) that performs the task sub-optimally. What has to be done without assuming the presence of a sub-optimal agent is that we make the agent to learn a mapping from (s,a,s') to a reward r (scalar/vector). Here, we assume deterministic mapping and no delayed reward for simplicity. This mapping is learnt by the agent through its experiences via SL, semi-SL, or UL just as in model-based RL, or even via RL. 

Initially, the agent is equipped with a simple, man-made reward function. For example, humans are hard-coded with stimuli such as pain and hunger, which can be considered as factors of the initial reward function. Having learnt the above mapping, adults can associate increase in his bank deposit with a reward. Thus, an agent tries to widen its definition of reward from basic stimuli to abstract concepts such as promotion. I think it is unlikely that humans always perform IRL-like mechanism to learn any reward. I believe that sometimes humans use a method similar to the one I mentioned to learn reward without the presence of sub-optimal agent. 

In fact, the reward function search was done by an evolutionary algorithm in Singh et. al. (2010). I suppose this kind of approach is related to intrinsic motivation and hierarchical RL, but I found it to be somehow different. Is there any recent paper discussing the approach I suggested?

Or 1000? Are the limitations here just resource constraints? Just from reading online it seems there's a drop-off after a certain point, which makes sense because if you assume using a single classifier may vary from the mean from a certain amount, increasing the number of samples would more closely approximate the mean up until you reach a good sample size, if you're doing model averaging. Is there any resource for the number of classifiers used for ensemble methods, especially for segmentation?

From what I've ever seen, it seems like it's only mentioned as a way of keeping information around for a while during a task where a new stream of input may need access to that information. If you are familiar with memory research in psychology and cognitive science, this would seem like a very narrow scope (that's not a criticism of the work or scope, just an observation). I can see why attention is not studied ""directly"" in machine learning, as attention seems meaningless without reference to a task in can be in service of. However, for memory, psychologists sometimes ask what problem it solves in general. For example, what if you need to remember as much as possible. Remembering pixels is too much to store. How do you determine what should be remembered? We remember lots of things that it doesn't seem like we need. Further, how does memory for an image interact with the problem of categorization? Are there papers on a more traditional view of memory in machine learning / AI that I've missed?",2,4,False,self,,,,,

The first source I found about it is from less than month ago, so most people are not aware of this (like me until now). But Keras 1.2 now supports multi GPU with MXNet backend, which seem to be really good news!


Downside is that it works only on Keras 1.2, but one can hope to see it implemented in Keras 2.0!


Questions that arise:

1) Does multi GPU also works with consumer graphic cards like 1070/1080? 
I see no reason why it should not work with consumer cards, but as of now I am not completely sure it does support consumer cards. I think it is a valid question as industrial cards have NVLink which makes multi-GPU usage easier. The link above is running tests on Industrial Cards.

2) Is MXNet as good as Tensorflow or Theano? I personally have no experience with MXNet.

I do intend to answer these questions myself after I have done some more reading. But if someone already can give their inputs, it would be nice!",0,8,False,self,,,,,

 1. If I have a model with 15% error on train set and 14% error on validation set, and another model with 5% error on train set and 13% error on validation set, I understood it is generally better to pick the first model (note that 13% vs 14% is small but not negligible). Why is that? If the validation set results are better, why would I care about the train set?
 
 2.  I know of several methods to reduce overfitting
* lower tree depth 
* high value in the regulation parameter
* optimize parametrs on the validation set (and not the test set)
* keep the train score just a little better than the test score (as in my first question) 

   do all these methods relate to the same type of ""overfitting"", in what sense optimizing parameters on the validation set and having a high regulation parameter are both referring to the same ""overfitting"" concept?

 3. [in this  photo][1] (taken from [here][2])
it is explained that for eta=0.1 (eta in this case is the learning rate in XGBOOST) the model is underfitting, and for eta=0.9 the model is overfitting. I can see how for eta=0.9 the model is overfitting (as the test error goes up) but for me it seems that also for eta=0.1 the model is overfitting - as the test error goes a little up while the train error goes down. What am I missing?

  [2]: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/168666/boosting-why-is-the-learning-rate-called-a-regularization-parameter ""here""

 5. Lets say I have 2 tree models. One has tree_depth=4 and 10% error, and the other has tree_depth=7 and 9.7% error (so clearly the first model has lower complexity than the latter, but the second model is a better by a small but not negligible amount). I read it is recommended to pick the first model over the latter, but why is that? Is it because the first model is probably less complex/overfitted? And if so, then why would I care if the complexity reduces error? Is it maybe because the first model would probably have less variance when introduced to unseen datasets?

https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1001-neural-network-ensembles-cross-validation-and-active-learning.pdf

I also made a blog post on it since I found it so interesting, describing what it means and it's role in ensemble learning.

http://www.jungle-ml.com/2017/09/10/ambiguity-bias-variance-decomposition-understanding-randomized-ensemble-methods/

Around the end of my blog post, I state the following:

""So, essentially, we want to maximize the variance of the estimators about their ensemble in order to minimize the variance of our ensemble with regards to its fitting against data.""

Am I understanding it correctly? This would mean increasing the spread or rather making each estimator as different as possible around its total mean (increasing variance) results in an overall reduction in generalization error for the ensemble. I see the paradigm of bias-variance tradeoff in the sense if the estimators were all very similar, that increases 'bias'? 

Would this imply that for decreasing error, decision trees in a random forest should ideally disagree with each other as much as possible?

Also, has there been work done to maximize this 'disagreement' between the estimators in an ensemble. 

Perhaps generate estimators such that they are not only randomized (eg. bagging), but very different from one another as well.

I am now trying to first use Kaggle Data Science Bowl open dataset for my model testing. I intend to use a fully unsupervised approach from input CT images to cancer label. However, the model usually learns nothing without underfitting to all negative samples.

After that, I planned to supervise attention maps first based on nodule labels which hand build the ground-truth attention maps from normalized Gaussian distribution. But, it was still underfitting, which all the samples give the same solution.

I have tried using different learning rate, loss function et cetera but none of them helped. I have heard that a good initialization is a key to the success. But since the CT images are three dimensional (stacked images), it simply cannot use any pre-trained model on that.

The proposed model is to use a 3D FPN (feature pyramid network) network to output a feature layer and an attention map which both with the same resolution from the input data (48x48x48x48, the last dimension represents different patch, cropped by standard step size) from the same last convolutional layer.

I am wondering whether they are some more proper way to train a good attention maps? Or do I miss something important? Any advise will be appreciated.

While reading the paper on BEGAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10717.pdf), a question came to my mind.

How can we be sure that such Generative Networks don't memorize some examples of the training, and then ""simply"" learn the mapping from the noise to N examples of the training?


When the Generative Network complexity is high enough, N (numbers of training samples learned) can be large and thus give a misleading impression of diversity. On top of that, the *reconstruction error* (since examples are not perfectly memorized) of the generator adds to the effect/impression of ""generated from scratch"" examples. Is it something the active researchers community is taking care of?


The reason I am asking is that I was wondering if a very simple *nearest neighbors* approach would work? Where one would show the top-5 NN in the training set for each generated examples. It would somehow ensure that this doesn't occur and be beneficial for such papers.


Now I see some reasons why this might not be done/does not appear:

1. The metric of nearest neighbors is not so straightforward or tractable (because of the dimensionality). But it would be done if we found some meaningful metric, to ensure the generator doesn't enter in this ""mode"".

2. This is done as sort of a sanity check but not documented in such papers because obvious.

3. There is something in the architecture that I misunderstood, preventing such a mode to occur.

4. Showing empirically the ""space continuity"" (as in 4.3 of the aforementioned paper) is a sufficient evidence that the model generalizes and does not memorize.


Thank you in advance for the clarifications, I hope this question won't be too naive for this sub.

I'm training a pretty simple regression neural network with ~160 features and 200.000 training examples (of which I'm using 20.000 for testing). In order to find the best performing network, I'm training it with many different randomly selected hyper parameters.

While deep and wide architectures obviously overfit extremely, they also yield slighty better test performance than other architectures. For example, a network with 4 hidden layers with 800, 960, 1150 and 1380 units respectively results in a mean squared error of 3.28 while an architecture with only 2 hidden layers and 300/210 units results in a MSE of 3.32.

How can this be explained? I don't feel like using an overfitted network is sensible, however it does show better test performance than less overfitted networks. I already tried adding dropout layers and using L2 regularization and while both reduce overfitting, both the training and test loss are higher.

It seems like every intern position in machine learning is limited to people with masters or PhD positions. Is there any way for an undergraduate to really bag a position for ML?

I am trying to train a basic cgan for MNIST based on labels (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) in keras. I am concatenating the noise and condition at the input for the generator. For the discriminator I concatenate the condition after applying 3 consecutive convolutions to the input image (so that the image structure can be interpreted without destroying it by adding conditions right away). The condition is then also fed to a dense layer before adding it to the sigmoid output. The network seems to learn upto 200 iterations where it generates more or less number-like structures but then later starts to just destroy what it has learnt and generates big white blobs covering the whole image. (number pixes are white and background black). What could possibly be wrong? below are my G and D networks. I am using SGD optimizer with lr 0.0005, momentum 0.9 for both G and D. Any ideas?

This is good because everything is differentiable but also bad because the computation cost grows with the amount of available memory.

Since these nets don't just read from but also write to the memory, why don't you use a virtual view of the memory which depends on the time step? For instance, you could define 8 (partially overlapping, why not?) views of the memory and cycle through them in a round-robin fashion.

Maybe you could associate a (learned?) id vector with each view and send that vector to the net so that it knows which view is active.

Do you think the net would learn to work in such a setting and make good use of all the available memory?

---

edit:

What I'm suggesting is still soft attention. The net doesn't control the views but should learn to exploit them (like a moving platform in a game) and the net uses soft attention to read and write within the views.

There's no hard action. That's the whole point of my suggestion.",6,4,False,self,,,,,

I work on a project where I want to classify sensor data that was recorded. I have multiple time series where each sample consists of &gt;60 dimensions, one for each sensor.

I don't use more preprocessing than performing a z-transformation for each sensor and cutting non relevant intervals. For classifying, I train each sample as an individual data point (I know this is probably not the best way when you have a time-series, but I'm still learning). 

For classification I used kNN, SVM and MLP. They all gave me accuracy results of 60-70%. I used 5 fold cross-validation and averaged the results. Now after some research, I found random forest and though I would give it a try. Again used 5 fold cv and I got results of 100% accuracy, seldom 98%. I still cant believe that this is true, so I thought it might be the data. Because I used every sample as individual point, data points are really near to their next neighbors (sensor frequency is 150Hz). That's why a random chosen training and test set yield accuracy of 90-100% for all models. So I used cross-validation to be sure that there a blocks of data unseen by the model. Now I think there might be also such a problem for the random forest method. I know people say it might be the best classifier for structured data, but still I can't believe it scores 100% almost all the time. 

This is where I need help: How can I design my test and train set to verify this result? What should I test to see it really learns to classify the input? ",8,2,False,self,,,,,

If you're trying to get an ML startup off the ground, you should know how investors like talking about it. 

Below is a blog post I wrote to summarize how I learned to talk about data while raising a $1M seed round for my startup. I'd love to get everyone's feedback on it!

~~~~

**Data is like a Moat! and Other Bad Ways to Talk About Data and AI**

If youre founding, funding, or fueling a startup, you need to know how to talk about data.
Almost 50 years in to the Information Age and we still lack great ways to talk about data and its value. Newly arrived 3rd wave AI is hungry for data in a way that 1st and 2nd wave AI never were. A fresh influx of capital is fueling work and attention around AI again. But in some ways, these new companies and projects make it ever harder to talk about data.
Our language about data is sprinting away from us. We look back on phrases like horseless carriage or talking telegraph and wonder how people could have used such backwards language when a future tech arrived.

But were doing the same thing today in how we talk about data. Heres how Ive heard a lot of investors, creators, and other founders talk about data . By understanding the history and limits of these analogies, you can be one step ahead of everyone in understanding the impact of data and AI on business.

There are 4 main analogies that people are using to communicate the valuable role that data plays in business; especially in AI-centric projects:

* Data network effects
 
* Data moats
 
* Systems of Intelligence
 
* AI Flywheels  my favorite!

Heres how I understand each of these analogies with my team at Dopamine Labs.

**Data Network Effect**

A Data Network Effect is a property of a product that improves with the more data it has available, due to emergent relationships between segments of the data. Its an analogy to Metcalfes Law as it played out in telephone networks and the later Social Network Effects that explain the defensibility and the growth of businesses like Facebook. Like a social or telephone network, only some small fraction of the data in a data network is useful to any specific customer or task (there are  at most  only 500 people I care about on Facebook of my thousand-odd connections). In a product experiencing a data network effect, as the total amount of data available to a learning system grows, you can provide more value to any individual user even though they only interact personally with a different small sliver of the data network. Another nice thing about this analogy is that, like in a communications network, every member of the network generates value for the network simply by participating in it.

*So if youre designing an AI-powered product, how might you store, collect, analyze, and act upon your data such that your models and product appreciate with more data?*

**Data Moat**

A Data Moat describes a competitive advantage a business holds because of its proprietary data set. Its a modern extension of traditional moats of business, such as vendor lock-in, branding, trade secrets, efficiencies of scale, and regulatory capture. Like their literal counterpart, the metaphorical data moat protects an earned market position from potential followers. Warren Buffett described the importance of moats in his investment theses: In business I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats. Like these other defensibility moats, a strong data moat inhibits competitors from stealing marketshare.
To build a strong data moat, your data set must be, amongst other things, large, unable to be synthesized or statistically replicated from first principles, and difficult to acquire due to access barriers. (For example, Dopamines Persuasion AI benefits from our many relationships with many different customers. A CV-based Cancer-Detection AI benefits from exclusivity and patient data privacy laws. An ultrasonic oilfield surveying AI benefits from land rights and cost barriers. A fraud detecting AI benefits from a regulatory environment that keeps transactions private.)

As a counterexample, a CV-based scene parsing system, which can train using freely and widely available natural image data, might struggle to build a data moat. Since theres no protection to that data source, anyone can train a model on it. That means no one model could be expected to drastically outperform another based on data alone.

*So if youre designing an AI-powered product, what sort of proprietary data set might you incorporate into your core value proposition as to create a defensible data moat?*

**System of Intelligence (SoI)**

SoI is an analogy that Jerry Chen at Greylock Partners makes to the traditional Systems of Record (SoR) that businesses use, brought into a more contemporary age. SoRs capture value by placing themselves between the customer and their data. For example, theyre the SaaS that a business might use for managing data about its customers, employees, IT infrastructure, and finances. Its the Salesforces, Workdays, Oracles, and Atlasssians. If a customer cant access their data without continuing to pay for your software/service, youre in a very strong position.

Analogously, Systems of Intelligence capture value by putting themselves between their customer and the value generated by their data.

This analogy is a good description of a business model, and that makes it useful for telling data driven businesses apart from a data driven toys.

*If youre building an AI-powered tool and your customer doesnt know what to do with their data without your System of Intelligence (that has also been trained on lots of other peoples data  see Data Network Effect), thats a wicked strong position to be in.*

**Data/AI Flywheel**

A Data/AI Flywheel is an analogy we like from Bradford Cross at DCVC. Its akin to Jim Collins business value flywheel. Collins analogy is one is my favorites because it explains how businesses grow and become defensible. It explains how, in a well-aligned business, value generated in one part of the business fuels the growth of value in another part of the business.

[How data creates value in a data flywheel.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KdoG8uVkPPvi4-3xnQYDMw.png)

Crosss AI-specific analogy of the Data Flywheel explores how the role that humans have previously played in creating value in business processes is being replaced by AIs.

This analogy also provides a way to think about even very young AI-powered companies. You can evaluate them based on the existence or strength of each linkage in the Flywheel: does this better solution to a customer need expand data collection? Does the increase in data from a new customer improve the core model? Does a better model deliver better value?

*If youre designing an AI-powered product, how might your data and business processes cooperate to create an AI-Flywheel?*

I wish I could tell you that theres a right way to talk about data, but there isnt. We use analogies to talk about things we dont understand, and we dont understand how data and AI will impact business yet.

Eventually, well get to stop making these analogies. we will have a organic diction (lexicon) of data . . . but by then, the next generation of great tech companies will be established.
For people living and working at the leading edge, bad analogies are just like water.

It's easy enough to come up with some heuristics to prevent exploring these options in the beam. Forbidding it from using any trigram more than once seems to work pretty well. Now that I'm writing up a paper about my model though I need some justifiable heuristics instead of my ad-hoc ones. 

Are these problems that I'm observing well-known? Does anyone have a reference for some commonly applied beam search heuristic constraints?",4,19,False,self,,,,,

I've had an ongoing project for a few months now, and I'm getting rather close.  The issue that I currently have is that I can't cross over two genomes without having explosive complexity from it.  I read in the MIT papers for NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) that the genomes are to evolve incrementally, however, I'm having an incredibly difficult time with it.  I feel like part of it would be from giving the child the maximum amount of neurons between both parents, but in SethBling's other code ( https://repl.it/JHik/1 ), it seems to work just fine.  I directly replicated his code for crossing over into my own program but it seems to just over-complexify the population.

If there are any Python programmers out there, my code can be seen at the following link:
https://repl.it/LCPn/17

The crossover function can be seen on line 365.  Currently, it is replaced by simply copying one parent's genome.  There's code commented out for my attempt at crossing genomes over.

Also, upon executing the code, it will display all of the genomes in this manner:

fitness ~ len(links) ~ len(neurons)

... followed by a diagram of all species (with some data) and all genomes.

Any help at all is appreciated.  Thank you!",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I am now trying to build far more advanced LSTMs, but am having trouble figuring out how to correctly batch the specific data I am using.

My dataset consists of temporal financial data. Each row of the dataset contains an ID number, a timestamp, ~100 features as real numbers and the labelled output value as a real number too. I am attempting to pass in all of these features (~100 real number inputs per time step) for each ID in order of their timestamps as a sequence into my LSTM and hence make a prediction of the labelled value at each timestamp. The biggest issue I am having is that each ID doesn't exist across all timestamps of the data set.

There are ~1800 timestamps and ~1400 IDs. My initial thought was to batch the data as a sliding window, similar to the diagram shown the in ""Variables and placeholders"" section of [this blog](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/hello-world-rnn-83cd7105b767).

[Here is an example of the structure of my dataset and the first 5 batches I would create from it.](https://imgur.com/a/vvVCE)

The blue box shows each batch, the red indicates that this ID does not exist at this timestep (no data), and the green indicates that it does.

In this diagram, I am taking batches of 5 IDs over sequences of 3 timestamps. These 5 sequences would be processed through my NN and the total loss over the 5 sequences would then be calculated and thus the optimization applied. Of course, in reality I would actually be taking more IDs and longer sequences in each batch.

Clearly, at the earlier and later timestamps, there is a lot of missing data. How can I best work around this? Can I just pad the input sequences with 0s and set the labels as 0 too, or would this influence the backpropagation and optimization of my NN?

If padding with 0s is not the correct way around this, what is a better way to batch my data and feed it into the NN?",9,5,False,self,,,,,

*****

### Disregard for the rules

It appears like there are many people posting here that haven't even read the rules - this is of course particularly obvious when looking at posts without appropriate Tag (this rule was in part made to verify that people read the rules).

I think this is also a reason why the quality of posts in general declines... Bad posts encourage other people to make bad posts as well, and people who spend their time downvoting and reporting posts grow tired of this subreddit and go elsewhere, so I'd advocate more (at the very least automatic) moderation.

The same bot that applies the tag could just delete the post if there isn't any, the author could then post again *after* having read the rules - *if the post still seems appropriate*.


### ""What should I do with my life?"" posts

Of course we all understand that machine learning is super exciting and the more people throw their brains at it the better, but we shouldn't have to read everyone's life story and try to give personalized advice on how to proceed to become a ""machine learning person"".

We can't speak on behalf of universities or companies and we can't assess whether machine learning would be a good career path for someone we don't know.

If a question like this is not answered in the FAQ people should ask themselves whether it should be answered in the FAQ - if not, I believe the post would probably be useless to most readers of this subreddit and should maybe not be posted in the first place.


### WAYR

I personally think WAYR was pretty great and I don't understand why it's not stickied every week automatically.

The discussion mainly went in the direction of asking what are alternatives to backprop. In this discussion I would like us to answer the question: what are the problems of backprop? Indeed, the article didn't really answer this question, only refering shortly to the difficulties of unsupervised learning.

Here's my initial input:  
Problems that seem to be intrinsic to backprop :  

* Continuous learning problems (backprop forgets previous knowledge)
* Modularity (backprop uses all available connections automatically) (_edit: not very clear, could be removed_)
* Robustness to specific noise (adversarial examples)

Problems that currently pose lots of difficulties and we're not sure are possible with backprop:  

* Learning reasoning/planning
* Unsupervised learning

I am quite new to machine learning so please excuse any mistakes from my part. I have two datasets containing KPIs regarding the performance of two athletes. Each dataset contains 40 variables both qualitative and quantitative with around 900 records of data. The variables are not independent in general. 

My goal is to find meaningful differences between the datasets in order to explain why an athlete performs better than the other and in which KPIs or combination of KPIs he does so. So far I was able to do so by visually comparing graphs which is a time consuming procedure. I would like to automate and possibly improve this procedure by using machine learning algorithms. My initial thought was to use some kind of a clustering algorithm. 

I would be grateful if someone could propose to me a methodology to follow or point me in the correct direction.

Thank you in advance!",9,1,False,self,,,,,

I was curious to find out if a neural net could learn how to solve a cube in the most ""efficient"" way, by solving the cube in less than 20 moves, i.e [god's number](http://www.cube20.org/).

This is a very naive solution, to start as a proof of concept. I used a 2 layer neural net: 1 convnet layer and 1 feedforward layer. The input is the state of the cube to be solved. The output is the next predicted move until solved. For the training set, I generated games at random during training for games of 10 moves or less from solved with the corresponding solutions as label. At each step of the solution, I made the network make a guess for its next move and used SGD for training. I trained this over many epochs until the loss was relatively steady.

Surprisingly, the network works decently well for any position less than 6 moves away from solved. I found that by shuffling up to 6 moves, sometimes more, it is able to correctly solve it. It doesn't always work and can definitely use improvement, but its a good place to start.

[Here's a video of it](https://youtu.be/QLUca-x2ZVo) in action. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/jerpint/rubiks_cube_convnet), just follow the instructions to shuffle the cube yourself and solve it with the network.

There is plenty of exploring to do! Bigger networks might be one solution, fancier networks would likely be more appropriate. I thought of reinforcement learning, but decided to use the simpler supervised-learning approach to begin.

DISCLAIMER: The search-space for a properly mixed cube is HUGE (something like 4e19 iirc). The original thought was that a ConvNet might be able to solve such a space. I do think that a more sophisticated approach would be necessary to solve from more than 10 moves.  Maybe an idea would be to 'introduce' the cube to known algorithms and let it learn to optimise based on those. Also a reward system reinforcement approach could be a good idea.",27,21,False,self,,,,,

# 1. Introduction

This is the story of us writing a machine learning framework for our high school thesis, of what we learned and how we went about writing one from scratch. The story starts about 3 years ago: we saw a video of [MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44), a Super Mario AI that could learn to play Super Mario levels. We thought that was about the coolest thing of all time and wanted to do something at least kind of similar for our high school thesis. 

&amp;nbsp;
## 1.1 The Original Plan

Fast forward, over 2 years ago we asked for help in deciding what kind of machine learning project we could feasibly do for our senior year high school thesis (see [original thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3jn5xf/question_what_interesting_machine_learning/)). Quite ambitiously, we proposed a time investment of about 1000 hours total (as in 500 hours each over the course of 8 months)  for what project, we didnt know yet. In that thread, we were generously met with a lot of help, advice ranged from reproducing existing papers to implementing specific things to getting to understand the material and then seeing what peaked our interest. After some consideration, we figured we would implement something along the lines of DeepMinds arcade game AI and then make it more general, figuring that would be easy for some reason. When planning our project in more detail we however quickly realised that 

1. we had no idea what we were doing and 
2. it would be a shame to do all that work from scratch and have it be so arbitrarily specific. 

&amp;nbsp;
## 1.2 Pivoting

Before doing anything very productive, we had to properly study machine learning. We figured this might take a while and allocated that part of our time to writing the theoretical part of our thesis, which conveniently overlapped. But because around that time we had to hand in an official target definition for our thesis, we set the most generic goals we could get away with. For reference, for a concerning number of months our project was officially named Software framework for diverse machine learning tasks with an even longer and even less specific subtitle. During further study and first attempts to draft the actual target definition for our project, our plans gradually shifted from a machine learning framework for playing specific types of games pivoted to an any kind of visual input learning framework and then finally to an anything machine learning framework  because why not, it seemed like an interesting challenge and we were curious to see how far we would get.

&amp;nbsp;

---
&amp;nbsp;
# 2. Research and Planning

Alright, so we've decided to write a machine learning framework. How does one create a machine learning framework? It takes many weeks to get reasonably proficient in just using a given framework, and that with proper guides, video tutorials and forums to ask for help. Creating a machine learning framework is a whole other story, with no 12 step guidelines to follow. For a considerable amount of time, we were at a loss at what we actually needed to implement  constantly encountering new and conflicting terms, definitions and not-so-obvious-but the actual conclusion is obvious-articles. After a little over a month we slowly got a very basic grasp of how this whole machine learning thing worked  something with functions that are approximated at certain points in steps typically using differentiation to make some metric go down  still magic, but a bit less so (until we read about CNNs, LSTMs and then GANs, each of which confused the heck out of us for some time). 

&amp;nbsp;
## 2.1 Sketching our Framework

As soon as we knew a bit about the art of machine learning we got more serious about the writing a new framework part. Because there are no guides for that, we resorted to reading the source code of established frameworks  all to us relevant parts, many times, until it made some sense. In the meantime, we had decided to use C# as our primary language  mostly because we were already very familiar with it and didnt want to also have to learn a new language, but officially also because there were no other proper neural network frameworks for .NET. Alongside reading the source code of machine learning libraries (mainly Deeplearning4J, Brainstorm and Tensorflow) we sketched out how we wanted our own framework to be used. After some time, we felt like there was some unnecessary confusion in getting to know machine learning frameworks as an outsider and we set out to design our API to avoid that. Note that because our design makes sense to us doesnt mean that it makes more sense than the existing ones to other people, nor do we recommend everyone wishing to use machine learning to write their own framework, just to spare their own sanity.  

Our nave ideas on how a machine learning should look like was clearly inspired by our C#/Java based programming experience, as is evident from the code example we drafted a few weeks in:

    Sigma sigma = Sigma.Create(""minsttest"");
    GUIMonitor gui = (GUIMonitor) sigma.AddMonitor(new GUIMonitor(""Sigma GUI Demo""));
    gui.AddTabs({""Overview"", ""Data"", ""Tests""});
    
    sigma.Prepare();
    
    DataSetSource inputSource = new MultiDataSetSource(new FileSource(""mnist.inputs""), new CompressedFileSource(new FileSource(""mnist.inputs.tar.gz""), new URLSource(""http://....url...../mnist.inputs.targ.gz"")));
    DataSetSource targetSource = new MultiDataSetSource(new FileSource(""mnist.targets""), new CompressedFileSource(new FileSource(""mnist.targets.tar.gz""), new URLSource(""http://....url...../mnist.targets.targ.gz"" [, output: ""otherthandefault""]) [, compression: new TarGZUnpacker(), output: ""mnist.inputs"" , forceUpdate: false]));
    DataSet data = new DataSet(new ImageRecordReader(inputSource, {28, 28}).Extractor({ALL} =&gt; {inputs: {Extractor.BatchSize, 1, 28, 28}}).Preprocess(Normalisor()), new StringRecordReader(targetSource).Extractor({0} =&gt; {targets: {Extractor.BatchSize, 1}} [, blockSize: auto/all/1024^3]);
    
    Network network = new Network(""mynetwork"");
    network.Architecture = Input(inputShape: {28, 28}) + 2 * FullyConnected(size: 1024) + SoftmaxCE() + Loss();
    
    Trainer trainer = sigma.CreateTrainer(""mytrainer"");
    trainer.SetNetwork(network);
    trainer.SetInitialiser(new GaussianInitialiser(mean: 0.0, standardDeviation: 0.05));
    trainer.SetTrainingDataIterator(MinibatchIterator(batchSize: 50, data[""inputs""], data[""targets""]);
    trainer.SetOptimiser(new SGDOptimiser(learningRate: 0.01);
    trainer.AddActiveHook(EarlyStopper(patience: 3));
    trainer.AddActiveHook(StopAfterEpoch(epoch: 2000));
    
    gui.AccentColor[""trainer1""] = Colors.DeepOrange;
    gui.tabs[""overview""].AddSubWindow(new LineChartWindow(name: ""Error"", sources: {""*&lt;Trainer&gt;.Training.Error""}) [, x: 1, y: 0, width: 2, height: 1]);
    gui.tabs[""overview""].AddSubWindow(new LineChartWindow(name: ""Accuracy"", sources: {""*&lt;Trainer&gt;.Training.Accuracy""}));
    
    sigma.Run();
    
And skipping ahead a bit, it should be noted that the final framework is extremely similar to what we envisioned here: merely changing around a few syntax things and names, the above example from about a year ago can be used 1:1 in our current framework. The jury is still out on whether thats a sign of really good or really bad design. Also note the python-style kwargs notation for layer constructor arguments, which was soon discarded in favour of something that actually compiles in C#. But back to the timeline.

&amp;nbsp;
## 2.2 The Sigma Architecture

After defining the code examples and sketching out the rough parts we felt a machine learning framework needed, we arrived at this general architecture for Sigma.Core, divided into core components (which translate almost 1:1 to namespace in our project):

* **Util**: Mostly boring, well, utility stuff, but also registries, a key part of our architecture. Because we wanted to be able to inspect and visualise everything we needed a global way to access things by identifier  a registry. Our registry is essentially a dictionary with a string key which may contain more registries. Nested registries can be resolved using registry resolvers in dot notation with some fancy wildcards and tags in angel brackets (e.g. network.layers.*&lt;fullyconnected&gt;.weights). 
* **Data**:	Datasets, the records that make them up in various formats, the pipeline to load, extract, prepare and cache them from disk, web, or wherever they come from and make them available as blocks. These blocks are parts of an extracted dataset, consist of many individual records, and are used to avoid loading all of a potentially very large dataset into memory at once. Also, data iterators, which slices larger blocks from datasets into pieces that are then fed to the model. 
* **Architecture**: Abstract definitions for machine learning models, consisting of layer constructs, which are lightweight placeholder layers defining what a layer will look like before its fully instantiated. These layers may be in any order and connected with however many other layers they would like. 
* **Layers**: Unfortunately named since we started out with just neural networks, but these are the individual layers of our machine learning networks  they store meta-parameters (e.g. size) and actual trainable parameters (e.g. the actual weights).
* **Math**:  Everything that has directly to do with math and low-level computations. All the automatic differentiation logic (which is very much required for doing proper machine learning) and everything that modifies our data is processed here in various backends (e.g. distributed CPU / GPU). To support calculating derivatives with respect to anything we opted for an approach with symbolic objects  essentially an object for a number or an array where the actual data was hidden (it can be fetched, but only via copies). These symbolic objects are passed around through a handler which does the actual data modification. This abstraction proved to be useful when implementing CUDA support where, due to the asynchronous execution of the CUDA stream, the raw data could not exposed to the user anyway, at least not without major performance hits (host-device synchronisation is very slow). 
* **Training**: The largest component with many subcomponents, all revolving around the actual training process. A training process is defined in a trainer, which specifies the following: 
  * **Initialisers**, that define how a models parameters are initialised, which can be configured with registry identifiers. For example, trainer.addInitialiser(layers.*.biases, new GaussianInitialiser(0.1, 0.0)); would initialise all parameters named biases with a Gaussian distribution of 0.1 (mean 0). 
  * **Modifiers**, that would modify parameters at runtime, for example to clip weights to a certain range. 
  * **Optimisers**, that define how a model learns (e.g. gradient descent). Because we mainly considered neural networks we only implemented gradient based optimisers, but the interface theoretically supports any kind of optimisation. 
  * **Hooks**, that hook into the training process at certain time steps and can do whatever you want (e.g. update visualisations, store / restore checkpoints, compute and log metrics, do something (e.g. stop) when some criteria are satisfied). 
  * **Operators**, that delegate work to workers which execute it with a certain backend computation handler according to some parameters. Notable is our differentiation of global and local processing, where global is the most recent global state. This global state is fetched by local workers that then do the actual work, publish their results to the operator which merges it back into the global scope. A global timestep event is only ejected when all local workers have submitted their work for that timestep, enabling more fine control in distributed learning, at least in theory. 
* **Sigma**: The root namespace that can create Sigma environments and trainers. An environment may contain multiple trainers, which are all run and, if specified, visualised simultaneously (which was supposed to be helpful in hyperparameter search). 
* **Monitors**: Technically outside of the core project, but still a component. These monitors can be attached to a Sigma environment and can then, well, monitor almost everything about the trainers of that environment using the aforementioned registry entries. Behaviour can be injected using commands, a special form of hooks that are only invoked once. This way monitors can be used almost independently of the core Sigma project and can be pretty much anything, like a graphical interface or a live, locally hosted website.

# 3. Implementation

And thats what we implemented, step by step. We started out with me mainly working on Sigma.Core and my partner on our visualisation interface, working to a common interface for months until we could finally combine our individual parts and have it miraculously work in a live graphical interface. The specifics of implementation were very interesting and quite challenging to us, but most of the particulars are probably rather dull to read  after all, most of the time things didnt work and when we fixed something, we moved on to the next something that didnt.  

&amp;nbsp;
## 3.1 Low-level Data and Mathematical Processing

The very first thing we did was getting the data ETL (extract transform load) pipeline up and running, mainly fetching data from a variety of sources, loading them into a dataset and extracting them as blocks. I then focused on the mathematical processing part  everything that had to do with using math and calculating derivatives in our framework. I based our functional automatic differentiation, aptly named SigmaDiff, on an F# library for autodiff named DiffSharp, which I modified heavily to support n-dimensional arrays, improve performance significantly, fix a few bugs, support multiple simultaneous non-global backends, variable data types, and some more stuff that Im forgetting. The specific details of getting that to work arent very interesting  a lot of glue code, refactoring and late-night bug-chasing because the backpropagation didnt work as it should with some specific combination of operations. One memorable bug was that when remapping backend operations to my own OpenBLAS-based backend I forgot that matrix transposition did more than just change its shape  a mistake that cost me weeks in debugging efforts down the line, because things just didnt work properly with large layers or more than 1 record per minibatch (duh). 

&amp;nbsp;
## 3.2 Performance Optimisations

Compared to all the backend work, the middleware of layers and optimisers was rather trivial to implement, as there are hundreds of tutorials and papers on how to create certain layers and optimisers, where I only had to map them to our own solution. Really, that part should have taken a few weeks at most, but took that much longer because we only then discovered dozens of bugs and stability issues. Skipping over a lot of uninteresting details here, it should be noted that at this point performance of the framework was quite bad. Im talking 300ms/iteration of 100 MNIST records with just a few dense layers on a high-end computer bad. This bad performance not only slowed training but also actual development down by quite a lot, hiding a few critical bugs and never letting us test the entire framework in a real-world use case within a reasonable time. You might wonder why we didnt just fix the performance from the get-go, but we wanted to make the actual training work first so we would have something to show for our thesis. In hindsight not the ideal choice, but it still worked out quite well and otherwise we wouldnt have been able to demonstrate our project adequately in time for the final presentation. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.2.1 A Self-Adjusting Buffer

It took many months before we finally got around to addressing the performance issues, but there was no single fix in sight, rather a collection of hundreds of small to medium sized improvements. A major issue was the way our SigmaDiff math processor handled operations: for every operation, a copy was created for the resulting data. That added up. The copying was necessary because backwards differentiation requires all intermediate values, so we couldnt just not copy things. We couldnt even create all required buffers in a static way ahead of time because there was (and still is) no way to traverse the operations that will be executed  the computation graph is constructed anew every time, and we cant completely rely on them to remain constant. To introduce a reliable way of buffering anyway, we introduced the concept of sessions: A session was meant to be a set of operations that would be repeated many times. Iterations, essentially. When a session is started we would start storing all created arrays in our own store and when an array of the same dimensions was requested in the next session we could return the one from last session, all without allocating any new memory. If more memory was required than last time, we could still allocate it, if less was used, we could discard it for the next session, rendering this neatly self-adjusting. To not overwrite data that was created within a session but was needed for the next one (e.g. parameters) we added an explicit limbo buffer, which was basically just a flag that could be set at runtime for a certain array that marked it as do not reuse. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.2.2 SIMD and Avoiding Intermediate Allocation

Other significant performance improvements were adding SIMD instructions (which enables processing of typically 8 values at the same time for CPU-bound arithmetic operations) wherever possible and reducing other memory allocation to a minimum by adding some in-place operations wherever intermediate values weren't strictly needed. For example, copying results when accumulating gradients during backpropoagation on nodes with multiple operands is unnecessary because the intermediate values aren't used. By analysing profilers to death, I eventually got the iteration time for my MNIST sample down to an acceptable 18ms in release configuration (speedup of about 17x). Incidentally, the core was now so fast that our visualiser sometimes crashed because it couldnt keep up with all the incoming data. 

## 3.3 Monitoring with Sigma

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.3.1 The monitoring System

When developing Sigma, we not only focused on the mathematical backend but also implemented a feature rich monitoring system which allows any application to be built on top of Sigma (or better said Sigma.Core). Every parameter can be observed, every change hooked, every parameter managed. With this monitoring system, we built a monitor (i.e. application) that can be used to learn Sigma and machine learning in general. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.3.2 The WPF Monitor

Users should be able to not only use Sigma, but also **learn** with Sigma. To address this issue, we built a feature-rich application (with WPF) that allows users to interact with Sigma. plot learning graphs, manage parameters and control the AI like controlling a music player. This monitor, as every other component of Sigma, is fully customisable and extensible. All components were designed with reusability in mind, which allows users to build their own complex application on top of the default monitor. But why describe a graphical user interface? See it for yourself, here is the UI (and Sigma) in action. (Example builds of Sigma can be downloaded on GitHub).

## 3.4 CUDA Support and Finishing Touches


Only 2 months ago we started finalising and polishing our framework: adding CUDA support, fixing many stability issues and rounding off a few rough spots that annoyed us. The CUDA support part was particularly tricky as I could only use CuBLAS, not CuDNN, because our backend doesnt, by design, understand individual layers but just raw computation graphs. A problematic side effect of the previously described session-logic was that there was no guarantee when buffers would be freed, as that was the job of the indeterministic GC. To not leak CUDA device memory I added my own bare-bones reference counter to the device memory allocator, which would be updated when buffers were created / finalised, which works surprisingly well. With CuBLAS, many custom optimised kernels and many nights of my time we achieved around 5ms/iteration for the same sample on a single GTX 1080, which we deemed acceptable for our envisioned use cases.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
# 4. Conclusion

Approximately 3000 combined hours, tens of thousands of lines of code and many long nights later we are proud to finally present something we deem reasonably usable for what it is: [Sigma](https://github.com/ThinkingTransistor/Sigma), a machine learning framework that might help you understand a little bit more about machine learning. As of now, we probably wont be adding many new features to Sigma, mainly because were working on a new project related to it thats now taking up most of our available time. Even though it lacks a lot of default features (most importantly the host of default layer types other frameworks offer), were quite happy with how far we got with our project and hope that its an adequate update to our original question 2 years ago. We would be happy if some of you could check it out and give us some feedback. 

&amp;nbsp;

## 4.1 The Cost of Creating a Machine Learning Framework 

Excluding time, its quite cheap. Honestly, with some solid prior programming experience (so that the low-level programming part doesn't become an issue), the whole thing isn't terribly difficult and is probably something most people could do, given enough time. A lot of time. Overall, we it took us approximately: 

1. Some 600 hours of research
2. Some 2400 hours of development
3. 2 tortured souls, preferably sold to the devil in exchange for less bugs

We have long since stopped properly counting, so take these numbers with a grain of salt, but they should be in the right ballpark. 

&amp;nbsp;
  
## 4.2 Final remarks 
All in all, an undertaking like this is extremely time intensive. It was very much overkill for a high school thesis from the get-go, and we knew that, but it just kept getting more and more elaborate, essentially taking up all of our available time and then some. It was definitely worth it though, for now we have a solid understanding how things work on a lower level and, most importantly, we can say weve actually written a machine learning framework, which grants us additional bragging rights :)

I work in manufacturing and have recently taken an interest in machine learning and all the cool things you can do with it. I have an idea for a potential use at my job but would need input to see if it makes sense at all! 

So basically, I have been trying to come up with better ways to predict how many workers my company would require at any given time for the next month or so. This would allow us to avoid scheduling conflicts and *foresee* any instances where we would need to call in workers for overtime to continue running at maximal efficiency, or approve more PTO if workers are not needed.

Some background on the manufacturing:

Our company manufactures chemicals and we run multiple batches (as opposed to a continuous line of production) of different products at any given time on many pieces of equipment. To start a process, Chemical A will need to be sucked into a Reactor A using Equipment A, then Chemical B is added using Equipment B and they react. While Equipment B is in use, another process using Reactor C may be at the stage where it is ready to also use Equipment B, but needs to wait for first process to finish using it. Each of these 'steps' can typically be classified into some kind of 'unit operation' that more or less will always require the same amount of workers (if run in vacuum). There are maybe 3 or 4 categories of solids additions, 2 categories of liquids additions, 12 different types of reactions, and so on and so forth. For the sake of simplicity, we can also say that each category of unit operation will take the same amount of time to perform once started.

At this point it would be fairly simple to calculate how many workers are needed at a given time just by adding up whatever our process timeline would spit out. ""If process A is already using equipment B, then push back process B to wait for completion."" What complicates the situation is that the same workers will sometimes run process A and process B at the same time if their respective pieces of equipment are in the same area. This will also affect how long each step takes. This is entirely dependent on the unique combination of equipment in use and other unit operations running at the time. If we have the manpower available, we are usually pretty good at assigning the right amount of workers to a process in the moment.

If we could track the real time data for what unit operations were running at a given time and how many workers were needed in actuality to do the work, we could come up with some kind of model to predict number of workers. Naturally, we have recently created tracking software that does exactly this. We can see how long each step took in reality, and we can see how many workers participated in completing it. Based off the same tracking software, we can also tell what other pieces of equipment are in use at that time and what unit operation they are in use with.

The machine learning algorithm I am envisioning would predict the amount of workers needed and the amount of time needed for each step to complete, based off the input of what unit operations are running on which pieces of equipment. We could then feed the algorithm with the number of workers actually assigned to a particular area and how long things actually took. We could include confounding factors like plant shutdowns or outages of particular equipment in the model to make it more representative of reality. Over time, the model will learn to recognize patterns and tell us what we want to know.

Has anything like this been done before? How far removed is this from what machine learning is normally used for? Could I come close to the amount of data needed to train my machine learning model? Am I completely bonkers for thinking this would work?

Input would be much appreciated! Really curious to see if something like this would be within the realm of possibility.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Each of my nodes are linear and each layer is fully connected. The neurons are represented by a function

    N = a1*x1 + . . . + an*xn + b,

where a's are weights of the neurons, x's are inputs, and b is the bias. The neurons fire with Relu activation so the true value of N would be max{0, N}.

As of right now all of the framework is complete and I have a simple game that I am testing the neural network on. However I am not getting the results I expect.


I believe my current problems lie in back propagation. As of now i am updating each weight, say ai by taking the partial of my output neuron, say O, respect to ai. So after each forward pass of the neural network I measure the outcome to get an error and then update each weight cj by 

    cj += dO/dcj * stepSize * error
My partial derivitevs are taken on the function 

    N = a1*x1 + . . . + an*xn + b  for each neuron

rather than on the function 

    max{0, N}. 


   

I was wondering if there is more that needs to be done for back propagation and if my techniques seem sound.

I would also like to know if using linear functions is acceptable or if it might be better to choose other functions. I picked linear functions due to their partials being very easy to compute.

Lastly if you know of any good resources on neural networks of a similar design, I would be interested in seeing them. Many of the ones that I have found are either two basic, dealing with neural networks of 4 or so neurons. Or they are far to general that I have difficulty implementing the ideas to my specific framework.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

Are there any machine learning techniques that can deal with input ""matrix"" of the form AxN and outputs of the form BxM, where A and B are constants but N and M very from time step to time step?

Example task: There are a variable number of balls that fall from the top (Y=100) to the bottom (Y=0). On each time step new balls might appear. Each ball has a unique ID, a current Y coordinate, a vertical Velocity, an X coordinate between 0-9, and an X Target: [ID, Y, V, X, T] x N balls in play. On each time step, the AI can decide for each ball separately to push it to the left (X-=1) or right (X+=1): [ID,-/+] x M balls to push. The AI is ""punished"" with -1 for each pushed ball. Balls disappear when they hit each other or the bottom, and the AI gets a reward of +10 if the ball was in the right column (X=T).

Are there any ML techniques that can *learn* this?

(Bonus question: what if there are also different *kinds* of input objects? E.g. the AI can also observe floating platforms that should never be hit with coordinates for left, right and height, and a horizontal velocity.)

Model compression for deep neural networks is a fairly popular research topic these days (it was much more popular an year or so ago). Does anyone know of any paper which compares performances of *compressed* models against those when the *compressed* models are trained from scratch?

In other words, we have two ""small"" models of the same architecture - one obtained from compressing a large model, another obtained by training the same small model from scratch. Have there been any studies which compare the relative performance of these two? 

The only case I know of where these are compared are the knowledge distillation papers.

I am developing a compression algorithm for real-time image compression. As the images are from a specific domain, i think i should be able to outperform general compression algorithms like JPEG. Note that I have a huge amount of training data. My idea is to use some sort of convolutional autoencoder, where i encode the bottlenet representation into binary to get the code. I plan to optimize for the reconstruction loss, maybe also to use adversarial training.

Before committing to this approach, i wanted to ask if you guys see any flaws in this? Maybe you know some recent research in machine learning based image compression? I found some papers on deconv nets, and RNN based approaches. What is the current ""way-to-go""? In what direction would you point me?

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this question.

I'm a Masters student applying to be a student volunteer in this year's NIPS. 
As a part of the application, my guide needs to send a recommendation letter. He's agreed to send the letter but not sure of what should be in the letter or how different it should be compared to, say a recommendation letter for admission into a graduate program.

Could someone who has experience with the application process tell me what kind of a recommendation letter is expected?

Something as simple as averaging the vectors of their last 5 documents they consumed springs to mind but am not sure if this might be a bit silly as wash a lot away in the average. Maybe some sort of knn approach in the space might be possible. 

Then i'm wondering - the same way we just use a doc_id in doc2vec, how crazy would it be to just add in a user_id token and try that way to get a representation of a user in much the same way as a document.

I'm doing it with BiLSTM+CRF for NER (extracting places in text where it is said about time) + LSTM for classification (specific dates, hours, minutes and modes - is it interval or not, absolute or relative time,...) + some code to convert that classification to datetime values.

On the one hand, I don't have a training set. On the other, I can write a bunch of templates of time indication myself and then substitute a random hour\minute. So, I've coded a function which generates a dictionary data structure with values randomly chosen from finite discrete sets and then builds a proper string. I use that data structure as a classification target.

I find that architecture quite interesting - instead of solving direct problem of text analysis, I solve reverse, more simple problem of text synthesis and then unleash ML on it. And that makes me think that here I could somehow apply active learning because instead of randomly generating source data structure I could somehow analyze history of training and actively select values. And because data structure generation is sequential with some fields depending on another (for example, if we choose to output time interval then there will be 2 time values, otherwise only 1), that active learning probably should look like parameter tree exploration, where nodes are some global parameter selection and leaves are concrete hours\minutes. For example, if teacher finds out that network is weak to some kind of examples = some branch in tree, it should be more inclined to palm off these templates but with other hours\minutes.

I recently started looking into object detection for a project of mine and was wondering if am missing something to get stuff off the ground.

I want to implement a real time object detection system on a raspberry pi 3 for surveillance of an open spaces for eg a garden. I have already tried a few available solutions. I don't need to detect many classes(only 3 person,dog, bicycle) so maybe the fastest option can be retrained with fewer filters and parameters thereby decreasing the total compute time.

**Darknet(YOLO)** [https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet] 
Installed default darknet tested YOLOv2 and YOLO runs on a raspberry pi3 each frames runs for approx `450 secs` for each image.
Tiny YOLO had run for `40 seconds` per image.

**Tensorflow Google Object Detection (API)**[https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md]:
I had tried all available networks.
The best performing one was SSD inception network which runs at `26 secs` per image.

**Microsoft Embedded Learning Library (ELL)**[https://github.com/Microsoft/ELL]:
I could not get this to work for some compilation reasons but will try to check it out again later.
Please let me know If this worked for you and how it performs in Object detection tasks.

**Darknet-NNPACK**[https://github.com/thomaspark-pkj/darknet-nnpack]:
Here the darknet was optimized for arm processors and had convolutions implemented with some kind of FFT implementations with speeds up stuff a lot.

I have achieved most promise from this but it has its problems.

Installed darknet tested YOLO(full v1) runs on a Raspberry Pi3 each image requires 
approx `45 secs` which is 10x faster than default YOLO network.
Tiny YOLO had run for `1.5 seconds` per frame but gives `no results`.

This is possible bug reported due to version conflicts between the models and the cfg files. I have opened an github (issue)[https://github.com/thomaspark-pkj/darknet-nnpack/issues/13] a while back and yet to receive a response.

**MXnet (SSD)**[https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet-ssd]:
Port of SSD in Mxnet (not compiled with NNPACK)
MXnet SSD resnet 50 per image `88 sec`
MXnet SSD inceptionv3 per image `35 sec`


**Caffe-YOLO**[https://github.com/yeahkun/caffe-yolo]:
Running caffe on yolo_small works  with `24 sec` per frame.
Running caffe on yolo_tiny works  with `5 sec` per frame.
This looks like the fastest of the one I have tried unless the darknet-nnpack issues could be solved.



Did I miss any other framework/model that could get better results?
For now If I cant get any better results I would train the tiny yolo(nnpack) and maybe look for quantizing options later to speed it up.

I have chickens and they like to follow each other around (get scared and scream when they cant find each other) and do dumb stuff all day that seems like it would be pretty easy to teach a chicken robot to do.

This is a little tricky because lots of animals are pretty accepting of weird things as long as they get reasonable interactions and/or food from them. For example, we were worried at first that our dog might eat our chickens but the first time she came out a chicken pecked her on the nose and she ran away and is now scared of the chickens. She will still follow them around and if they are eating something (like birdseed) she will get jealous and try to eat it too, then get confused cause its gross. That has happened so many times lol

The hardware design might be tricky but I think making a little robot ant that is accepted into an ant colony would also be impressive and less susceptible to this problem and currently is very hard to do. Perhaps a termite or bee colony might work better since they are bigger idk but yea passing the Animal Turing Test I think would be really cool and interesting for studying animal behavior in its own right",9,8,False,self,,,,,

These systems are hard to train since the step from the coordinates found by the attention mechanism to the actual smaller images is non-differentiable. Has been done successfully with reinforcement learning(recurrent models of visual attention, deepmind).

However, if one assumes that the pixels in the original images simply are samples of a function f(height,width), for instance the function one gets by interpolating said image bilinearly, then this step surely should be differentiable?

I'm curious how one would go about clustering faces incrementally as you receive them. If your embedding is accurate enough you could just compare an incoming image with an example from all current clusters. If you get a match to add to that cluster or else you just add a new cluster. This would require a ridiculously accurate classifier, but I wouldn't put it past the companies mentioned to make something like that.

### Information Theory 101
This informative and let's be honest, [quite dense post](https://blog.recast.ai/introduction-information-theory-care/), goes back to the roots of information theory, giving the spotlight to [Claude E. Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) who layed out the basics of modern information theory in his paper Mathematical Theory of Communication published in 1948.
Before Shanon, information theory was already studies but much different from what we know today. Essentially, most observations, rules and theorems were channel-specific. The only understanding everybody agreed upon was the tradeoff between rate and reliability. In this paper, Shanon proved the tradeoff invalid.

### Why should I care about Information Theory for Machine Learning?
The goal of machine learning is to have a computer able to learn by himself, without being explictly programmed. So, to put it back in our terms, ML goals is to maximizes mutual information. 

Diverse Information Theory paradigm are now frequently used for Machine Learning such as:

* **Clustering by Compression (ZIP/RAR/GIF/JPEG...)**: Instead of saving twice (or more) a redundant information, only the reference to the second iteration of the information (and the nth one) are saved to reduce the overall file size without loosing quality. (Was it the lossless one?)

* **Classification**: Both supervised and unsupervised classifications methods relie on paradigms coming from Information Theory. They are useful to sort large set of data: classifying a music library by genre for instance.

You can find the article [here](https://blog.recast.ai/introduction-information-theory-care/). It's quite a read but it's definitely worth it to anyone who wanna beef or freshen up one's knowledge on Information Theory and one's understanding of Machine Learning.

So have you read it? What did you learn?",25,71,False,self,,,,,

I am really happy to finally get a chance to post something to https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/. 

The last three weeks I was working on ImageMonkey - check it out here: https://imagemonkey.io/. 

The idea originated while I was working on another project where at some point I wanted to integrate Machine Learning into my application. With all the great Machine Learning frameworks out there, it's really easy to get your foot into the door quickly. You can easily download a pre-trained model and re-train the last layer with your own image dataset.

But while I was playing a little bit with the frameworks, I somehow realized that it's really hard to get some good training data. If you are lucky then there is some (annotated) training data online, if not...well, then you have to get your hands dirty and do the tedious work yourself. So I thought to myself: Wouldn't it be cool to create a image dataset that's publicly, open source and easily 
accessible? That's the point ImageMonkey was born.

While working on ImageMonkey I realized one thing quickly: It should be easy to get data in there and easy to get data out there. If it's too complicated to donate, annotate or validate pictures nobody will do it. That's why there is a mobile app, a soon to be released Google Chrome Extension (Validate a picture every time you open a new tab in your browser) and a REST API. I am sure there are lot of improvements, but I think for a start it's not too bad. 

**Whats next?**

As this post already is pretty long (and I am not sure if anyone still is reading ;-)), I will keep this one short. (If you are interested, there will be more detailed blog post available soon)

* Hardware Upgrade + Caching: Currently everything is running on one really small machine

* Online Playground: It would be cool to actually test how good/bad our image dataset is classifying images. So it would be nice to have regular (Tensorflow?) builds which are based on the current image dataset.

* API abuse prevention: As the API is public there needs to be some sort of API abuse trigger that goes off when someone tries to destroy datasets on purpose by maliciously voting for the wrong images.

* add some sort of gamification to attract also non-tech related people

* API improvements 

* Bugfixes (there are always bugs to fix)


If you are still with me - thanks for reading! If you have questions, ideas, suggestions or feedback - please feel free to do so. 
Any input is greatly appreciated.



**Questions**

In /r/SideProject I got a pretty interesting question from /u/benscar1 which I want post here as well, as I think it's a great topic for a discussion. 


&gt; How are you going to convince people to annotate or label the images for no compensation?


That's a really good question, that I also thought a lot about lately. Do you think that there is compensation needed in order to convince people to contribute or will they feel the need to contribute when they are actively using the service in order to give something back? Honestly, I don't really know. What motivates people to contribute to Wikipedia? (serious question, as I haven't contributed anything to Wikipedia yet I really don't know what people motivates to do so)

I personally think that simplicity is key here. If there are people out there that want to contribute something they should be able to do it with just one click. Ideally without any registration. People should be able to contribute without any additional hassle.

I could imagine that some data, that already has a high propability to be valid, can also be used in child's games. e.q: ""Mark all apples on the picture"". Due to this, it might be possible further increase the dataset's quality. Of couse we have to be fully transparent at this point that the data is used for something, so that users can opt-out if they don't want to participate.. And yeah...the game should be fun for kids :D

Given that we have categories with a lot of training images, it might be possible to let the neural network do the initial annotation/validation.

What I could also imagine is to build a captcha like service that people can implement in their webpages . E.q: ""select all pictures with an apple""


What do you think? What motivates you to contribute something to the public? 

Cheers,

Bernhard ",10,24,False,self,,,,,
