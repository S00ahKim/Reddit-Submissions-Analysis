If I train the SVM with the historical data is there a way to determine what the best weightings for the vector components should be. For example wind speed maybe a large contributor to the prediction where as sock color may have no effect on the prediction .

From what I've been reading the vector components being fed in the SVM have to be weighted ahead of time or they are all given a weighting of 1. Is this true? Is weighting the vector components even required? If they are what is the proper way to determine the weights? ",2,5,False,self,,,,,

First I want to say this is a little long, so I appreciate those of you who read through this. 

I am a senior in college who, having just taken an engineering optimization course (some GAs, convex optimization, etc.) last semester and loved it, came across something called machine learning and realized it was something Ive always been interested in. Ive looked through countless forums and discussions on the net about it, but I need specific advice about where to potentially start such a journey into the field. I am a Mechanical Engineering major, and through my curriculum, have taken Stats, Linear Algebra and the like, and will be taking an actual Machine Learning class before I graduate. 

Some questions for you all:

1. Is grad school really necessary/worth it for this field? I mean are there enough reasonable industry jobs right now in which a Masters geared towards ML is warranted? Or is ML as it is now still a tool in the toolbox for most engineers? Keep in mind I definitely want to work in industry/a startup. I have no intention of getting a PhD.

2. If so, do you have to go the CS route for grad school, or is Stats also a viable option? Given my major, I dont see myself getting into grad school for CS, due to the sheer amount of programming I dont have experience inso it might be possible for a different department?  I understand it that the CS path might be for more the application side, which is what Im looking for, while a Stats/Math grad program might focus more on the mathematical theory behind ML?

3. Also, my GPA took a hit (currently under a 3.0), during heavy semesters; I might have put more effort into other courses rather than say, stats a few years back (kicking myself now). I do go to a top engineering school that is in the 15-20 range in the nation for my major. Still, does that kill any chance of getting into a school that would be worth it? Is perhaps getting a MEng preferable for someone in my position?

4. Lastly, if you dont recommend grad school, is ML something thats easily applicable to other fields? I was thinking robotics given my undergrad. Or more out of the boxcould the type of ML algorithms that work for voice recognition work for recognizing patterns in other sounds (music)? 

Sorry for the wall of text, any help on these matters is greatly appreciated.

I collect short spans of ~250 or so data points from the sensor, forming a time series. 

Given 10 or so time series, I want to make a classifier so that I can take the 11th time series and give it a similarity score to the previous 10. Ideally this similarity score ranges from 0 to 100: this is the most important part. 

How should I go about doing this? So far I have tried dynamic time warping, which gives good relative similarity scores for my time series, but the result I find incredibly hard to scale to the 0 - 100 range. E.g. for my ""best"" matches, my DTW score is 30 - 50. For my worst, it's 400+. And for complete fails it's 800+.

Hopefully I've made my problem clear. Basically I'd love a way to score similarity of novel time series to a pre-saved set, and have that score scale out of 100. I've tried DTW for this purpose which is good for relative similarity, but I can't figure out how to do the scaling I want.

I'm texing up my resume, and was hoping to report on some work I did this summer at an internship.

For my summer work, (I worked at a mobile marketing firm) I developed a predictive model to quantify the unsubscribe rate that we would see following sending a message blast.  In mobile marketing, subscribers can text ""STOP"" to unsubscribe from lists, and I looked at the different things involved in predicting these unsubscribe rates.

I framed my problem as a multi-class problem, where each class corresponded with rates of list unsubscribe rate (for example, 0 was no unsubscribes, 1 was 0-.05% of the list would unsubscribe, etc etc).

What metric should I report when describing my results for my resume?  I achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forests for the multi class (91% for a two-class formulation!).  But is percent accuracy a good metric?  

If possible, I want a metric that anyone would be able to understand. So in this way, I am attracted to raw accuracy.  So I'm unsure if something like sensitivity/specificity (does this even work with multiclass) would be appropriate

yes I used cross validation and split up my training and test sets following rigorous methodologies

My initial questions is:
Would the machine learning happen at every turn? So basically every turn would be treated as it's own measurable event with a best possible choice, then driving the best behaviour each turn.

I am not completely new to Machine Learning as I've done a few classification projects using Weka's GUI and J48/Neural Networks/NaiveBayes/SMO.

Now I want to expand my knowledge.  I have a web app that I want to see if I can find any patterns in the data from the users database.  I have a nice excel sheet of 1000 rows of user data with something like ~150 columns/features.  The first few features are descriptions of the user and the remaining are their scores in different games on the site.

I want to see if I can find any patterns in the data, maybe see if users who are good at one game are good at another etc.

A couple issues that I can think of that I am not sure what to do with.  With that many features there might be categories with little to no data so all users would have a 0.  Another problem would be that not all features are useful themselves in finding patterns so I may want to reduce the data.

So the issue is that I am not sure what these techniques are called nor know any tutorials that will help me.  By using google I am going to be trying clustering and see if I can get anything with that.  But I am not sure if that is the only technique to find patterns in this data.  I am not sure if it can handle my concerns and what techniques I should go to reduce the data appropriately.

I have been working with large nns lately and have been using batch stochastic gradient descent to train them online using live data with fixed a learning rate.

I am seeing fairly slow convergence rates which is consistent with my experience with fixed learning rate learning. In my experience, I have seen hieruistic methods like iRPROP work much better since they optimize the learning rate on a parameter-by-parameter basis. I have found they converge significantly faster.

I am wondering if anyone has heard of using resilient propagation used in conjunction with batch SGD?

I would imagine running irprop for a while on the batch, then incorporating like:

 g1 = ((1-lr) * g0 + (lr * g_irporp))

where g1 is the updated gradient, g0 is the orig. gradient, and g_irprop is the gradient obtained after some amount of irprop.

lr is the ""learning rate"" which will get implicitly scaled by the per-variable parameters learned using resilient propagation... So this seems ""smarter"" than pure SGD, but would have some issues perhaps because irprop is being run on fairly small batches.

We would like to implement a system that can get the topic of the document and tag it automatically getting the most relevant words from the text.

In our DB we already have past years documents tagged by the user so if this can be used by a ML algorithm we would use that, too.

Now we are an web-based IT company so we don't know much about ML so we would like what would be the best technique / method to achieve that.

I think its an important and potentially helpful idea, and its seems to me that sentiment analysis would be a useful tool to apply - not that I know a great deal about it.

I've been trying my hand at a couple machine learning competitions on the kaggle site as my next step from the course offered by Andrew Ng on coursera. I competed in the titanic competition and did well, I learned alot and was happy with the outcome. Now I've moved on to other competitions where the data is much larger, GBs of data vs Kbs. I was able to compete in the titanic competition by simply going through the data with ipython notebook + R and perform my analysis quickly. Currently thought my computer (i7 1.8Ghz, 4gb ram, 256gb SSD) feels like the limit. I am using Sci-kit learn, iPython notebooks, and R Studio. I am pretty lost on how I should get started with a problem of this size, it feels intimidating. So far my current thought process for dealing with a dataset in the range of 5-80gb would be:

* Load all my data into a SQL database (Postgres or MySQL).
* Create a subset of the data that is small enough to work with in R studio.
* Write my data filtering + feature creation scripts on this small subset as a test.
* Once satisfied I should deploy this script on the rest of the data.
* Do batch training on my dataset
* reiterate etc....

How should I go about importing the data files? My shell freezes when I try to import a 6gb CSV into MySQL.

Any other suggestions would be awesome. Im eager to continue learning but its becoming frustrating as I clearly am not making optimizations where I should be, but do not know any better!
