I was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.

I joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that Im in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. Whats worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably dont look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.

For example, Ive never heard of the term Lipschitz or Wasserstein distance before, so Im unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf). I dont have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The Normalizing Flow (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation)  each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I dont even know where to start wrapping my head around. 

Ive thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesnt work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. Its an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but  

* reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I cant just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldnt be happy.
* but if I dont read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle. 
* the utility density of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I dont have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again. 
* in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with Langevin flow. The oracle would return a list of pointers, given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishops PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of . Google is not such an oracle for my purpose. 

Im willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. 
Is it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration? 

EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation! 

EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many people from different backgrounds to join the discussion. Looks like there are many who resonate with me! And thank you so much for all the great advice and recommendations. Please keep adding links, book titles, and your stories!

Should dynamics model and policy network accumulates gradients for each time the upward gradients comes in ? This can be decomposed into different cases as following: (For simplicity let us suppose only 2 time steps. )

1. Compute J = c1 + c2 
Backward: 
1.1): c1 -&gt; dynamics model -&gt; a0 -&gt; policy
1.2): c2 -&gt; dynamics model -&gt; [a1, s1] where a1 -&gt; policy and s1 -&gt; dynamics -&gt; a0 -&gt; policy

The gradients of dynamics and policy accumulated for each time upward gradients passing through. i.e. after 1.1), both dynamics and policy have gradients. During 1.2): when firstly pass through dynamics, the gradients computed and added to old gradients (from 1.1) and so on. 

2. Backward pass for each time step: backward of c1 -&gt; clean gradients of dynamics and policy -&gt; backward of c2, then sum up the gradients of policy in each individual backwards.

3. Dynamics model not accumulating gradients, only to flow gradients when backward pass. But policy accumulate gradient. 

4. Neither dynamics nor policy accumulates any gradients. e.g. for c2, the gradients only obtained when it reaches policy network which generates a0, all other passes of dynamics and policy, just compute local gradients and flow the gradients, not to add up gradients with their `.grad`. 

It is a bit confused which might be the correct way to do it. ",4,3,False,self,,,,,

I'm about half way through in a few weeks now and I'm pretty excited by what I'm learning and what I see as potential jobs.

Most positions listed I've seen list a masters degree as a requirement. Not having one seems like an overly easy way for my resume to get filtered. 

Physically going to a top ranked university near me in Chicago would easily cost me close to $100k over two years. Not to mention a great deal of time, energy, and stress in simply getting to/from school and working around the class schedules.

UIUC offers a masters in data science through coursera for around $20k. While UIUC is a very reputable school, obtaining my degree remotely might have some unintended downsides. Number one being a lack of connections being built in the field. Number two being the large number of skeptics out there regarding online degrees.

As another option self learning is certainly something I enjoy doing and could perhaps tackle some online challenges and steer my daily work towards putting machine learning to use. I just don't know if having a nice set of historical work is enough to avoid the ""no masters"" trash pile I imagine exists.

I would really love to hear what the community has done themselves and how well it has panned out.

Were you able to find a great position without a masters? If so did you have a lot of historical work to show?

If you did go the graduate degree route, was it worth it? Did you find it useful in getting in the door a few years in or was it a moot point? Did you use connections made in school to get a position out of school or after?",14,4,False,self,,,,,

Even though the photos being compared are as different as apples and apple computers, training accuracy easily hits 100%* with 5 dense relu / dropout layers and ~15K cases across a variety of histogram types. Test accuracy interestingly diverges for portrait and landscape pairs, numbers here:

I speculate that it's because portrait pairs are joined at the hip, while landscape pairs are joined at the elbow, so are more disjoint.

I often need a progress bar with loss monitoring, validation loss and metrics at the end of batches, early stopping, learning rate decrease callbacks...

I can do it myself but it's a pain and it's time consuming. I'm not sure tflearn is what I want but maybe I should invest time to get how it works.

We have a large scale web service that allows 'publishers' to submit content (hundreds of files totaling dozens of GBs along with some metadata). We then process the files and metadata and prepare them for distribution to 'subscribers'. The end to end workflow can take several hours but varies based on various factors - characteristics of the submission itself, characteristics of our service at that point in time, other submissions that are in queue and potentially various other factors. 
When the publishers submit their content, they want to know an ETA. This must be a typical problem for such scenarios. Is machine learning a good approach to solve this? If yes, which algorithms are ideal for this. Simply Linear regression or do the latest advancements in ANNs make them better suited for this? Surprisingly (or maybe not), I didn't find many ML research papers on this.

Edit - we have significant volume of existing data for this, which could potentially be used for training. I am not sure however if we have kept a record of all the 'relevant' features though.

&gt; With a discrete action space, well use a neural network that outputs action probabilities, i.e., the final layer is a softmax layer. With a continuous action space,
well use a neural network that outputs the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with a separate set of parameters specifying a diagonal covariance matrix. Since the optimal policy in an MDP or POMDP is deterministic, we dont lose much by using a simple action distribution (e.g., a diagonal covariance matrix, rather than a full covariance matrix or a more complicated multi-model distribution.)

But isn't it the case that with function approximation we can have *state aliasing* and therefore there might not be any deterministic optimal policy? For instance, if we should really go left in s1 and right in s2, but we *can't* tell s1 and s2 apart, then going left exactly 50% of the times in s1=s2 might be the best choice.

---

edit: I pinpointed the location in S&amp;B's [book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2017june.pdf). At page 337 (357) it reads (the emphasis is mine):

&gt; In problems with significant **function approximation**, the best approximate policy may be **stochastic**. For example, in card games with imperfect information the optimal play is often to do two different things with specific probabilities, such as when bluffing in Poker. Action-value methods have no natural way of finding stochastic optimal policies, whereas policy approximating methods can, as shown in Example 13.1. This is a third significant advantage of policy-based methods.

And then a little example follows which shows the problem.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I am thinking to use multi-task learning, hoping that this will boost performance a bit on the fields with few samples. 

However, how do I transfer knowledge from one region of the map to another? There should hopefully be knowledge about how the different fields relate to each other that is universal across the entire map, and I want to exploit this...

Only thing I can think of is training the model on the entire map, then removing the first few layers (closest to the input) and retraining them on a smaller area. Can this be right?

I don't think I'm the only one that thinks this subreddit has become cluttered lately. The increase in basic questions and blog posts about very simple stuff is something I very much think has lessened the quality of this subreddit. Now if you disagree with this, feel free to downvote or ignore this post. However, if you do think this is a bad thing, I hope this can be a good place to discuss possible solutions.

For the simple questions, the solution should be simple. Create a weekly post where we can post simple questions as comments. I will certainly use that as a resource myself, and I think others will as well. One argument against this is the MLQuestions subreddit, but that subreddit is pretty much useless for anything more complicated than logistic regression... In addition to the simple questions megathread, we can also have a career megathread, that opens for career questions, course questions, etc. Now for blog posts, I don't see any solution though and I would love to hear your ideas here. 

So, what do you guys think? Should we accept the simple questions, have a megathread, ban them altogether, or something completely different that I couldn't think of?",44,53,False,self,,,,,

Let c be a binary vector describing a CNN architecture. The candidate CNN may have variable layer size, activation function, filter width/height and etc, and the dimension of c is about 2400. Each input vector has dimension about 12 in the way compatible with the encoding rule, and the input ""sentence"" consists of 200 input vectors. Since the output dimension is different from that of the input, encoder-decoder (w/ attention) is needed, and I prefer QRNN or SRU to be used. The issue is the following: since each layer has different size (# of weights), and since each candidate architecture has different depth and n-th layer size, there is no canonical way to map each output vector to weights of the layer. What would be a good way to do it? How do I implement the process of substituting output vectors {o_i} to weights of CNN c, as this kind of task, as far as I know, isn't commonly done? 

One way I can think of is to use a single MLP/CNN to map each output vector to weights of the corresponding layer, and another way is to naively map the elements of the output vector to weights of the corresponding layer and discard the excessive last elements of the vector. However, I'm sure there are better ways, and I have no idea how to make them more concrete. 

The reason why I'm not using memory bank is to make the algorithm more amenable to replacing the network to be searched for from CNN to RNN and other kinds.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I checked out the pytorch tutorial (and it seems cool, particularly the dynamic graph part) but they seem to jump straight into using the neuralnetwork part of the library.  Can anyone point me to sample implementation of NN architectures in pytorch, TF, chainer that do _not_ use the high-level NN parts of the library i.e. the equivalent of implementing a GRU or LSTM in theano using scan.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Workshop
NIPS 2017
Saturday, December 9
Long Beach, CA, USA

Please address questions to: hrlnips2017@gmail.com
*******************************************************

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for tackling complex sequential decision-making problems as demonstrated in high-dimensional robotics or game-playing domains. Nevertheless, modern RL methods have considerable difficulties when facing sparse rewards, long planning horizons, and more generally a scarcity of useful supervision signals.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is emerging as a key component for finding spatio-temporal abstractions and behavioral patterns that can guide the discovery of useful large-scale control architectures, both for deep-network representations and for analytic and optimal-control methods. HRL has the potential to accelerate planning and exploration by identifying skills that can reliably reach desirable future states. It can abstract away the details of low-level controllers to facilitate long-horizon planning and meta-learning in a high-level feature space. Hierarchical structures are modular and amenable to separation of training efforts, reuse, and transfer. By imitating a core principle of human cognition, hierarchies hold promise for interpretability and explainability.

There is a growing interest in HRL methods for structure discovery, planning, and learning, as well as HRL systems for shared learning and policy deployment. The goal of this workshop is to improve cohesion and synergy among the research community and increase its impact by promoting better understanding of the challenges and potential of HRL. This workshop further aims to bring together researchers studying both theoretical and practical aspects of HRL, for a joint presentation, discussion, and evaluation of some of the numerous novel approaches to HRL developed in recent years.

Basically I want to compare various approaches to adapting to non-stationarity (methods with built-in online learning, [deep knn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08833), stuff based on inferring local latent variables, [random walk networks](http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/03/14/random-walk-deep-net/), etc )

The canonical example of this from the business side is things like click prediction, where seasonality effects and year-to-year trends and so on are big issues. I've played with these kinds of data in Kaggle competitions, but the problem is that those datasets generally aren't allowed to be used outside of the context of the competition. This seems like the gold standard of what I'm looking for - fairly predictable when you do it right, but strong non-stationary effects, and a large volume of moderate-dimensional data. I found a [UCI dataset for buzz in social media](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Buzz+in+social+media+) and another on [online retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) that might work for this.

Financial data seems obvious, but the problem is that even in the best case the performance is going to be very close to chance level, so as a benchmark it doesn't provide much dynamic range for comparing different algorithms.

I think climate and atmospheric emissions data might be a good candidate, although period of monitoring could be an issue. There are a number of large gas sensor timeseries datasets on UCI, but they're generally in artificial controlled settings. 

This [household electricity usage dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) seems like it might be good if somewhat low-dimensional.

Something involving video frame prediction might be really good for this, if heavy, since data is abundant and varied.

So I made some experiments where I actually tried to use more than the diagonal of this matrix(But still not the full matrix). The notebook below contains an example where using such an approach makes a problem converge that would not otherwise converge easily with mini-batch methods.

    (0.1, 0.4)
    (0.5, 0.2)
    (0.9, 0.5)

and so on - I already know how to get the data into whatever shape i need, the problem is the model. It crashes my program on start. Here's the model and the error. (the model is supposed to take in two ordered pairs and return the next one - i have data formatted like this)

    def create_network(depth):

	model.add(LSTM(4, input_shape=(2, 2, )))

	model.summary()
	model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',

I just released [pomegranate v0.8.0](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) with many updates from a summer of work, including [much more thorough documentation](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Each section in the documentation has it's own FAQ so that questions don't get cluttered in a single page and are easy to find.

New features:

* [Built-in Out-of-core Learning](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ooc.html): By specifying a batch size, you can now train GMM and k-means models on a numpy memory map that couldn't fit in memory
* [Minibatch Learning](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minibatch.html): Train your models on batches of data instead of requiring the full dataset (can be used in conjunction with ooc)
* [Semi-supervised Learning](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semisupervised.html): Train naive Bayes, Bayes classifers, and hidden Markov models using a mix of both labeled and unlabeled data to get better models
* [Built-in Parallelism](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallelism.html): Parallel prediction and fitting are now built in for all models simply by passing in `n_jobs`. Parallelize your prediction step with just `model.predict(X, n_jobs=4)`, and parallelize your GMM training the same way!
* [Use a GPU](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu.html): Multivariate Gaussian distributions can now use a GPU through the CuPy package under the hood, meaning all models (GMMs, HMMs, Bayes classifiers...) that use them get sped up too! Around a 4x improvement on tests I ran.
* When learning a Bayesian network, the dataset will now be reduced to the set of unique samples and the sum of the weight of the samples. This frequently can provide a massive speed improvement (I've seen up to 20x)

The full release notes can be found [here](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whats_new.html).

The next major feature I'd like to add in to pomegranate is missing value support for learning models (and structure learning for Bayesian networks / HMMs). I am also interested in adding in more data types for out-of-core learning, and generally expanding that interface.

As always, you can get pomegranate either by cloning the repo and installing from scratch, or by running `pip install pomegranate`. As a note, it currently is not compatible with networkx v2.0, and so you may need to downgrade to v1.x to use pomegranate.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Feel free to open an issue or message me directly.",7,53,False,self,,,,,

Currently I'm using dlib to extract the landmark points from the face picture, and am planning to use the ratio between the interocular distance and the distance from the point between the eyes and the nose tip, and the ratio between the interocular distance and the distance from the point between the eyes and the upper lip. Basically, ratios 1 and 2 from the six ratios depicted in the ""Age Classification from Facial Images"" paper by Young H. Kwon and Niels da Vitoria Lobo (because the paper said those two are the most reliable in practice). Also, for wrinkle density, I'm using the Canny edge detector with 50 for both horizontal and vertical thresholds, then calculating the amount of white pixels divided by the number of pixels in the region.

Are those three variables feasible to guess the age group? If so, should I use SVMs, or Linear Regressors (because the most basic would be guessing the category of the age, though if I could guess close to the exact age, that would be better)?

Another thing: should I change my dataset if the mean of the variables per group differs so much from the median and if the standard deviation is basically 25% of the mean?

Also, should I replace the Canny edge detector with the Scharr/DoG and calculate wrinkle depth too?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I'm guessing the age from a face image resized to 160x160. If that's too small, I probably should change it to 256x256 with bicubic interpolation...",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Back then I decided to start from scratch which may have put off some of you. Now we're finally getting to the advanced stuff:

* (Nonlinear) Conjugate Gradient
* Hessian Free Optimization
* K-FAC
* Trust Region Policy Optimization
* Proximal methods in RL
* Natural gradient methods
* Stochastic Computation Graphs

I'm willing to go as far as learning some Differential and Information Geometry, if necessary for proper understanding:

* [Differential Geometry and Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Statistics-Monographs-Probability/dp/0412398605)
* [Information Geometry and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Geometry-Applications-Mathematical-Sciences/dp/4431559779/)

While I already knew the basic stuff and was able to lay down an efficient learning path for it, this part is new to me so I'm also exploring and enjoying the scenery as I go.

I typically work in sklearn at work, but I've been wanting to get my hands dirty with tensorflow or pytorch to start to learn more (hands on) about deep learning. I have a nice gaming rig at home with a GTX1080, but the base OS is Windows. I realize a number of these frameworks can probably be installed natively on Windows, but I *loathe* development on Windows.

My first inclination was that I could install docker (or docker-nvidia) on windows and just use a docker image, but after reading, it seems docker does not have GPU passthrough or whatever necessary to allow the VM to access the GPU.

I looked into if it is possible with VMware, and its not clear to me. Supposedly VMware has GPU passthrough, but I don't know if that translates to it actually functioning with deep learning libraries.

Does anyone know if its possible to have a windows host with linux VMs for deep learning? Or is my only viable option to dual boot?",15,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently working on a project where I'm building a neural networks model for prediction/simulation. In this application the derivatives of the input variables are of importance. I would like to start a discussion regarding recurrent networks and derivatives.
Say that you have a recurrent networks with 1 lag/back loop, then you the output yt will be a function of x_t and x{t-1}. One simple approximation of the derivative is xt - x{t-1} which is called the ""delta"".
Would you say that a recurrent networks with 1 lag/loop can capture the structure of the first order derivative? And are there any articles discussing this?

Looking at the MNIST example in Tensorflow's own tutorial for the Digits classification, I've identified four layers:

 * Convolution Layers that, I think, filter a block of pixels depicted in the kernel size variable (5x5, for example), into one neuron (with the filter being any permutation of a 5x5 window).
 * Pooling Layers that are commonly called Downsampler Layers.
 * Dense Layers, the classifier layer depending on the features from the Convolution and Pooling layers. Does this mean that more Conv and/or Pool layers makes more features to classify with?
 * Logits Layer, the output layer with as many neurons as there are classes in the data.

As far as I know, there are also ReLU Activation layers that can be used with any of the layers above.

Are there more layers I need to note?

And if I intend to make an age estimation CNN (I think it's similar to Face or Face Feature Recognition CNNs), would I need around 10 Convolutional Layers connected to Pooling Layers each, and only one Dense Layer and Logits Layer?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Maybe a body suit with thousands of air-actuated 'pixels', in addition to visuals, with a gimbal full suspension system like in Lawnmower Man. Github code? 

Edit: Thanks for the reactions. I was thinking that dimensions &gt; 3 might be mapped into the body suit tactile sensations you'd have of, say, swimming through seaweed, with stronger force feedback a glint in my eye. More prosaically, hand gestures could be used to navigate the dimensional mappings. t-SNE would be an obvious choice for a math engine.

Once I read that mine removal efforts in a tribal area were running into problems because the local people were not accustomed to mapping 2D pics of mines to 3D objects. Perhaps we are currently blind to higher dimensional mapping abilities that we can learn, given a tool to explore them.

Edit: Vis-a-vis the limitation of 3 dimensions: aside from the perceptual dimensionality of new mappings to the axes of body movement and sensation, I assume the ability to use your senses in time as you navigate the dimensions to construct a new kind of model, perhaps analogous to what mathematicians 'see' in their mind's eye.

Once at NASA I participated in an experiment where I tried to follow a moving dot with a mouse that had some crazy unintuitive movement mapping, presumably related to astronaut perceptual situations. It forced me to return to the developmental stage at which I originally learned such mappings, causing very interesting sensations as I built the new pathways to achieve the goal. I am doing my best to lure humanity as a whole to jump through such hoops, in order to challenge assumptions and build a more survivable world view.",16,11,False,self,,,,,

to which a class needs to be assigned. Always 1 of k possible classes.
There is a relation between the output, for example, if n1 is k3, n4 is likely to be k5 and cannot be k3. The output is mutually exclusive.

I have trained a Decision Tree classifier in scikit learn to go over one input, with one output. 
The results are pretty good, but because it does not have the context of the other n-1 inputs, it cannot be as accurate as I want it to (for example, it can predict that n1 and n3 are both k4).
I have also trained a Deep Learning ANN in Tensorflow to do same thing and got to very similar results.

I work for a startup who recently went through a costly exercise of gathering labeled data for training algorithms.  Was largely language processing tasks.

It got me thinking about self driving cars and whether companies are getting individual images labelled. Instead of presenting a bunch of images and asking if there is a stop sign, and to put a border around it, what about hooking up some sensors to a car, and just measure the break pressure, as the annotation for the ""data"", being the image/video in-front. Hook up enough Tesla's who are measuring breaks and what the images are in-front is potentially a lot of ""labelled"" data. Compare all the hard breaks and start to see some patterns.. people veering near the car, stop signs, etc. If nothing else this could limit the set of images for annotation. 

Not sure if the idea has merit / is currently being used - but throwing it out into the world!

All sentiment analysis code and datasets I stumbled on were considering only a binary output: positive or negative (or ternary: positive/negative/neutral). I am working on something that would output a number between 0 to 1 (or graded such as 1..5 or 1..10) to differentiate between sentences that express a very negative thought/connotation from others at different levels. Are you aware of such a dataset ?

Any alternative, like using some sort of semantic analysis to produce such labeling as an initial data that would need to be cleaned up manually ?

however, [this](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1) article is a little different in that it simply goes straight from inputs to outputs, with no hidden layer in between.  Most other articles seem to follow the three layer approach for hello world ANN models.

Does this technically qualify as an ANN for teaching purposes, or must we have at least three layers to be an ANN?  (input, 1 hidden, output).  I want to use this simpler model as the first ANN in the content I am producing, but...but only if it technically qualifies as a neural net.

I discovered this neural network architecture (that I have named as Absolute Neural Network) while pondering over the thought: ""Do we really use different parts of the brain while imagining something that we memorised?"".

I went on and investigated this question further and finally found the answer. No! the answer is 'NO'. We use the same part of the brain in the reverse direction while visualising an entity that we memorised in the forward direction.

Key findings:
1.) A feed forward neural network can learn in both directions forward and backward.

2.) Use of Absolute (modulus) function as activation function supports this bidirectional learning process. (We had been wondering for so long why ReLUs work the way they do. Seems ReLUs were just half correct.)

3.) By tweaking the learned representations, We can generate new data.

4.) Using this architecture, there is absolutely no need of any regularizer. This backward learning is the ultimate regularizer.

5.) By replacing the softmax function (for converting raw activations into a probability distribution) by a simple range normalizer, the model performs better. I can only think of one principle for explaining this phenomenon. ""The Occam's Razor"".

6.) After training on MNIST dataset, I obtained a very low variance model (without any regularizer) that has the following accuracies:
Train set: 99.2506265664
Dev set:   97.7142857143

Do comment what you guys think about it.

link to video -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSK1nw3YBVg&amp;t=4s

This completely changes the face of supervised learning. I have always felt that there is something more to supervised learning than what we have been doing so far. We had the raw power of a neural network for all this long and now is when we can unlock its true potential.

Thank you!

Unlike search, it's just a constant feed of information, so the ""query"" is just the user.

If the recommender system starts with no user data (clicks), then it can't do collaborative filtering. Here's one method I've heard suggested for bootstrapping this system:

1. Unsupervised: learn embeddings for a huge number of web pages (possibly using Doc2Vec on the text of the page or Node2Vec on the link graph, any embedding will do)
2. Create a nearest neighbors index on those embeddings
3. Rank web pages by objective popularity in some way (possibly page rank, or use Facebook's API for shares/minute, whatever it is, features have to be hand-selected because we have no user data to perform validation on)
4. Present most popular content to new user
5. Record user clicks
6. When querying for new content, just find the N articles closest to the average embedding from the user's clicks (using the nearest neighbors index). Alternatively, do this without averaging the clicks so we don't suffer from mode collapse, i.e. get closest 5 from one of their clicks and closest 5 to another of their clicks.


I assume there are smarter methods for this common task of bootstrapping a recommendation system for web content. Any paper recommendations?

EDIT: I should mention that [On bootstrapping recommender systems](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nadav_Golbandi/publication/221615658_On_bootstrapping_recommender_systems/links/55b92ce308aed621de0863a8/On-bootstrapping-recommender-systems.pdf) assumes that you have data for some users, just not data for this particular new user, so that paper isn't very useful to me.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

From experience, what routes would you suggest for solving a regression-based problem, in terms of network topology for a DNN? Should your approach to network topology differ depending on if you're doing a classification vs regression task?

Let's say you have a benchmark root mean squared error from a gradient-boosted decision tree, or basic GLM (e.g. multiple linear regression). You're trying to beat this with a DNN. An initial single hidden-layer dense NN that is wide doesn't yield good results, nor does a deeper network with less units.

In other words, if I start out with:

- Dense 2000 units, relu activation and get almost double the RMSE as my GBT model
- Dense 50 units x 5 layers, dropout in between each, and get a little better RMSE but still far off from the GBT model

*More detailed questions:*

Is there a 'rule of thumb' on network topology/a path that one should take, or is this entirely experimental, throw it at the wall and see what sticks? In this scenario, since I see a slight improvement in a deeper rather than wider network, does it make logical sense to make it even deeper? Or should I focus more on trying early-stopping, adding dropout vs adding more layers, using a different optimizer, changing my batch size?

(My decision for wanting to use a DNN stems from feeling like I've exhausted my ability to generate meaningful features. I'm wanting to see if a DNN can identify complex interactions/features that I can't, and to use them to generate better predictions.)

The inventor of an important method should get credit for inventing it. She may not always be the one who popularizes it. Then the popularizer should get credit for popularizing it (but not for inventing it). Relatively young research areas such as machine learning should adopt the honor code of mature fields such as mathematics: if you have a new theorem, but use a proof technique similar to somebody else's, you must make this very clear.

I have gameplay statistics for a few hundred games from random players for each league tier: Bronze, Silver, Platinum, ...... etc.

Surprisingly, there is hardly a difference between the statistics for each tier.  All tiers average extremely close to one another in basically all area (kills, deaths, wins, assists, gold earned, gold spent, etc).

What I was hoping to do was be able to classify which league any given player likely belongs to, but I'm not sure if its possible given the way the data is spread.  Visually speaking, If I try graphing the data, there are really no discernible differences.

If one was to attempt classification, what techniques/algorithms would be most useful given that the data is not linearly separable and has no obvious clusters?   I was looking into K-Means Clustering as a possible solution but I'm not sure how accurate it would even be.

I am interested in the (simpler?) case where I already *know* the target distribution and I want to train the generator G to generate outputs that follow this distribution. Say for example I want to approximate the standard normal. My first thought was to simply use as my objective function the likelihood of the batch of synthetic data (generated by G) under standard normal, but this is simply a MAP/MSE estimation and the end result is that the generator G only generates points very close to 0 (a very squeezed Gaussian). How could I train G to actually produce points that follow standard normal?

**Edit:** I dont have *real samples*, but I do know the target distribution. G has to be a neural net mapping from noise to samples. I want to fit the weights of G so that the generated samples follow the target distribution. The trivial way to do it would be to draw samples from the known target distribution so that I have a set of real samples, define a discriminator and do the whole GAN thing.

Can artificial intelligence recognise human-made doodles?

Google had their own experiment called *QuickDraw* to verify this, and it was quite successful. But, it is hosted on a huge cluster of servers, and is constantly trained and improvised. But as we move into the future, we shift to the mobile generation. So the question which comes next is,

'Can a neural network running on your mobile device recognise your doodles?'

This application is built as an experiment to answer the same. The best part? It is open source for all the free minds to experiment on existing code to make the most out of it!

Every time you play, you'll be given 8 random objects to draw (from nearly 100 categories), and the app will try to guess it! It may not always work, but let's see how well it performs for you!

If you find the application worth your time, kindly rate it and share it with your circles so that they can feel the power of AI!

""Identity is the artificial flower on the compost heap of time."" -- Louis Menand, ""Listening to Bourbon""

""It was bigger than me, but it was me."" -- An adopted woman remembering her birth mother.

Suppose I'm an idiot savant with an amazing talent that, Cassandra-like, no one else recognizes, and I train a simple 5-layer net on a limited set of data (2304D, 2 groups of 18K positive cases I've picked since January), use the top prediction weights for a random sample, and after a few days of wondering why it looks so bad, I reverse my sort of the weights and get results so good that I am sick, and, on reflection quite angry that a few days of work *as a &lt;%$%$%&gt; first-time effort* could clone this almost terminally unique hypothetical skill that even another person cannot understand. I had a harder time learning how to program in C, and machine learning is supposed to be hard, right? [more stylized cursing edited out, in case reactions below are puzzling]

That said, and possible talent aside: *why do we rely on anything other than fingerprintable behavior for identification?* 

Static info is out the window with the [Equifax] breach &lt;update latest breach&gt;. I confess I have at least one pretty detailed idea how to do it at teller machines, and a bunch of design principles I'd use to cook up other modes. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people had looked into it and the ideas didn't pan out, or maybe are in hot development. 

You can look at my ML result and what I apply it to here:

Edit: can't change title to 'angers', oh well. Going back to look at my app, I want to run away and complain again. Here is what I saw:

Another phenom is that I have been curating my training set with an eye toward what will be understandable to other people, but these predictions get under my skin in a way that makes it impossible to see objectively enough to decide, like this:

The digit recognition CNN for MNIST uses 2 Conv-Pool layers followed by a Dense and then a Dropout (40%) layer before a Softmax Logits layer, while the face recognition one using the LFW dataset uses has 3x(Conv-Conv-Pool) layers followed by the same Dense-Dropout (20%)-Softmax Loss layers, and the one using the CASIA-Webface dataset is the same thing except with extra 2 Conv layers after the 3 Conv-Conv-Pool sets.

What determines the combination of these layers? Is it the quality of detail within the image required in the classification, that being: more subtle details needed = more Conv/Pool layers?

Also, people say I can use more than one Fully Connected (Dense and Loss?) layer in my CNN model. In what condition would this be necessary? Can I use it when deciding the votes from four fully connected layers pertaining to specific regions of the image?

Do I add Dropout layers when the model starts overfitting, and if so, where?

NOTE, possibly off topic: Currently I'm using the CASIA-Webface CNN config for my age classification project (8 categories). The results so far (128 batch size, 1050 steps) is a bit encouraging, I've seen probabilities going up from 0.125-all to something like [0.21, 0.15, 0.15, ..., 0.12, 0.03]. Is that a good sign?

Also, last time I used the LFW config in the site, and trained it with batch size 64 for 3600-something steps. The results when I tested it in my test fold was 36% accuracy w/ 1.78 loss (better than my previous effort using the bare minimum MNIST config - 20% accuracy w/ 2.02 loss)",15,17,False,self,,,,,

I am attempting a project where I could train a model on a large dataset of Ableton Groove files (say, a large set of Latin grooves), and see if it can generate its own groove file based off what it has been trained on.


The structure of an ableton (.agr) file is simple and can be parsed as XML. 
[An example of this parsable file is shown here.] (https://pastebin.com/spP8Nh6a)


From this file, it's shown that each &lt;MidiNoteEvent&gt; has a Start Time (as a ratio rather than in seconds), Duration, Velocity, and ""Off Velocity"" which, when all features are combined, represents that specific Midi Note Event. Thus, an array of these &lt;MidiNoteEvent&gt;s represents a groove/swing template for 8 or 16 bars. 

Thus, with a large enough dataset of groove files generated from similar grooves (Say - a *ton* of salsa music), we could train an algorithm to output a similar groove file?

I can see from this file that it should be simple enough to turn each of these properties of a &lt;MidiNoteEvent &gt; into a feature. Since each feature is purely numeric, training seems relatively straightforward.

My question is, how should I go about thinking about this problem? With a feature set and dataset as depicted here, which algorithm and approach should I be thinking about here?

I am currently taking a course in the verification of cyber-physical systems. When I say that, think formal and probabilistic verification of state machines for safety. It's a graduate course and the professor wants us all to do a large project. Anything that somewhat relates to the course material is fair game. I thought about mixing it together with machine learning. 

I've found this paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-017-0999-8 which is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. I could just do a summary of current developments in the field but that seems pretty dull. At the same time, I only have a month and a half to work on this project. Do any of y'all do research in this topic? Are you aware of other topics that relate to the intersection of machine learning and model verification? Any suggestions on project topics?

So, lately I have felt that the predominant AI research ala DNNs etc, have focused more on the 'pattern recognition' aspect of things. This is really great. And certainly, there is no shortage of materials in regards to material to learn all that. 

However - I have lately become more interested in AI as it pertains  to general reasoning... my problem here is that I do not know where to start looking. The keywords, community, methods, papers etc that permeate the internets do not seem to have anything to say about this. 

So my question is simple: Where do I start?

It's said that visit counts N(s, a) and action values Q(s, a) are used in the MCTS. But aren't there **too many** such pairs to be calculated? We are talking exponentially many possible states, and also every possible action you can take in them.  
  
Is it the case that they just store the visited state-action pairs, and assume zero for elsewhere?

I have a dataset of about 150 items, and I split them into two sets for training and testing. The data is randomly distributed between each, and I test my classifier with 4 different but common ratios (50/50, 60/40, etc) for the dataset split.

I pass ratio #1 to my classifier, and run it one time, then 5 times and then 10 times, for K = 1 to 10, and get the average accuracy values, and plot it on a graph. This shows me how the accuracy changes with single run, 5 runs and 10 runs on values of K = 1 to 10.

I repeat this with ratio #2, ratio #3 and ratio #4.

I then take the average of all runs across 4 ratios and plot a graph. 

I then take the K value that gives the most accuracy across these 4 ratios.

I know about K-fold cross validation, but honestly doing something like that would take a long time on my laptop, so that's why I settled with this approach. 

Is there anything I can do to improve how I am measuring the most optimal value of K? Do I need to run the classifier on a few more ratios, or test more values of K? I am not looking something complex, as it's a simple classifier and dataset is small.",33,12,False,self,,,,,

I am the only data scientist at a small startup using machine learning as it strategic differentiator. I have done everything from designing machine learning pipelines, to implementing and monitoring them.

I have been exposed the past few months to the roles of Product Managers and how they make the bridge between business and engineering. It made me think of the famous Venn Diagram of Data Science being at the intersection of Business / Stats / Engineering.

Since then, I have been wondering if there was any framework to manage data science projects, or any dedicated tools available?  

How do you guys manage your projects?  
From idea, to handling the data, to logging experiments and monitoring models.  

So far I have used a mix of trello for my backlog of ideas, google sheets for experiment results and custom dashboards to track production models.  

Whats your flow?

- we were not allowed to use any libraries.
- make it as accurate as caffe.
- make it as close to caffe's speed as possible.

Obviously we did not win because we were a couple of microseconds behind the winner, however we achieved all of the objectives and thought we would share it with you all to take your feedback and for you to explore it and use it.

I have been looking for methods to encode those as smaller dense vectors and autoencoders seem to be the best option for a first shot but I don't really know if they are well suited for this kind of problem..

If they are, what kind of auto-encoder should I go for? Also which loss would be the best? I was thinking of a composition of both softmax and MSE to avoid being stucked in local optima but it might not be necessary..

Also, if you know about better methods to solve this problem, any resource would be very appreciated! I have looked at CorEx (https://github.com/gregversteeg/bio_corex) which seems really promising but it doesn't scale at all with the number of parameters nor the number of samples :(

My task is to build a neural network, which should be able to solve problems from analytical mathematics.  

I have talked to my supervisor and he told me the title is intentionally so general, so I can focus or pick whatever specific topic I want. He also said the dream goal would be a neural network, which could integrate given functions, but from a little research I did online it seems, it's really dreamy goal.  

My experience with NN is one course at university, we covered supervised and unsupervised learning and little bit of deep learning. I am supposed to work with supervised NN in my thesis.  

The problem is I can't imagine what kind of problem from analytical mathematics would be doable and would be of corresponding difficulty for a master's thesis. I have passed all the bachelor maths courses- algebras, analysises, statistics, diff eqs, pdeqs, etc.

I've recently started my adventure with machine learning and I've stumbled across a problem with anomaly detections.
My data is a lot (120 000) of short time-series (about 20 in length) of bought products in periods of time across several months.  The data consists about 1300 time-series which are known to be non-anomaly which can be used as an example of how the time-series should look like.
What needs to be achieved is to create a way to detect anomalies in the other 118 700 time series. It would be rather easy to do it with the statistical approach (variance approach) but I really want to somehow do it with machine learning.
One idea would be using LSTM to predict next value of time-series and if the difference between the predicted value and exactly value is too high then it must mean that it is an anomaly. Although I found a tutorial that predicted stock prices with LSTM and the prediction was quite poor. ( https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/07/08/predict-stock-prices-using-RNN-part-1.html )

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of problem? I want to know where to begin or how to approach such small-sized time series.

I'm considering starting a hobby ML project to improve my (currently novice) ML skills. I'm an embedded systems software developer, thus I want the project to contain some ES as well.

My idea was to create an online fall detector of a spinning top. I.e. use a continous stream of sensor data (accelerometer/gyro/vision) to predict if the spinning top is going to fall over soon. There are obviously many different approaches to model this problem, and I was hoping I could get some tips and inspiration to figure out a good one.

My first idea was to use an online classifier to classify labels ""stable"", ""wobbly"" and ""down"" and raise awereness when X successfull predictions of the ""wobbly""-state has been made.

However, I'd really like to use some anomoly detection (for educational purposes). I've been briefly looking into using LSTM and compare predicted state with actual state to catch anomolies, but unsure how well that would work on streamed sensor data? Any unsupervised learning anomoly detection that could be feasible? I've looked a bit into PCA too, which would fall into that category I guess.

Any ideas and pointers are highly appriciated. What would be your prefered method and why? If this belongs in a different subreddit I apologize - hard to know where 'beginner questions' ends...

I am about to start writing a thesis in dimensionality reduction (my specialization is applied math and I am interested in machine learning / data science, I have been working in this field as an intern for some time). I am having hard time choosing the exact direction of my thesis. I was told by my supervisor to describe some algorithms and apply them, but I can more or less do whatever I want as long as it is sufficient for Masters thesis.

I really like t-SNE. But everything has been done here and it is implemented in many languages, so you cannot actually come with something new. What is currently the hot topic in dimensionality reduction? I was thinking about combining Autoencoders+t-SNE or focus more on GPLVM (Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model). Any suggestions on other topics? Or any benchmark that you would be interested in? Implement some fancy algorithm?

It just feels like if you google long enough, there is a paper and library for everything.

Thanks! Any help is really appreciated!

The design that I made to test this uses a random hyperparameter search with about 20 parameters (on model, but also on data), and is as follows:

* Train and Test the model on hyperparameter configuration **A** (e.g. 4 layers &amp; 150 neurons per layer) with activation *""Relu""*
* Then train another model with config **A** with activation *""Elu""*
* Then train another model with config **A** with activation *""Selu""*
* Train and Test the model on hyperparameter configuration **B** (e.g. 8 layers &amp; 300 neurons per layer) with activation *""Relu""*
* Then train another model with config **B** with activation *""Elu""*
* Then train another model with config **B** with activation *""Selu""*
etc.

Because the training doesn't take too long I can run it about 250 times within a reasonable timeframe. With 3 options for parameter ""Activation"" this would then translate to 80 different configurations.

After training - what would be the best way to see if the Selu activation performs statistically better than the other activations? 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I need to clarify something.

Putting aside the question of which data points would be most predictive, could this information be used as additional input to the standard single hidden layer neural network used for learning word embeddings as implemented by word2vec?

First off, can you concatenate multiple one hot and real number inputs into one long vector? So if you have **V** words in your corpus, **P** parts of speech one hot encoded, **R** possible origin languages one hot encoded as well, and a real number input for number of syllables, could the input vector be of shape (V + P + R + 1)?

The output softmax layer would presumably not contain these additional data points and maintain a shape of (V) (or *(V, 1)*).

My other question is what would be the best way to extract the embeddings? In word2vec, you take the connecting weights between each word and the embedding layer. Would the embeddings in this model be the sum of the connecting weights of the word, its part of speech, etc.? It would seem that the part of speech and origin language would have (partial) embeddings as well, and the final embedding for a word would be some function of these embeddings and the word embedding itself.

I'm just trying to think this through and see if this is already a well explored technique - I have another application for this in mind but want to make sure I understand the problem first.

I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology. I am planning to apply to Master's programs specialising in machine learning for Fall 18.

I would like to pursue an MS in machine learning to help me decide if would like to pursue a PhD in the field later on as well as to fill the gaps in my undergraduate education required for pursuing a career in machine learning. Also as of now I intend to work as a research assistant or similar position in academia or industry for a year or two after my Master's before deciding on PhD or industry.  

Till now I have been mostly looking at MS programs in USA and Canada. Most of these are 1.5-2 years long MS CS programs with specialisation in machine learning. They have course work as well as research component (in the form of both dedicated credits and a thesis component).  

Recently I came across MSc programs in the UK at universities which have good ML research going on. The programs I am looking at are :

* [UCL MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught/degrees/computational-statistics-machine-learning-msc)

* [UCL MSc in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught/degrees/machine-learning-msc)

* [Edinburgh MSc in AI (Machine Learning Specialisation)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;id=107)

* [Cambridge MSc in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/egegmpmsl/study) 

All of these programs are 1 year long and seem to focus mostly on coursework. They do have a dissertation in the end but it's not very clear to me if it will involve original research work like a thesis or something else. Moreover I am skeptical of he quality of work that can be done due to the time and coursework constraints.  

It would be really great if someone could enlighten me regarding the quality and rigorousness of these programs. Also what are the prospects in both industry and academia after graduation from such programs both in the UK/EU as well as in USA/Canada for a non-EU citizen.  

Thanks in advance.

As a reasonably new person to the field of Machine Learning and programming in general (working in Python for 6 months now), I wanted to go to this forum and ask for some feedback and suggestions for an assignment I just started. For this assignment I have to look into machine-learning possibilities that automatically classify incoming invoices to decide what kind of repair was done on a car. The invoice data is available in a table structure and contains the following variables that could be used to predict the outcome: 


* Meterage: integer
* Product? : Boolean
* Service?: Boolean
* Shop ID: integer, refers to a certain shop
* Product code: string
* Product description: string
* Amount: float (is 3.4 when for example gallons of oil used, and round numbers such as 1.0 or 2.0 when a single or two objects are replaced)
* Price: integer
* Date of repair: date structure 
* Price inc vat: boolean


Now there are two large issues I can think of right away:


1.	There are between 1030-1500 different outcomes. Some occur very frequently, some almost never.


2.	The product code and product description probably contain the most useful information. The only problem is that there are no specific rules in how to write repairs down. So while some invoices have complete sentences (the engine oil was replaced or the engine oil was supplemented), other invoices state only (MOTOROIL) where it doesnt specify if it was replaced, or only supplemented. 


To counter issue 1 a lot of training data is needed. An expert in the field suggested me to have at least 10 training data for each different outcome. This means I have to have at least 10300-15000 invoices, and probably more considering some repairs are really rare.
The second issue worries me more. I do not think there is any algorithm with in-build text analysis. For instance: MOTOROIL, motoroil replaced and the motoroil has been replaced mean the same thing, yet the algorithm just sees three completely different strings if I am correct. So perhaps a dictionary has to be built first that translates these strings into usable strings to feed to an algorithm. However, this can take a lot of time, considering how many different repairs there are.


Lastly, my choice of algorithm currently would be a Nave Bayes Classifier. If it doesnt perform well enough, I will move on to more complex classification algorithms.


I would really appreciate some feedback and advice based on the information I just provided. Especially on the following questions:


*  Are there any other caveats with having so many different outcomes, except the fact that a lot of training data is needed?
* Am I correct in my assumptions that a dictionary is needed before the algorithm is trained, because it cant handle the randomness of the product code and product info descriptions?
* Is Nave Bayes a correct choice to start with? Or would you consider a different algorithm?

Many thanks in advance!

I have tried to find any references to the two together, but didn't find any, so thought it's important to get this idea out as it might get the ball rolling with people who are more professional than me in this field. 

My theory is that during awake times the human brain records what we can relate to as the training set via our senses, to the parts of the brain who store it for later processing. 

When the brain goes through REM sleep the brain first disables most of its control over the body (in order to prevent hurting yourself when neurons fire during sleep, which might activate muscles in the body), and then starts firing neurons in a pseudo-random way, with some similarity to the random input to a GAN model. 

This firing of neurons could be the brain running its own GAN, which results in a new 'generator' neural network, with a better 'fit' to the data set it collected during the waking hours. 

Than, during the awake hours, the generated 'generator' neural network/s are used as a model to better predict the incoming data. 

Taking this a step further, now that we imagine our brain as a model, or multiple models (?) that are trained by the input from our senses; we can now use the predictive abilities of this model to be able to record only the stuff that our (internal) model did not predict, thus capturing just the data set that is the most crucial to improve our model in the next REM sleep/GAN session, completing the cycle. 


Here are some references which led me to my theory:

* A very nice explanation to [GANs by Robert Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw9r8CL98N0)
* Wikipedia article about [REM sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep)
* Article about [REM sleep selectively prunes and maintains new synapses in development and learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4479)


I don't know if this is utter bulshit, but it seems to be so beautifully descriptive of what seems to be a recipe for a general intelligence, able to learn by repeatedly running a GAN model against a data set that is produced by recording the deviations of recorded data from the 'generator' predictive model that the GAN generates/maintains.",19,23,False,self,,,,,

Apparently, when my linear regression makes its prediction - it has something like -1000 MAE (when compared to the MAE of an all-zero vector), and as I divide the estimation of every observation by some factor, it improves dramatically:


* factor 1.5 |  mae: -458.303432094
* factor 2 | mae: -211.376918945
* factor 3 | mae: -50.0865186752

* factor 15 | mae: 20.5381352161
* factor 20 | mae: 16.7937150084

*Note: the MAE is sometime negative because it is compared to the MAE of an all-zero vector. So -1000 means that the MAE of an all-zero vector is better than the algorithm's prediction by a 1000. My model does only slightly better than an all-zero vector when I divide my model's estimation by 10.*

*Note2: The scores are on the validation set (not the train set)*

Why is it that my linear regression guesses numbers that are so big, such that they harm the MAE score so significantly? Is there any good method to deal with that?

edit: important to note that this model is not overfitted or so. The results reflect reality - dividing by 10 does better in both validation and test set.",9,1,False,self,,,,,
