So far the best candidate I found is [SparseLib++](http://math.nist.gov/sparselib++/). However, their site says the project is in ""minimal maintenance"" mode. 

Then there are some Java projects like UJMP and Colt that look to actually be alive.

So, is the action in this area of scientific computing moving to Java, or am I overlooking some C++ project that is actually being maintained?

He just finished his thesis on Machine Super Intelligence, and he talked about a formal definition of intelligence.  Most of his stuff is about theoretic optimal models which are uncomputable, such as AIXI.  However he has been able to implement some things using monte carlo methods.

Here is his [thesis](http://www.vetta.org/documents/Machine_Super_Intelligence.pdf).  I'll post the video when it becomes available.",7,14
