We propose the first deep learning approach for exemplar-based local colorization. Given a reference color image, our convolutional neural network directly maps a grayscale image to an output colorized image. Rather than using hand-crafted rules as in traditional exemplar-based methods, our end-to-end colorization network learns how to select, propagate, and predict colors from the large-scale data. The approach performs robustly and generalizes well even when using reference images that are unrelated to the input grayscale image. More importantly, as opposed to other learning-based colorization methods, our network allows the user to achieve customizable results by simply feeding different references. In order to further reduce manual effort in selecting the references, the system automatically recommends references with our proposed image retrieval algorithm, which considers both semantic and luminance information. The colorization can be performed fully automatically by simply picking the top reference suggestion. Our approach is validated through a user study and favorable quantitative comparisons to the-state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our approach can be naturally extended to video colorization.

So I believe we can train a neural net to do the exact same thing.

But I could not figure out how to represent this information in a neural net as we need to encode the information of a time unit in order to succinctly determine that a person is suspicious.

Thanks so much for all the support Redditors for HyperLearn! [https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn](https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn) \[Made it to the Trending Github list for Jup Notebooks!! yayy!\]

Anyways, I didn't update the code a lot, but that's because I was busily testing and finding out which algos were the most stable and best.

Key findings for N = 5,000 P = 6,000 \[more features than N near square matrix\]

1. For pseudoinverse, (used in Linear Reg, Ridge Reg, lots of other algos), JIT, Scipy MKL, PinvH, Pinv2 and HyperLearn's Pinv are very similar. PyTorch's is clearly problematic, having close to over x4 slower than Scipy MKL.
2. For Eigh (used in PCA, LDA, QDA, other algos), Sklearn's PCA utilises SVD. Clearly, not a good idea, since it is much better to compute the eigenvec / eigenval on XTX. JIT Eigh is the clear winner at 14.5 seconds on XTX, whilst Numpy is 2x slower. Torch likewise is slower once again...
3. So, for PCA, a speedup of 3 times is seem if using JIT compiled Eigh when compared to Sklearn's PCA
4. To solve X\*theta = y, Torch GELS is super unstable. Like really. If you use Torch GELS, don't forget to call theta\_hat\[np.isnan(theta\_hat) | np.isinf(theta\_hat)\] = 0, or else results are problematic. All other algos have very similar MSEs, and HyperLearn's Regularized Cholesky Solve takes a mere 0.635 seconds when compared to say using Sklearn's next fastest Ridge Solve (via cholesky) by over 100% (after considering matrix multiplication time) --&gt; HyperLearn 2.89s vs 4.53s Sklearn.

So to conclude:

1. HyperLearn's Pseudoinverse has no speed improvement
2. HyperLearn's PCA will have over 2 times speed boost. (200% improvement)
3. HyperLearn's Linear Solvers will be over 1 times faster. (100% improvement)

Help make HyperLearn better! All contributors are welcome, as this is truly an overwhelming project... [https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn](https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn)

As I am creating my own neural network from scratch and am still a novice, convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks are a bit out of my reach.

I'm an undergrad doing a double major in pure math and stats at a public university in the US. I've done a limited amount of ML research with a professor here (though I will likely not be published) and have had a few data science/analysis jobs over the years (but none were ML). Also, I am a senior graduating in spring so I will very likely be applying to grad schools during this semester and I am intending on pursuing a PhD in CS and working specifically on ML research in some form.

My question is regarding how or if I should go about contacting faculty at other schools. It is my understanding that graduate school selection (both mine and that of the schools I apply to) is more about how well your interests mesh with the faculty, and that often people go to a specific graduate program because of a specific professor that works on research that fits their interests. I've read people suggesting that if you really like a particular school/program you should reach out to faculty that have research that interests you, which does make a lot of sense to me.

Should I simply send emails to a few professors discussing their research and asking if they have positions available? And, in general, will I be looked upon drastically unfavorably for not having been published? The thought of asking for a position *directly* bothers me a bit because I feel like no matter what I've done in undergrad it is not enough to sell myself for a position of significance like this. I feel like I'm either being very critical of myself or very realistic but I can't tell which it is. 

Additionally, some professors (strictly in a CS or Stats department) have some really interesting research but it is heavily interdisciplinary... am I at a significant loss if I don't (yet) have a background in the intersecting discipline? 

I appreciate any advice people here might have. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I have started in the noble endeavor of getting the (somewhat) higher ups of the company I work at to at least consider ML. I work in automotive so the bulk of our ""problems"" have to do with things like finding the perfect distance between the car's center of gravity and its back and front wheels, the ideal weight etc. 

So the entire deal can be formulated as a fitness function ripe for optimization.

The actual function works like this: we get a number of test cases, lets say 10-15, test cases representing cornering at 100 kph, lane switching at 150 kph etc. and we have a universal test function that, given a set or parameters(like mentioned above) returns an error percentage. For example:

    get_error(test_case = lane_switch_100kph, 
        weight = 2000, // kg
        front_axle_dist = 1.3, // meters
        back_axle_dist = 1.4  // meters
    )

And this function return a float in the interval [0, 100] that specified the ""error"", how much the car deviates from the ideal path when these particular parameters are used. This error needs to be brought below 10%.

I threw together a genetic algorithm (if it matters, I did it in python, using the DEAP library) and tested in with the Rastrigin function and all was great.  For the fitness function of the actual simulation I used the mean of the squared errors for all test cases.

On paper this looked simple enough. As a start I need to optimize a more general simulation that only has 4 parameters, so a 4 variable function, which should be simple enough for a genetic algorithm to solve, it fared great with Rastrigin in 100 dimensions so a 4 dimensional function should be a piece of cake.

This particular model was already done by hand a few weeks prior and it is possible to get the error below 10% on all test cases.

Problem is the algorithm, while it DOES improve the mean square error, it does so extremely slowly. For 11 test cases, with the initial errors hanging around 10-30% and the initial MSE hanging around 800 the algorithm seems to be in the final phase of converging right away, going from ~800 slowly (1-3 MSE decrease per generation) to about 725-750 and converging there.

I did not do any optimizations to the algorithm as I figured I would do that after I get a proof of concept done. 

My current implementation details are:

* 4 dimensions as I said, each with its own lower and upper bound.

* Mutation is selecting one of the 4 dimensions randomly and randomizing its value.

* Mutation probability is 0.3.

* Crossover is simulated binary bounded.

* Crossover probability is 0.6.

* Population size is about 50.

* I'm using tournament selection with a tournament size of 1/4 of the population.

* Every generation 3/4 of that generation get selected, 1/4 are replaced with new individuals.

Optimizations I planned on using but have not implemented yet.

* Elitism.

* Adaptive mutation parameters using a clustering based method as described [here](https://matlab1.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Clustering-Based-Adaptive-Crossover-and-Mutation-Probabilities-for-Genetic-Algorithms-matlab1.com_.pdf).

I am kind of stumped on how exactly I should proceed as the algorithm kind of... getting trapped into a particular local optima right from the start on multiple runs is something I did not even think could happen and have no idea how to fix. Any suggestion would be appreciated alot. Thanks in advance!

I've written this tool in frustration with the current tools to manage data dependencies. 

I used to manually upload/download/backup my ML data and models. This worked until I accidentally overwritten some models that took weeks to train. 

After that I started putting everything in git with git-lfs to make sure everything is preserved. But when I started working in a team our repository grow super-big and took ages to pull. So we gradually abandoned putting all data files to git-lfs...

I made lazydata as a middle path: hashes of files are stored in a version-controlled configuration file, and these are automatically verified, versioned and tracked for all files you use in code. When you pull the repo you get the config file and when you run the code  files that are needed are seamlessly downloaded.  

This has so far worked well for us, so I thought of sharing it!

https://i.redd.it/b6t22gi491k11.png

There are a number of forms of forgetting in the human brain, and this is a normal, adaptive, and necessary process for learning. One of the more interesting is the active form that helps us concentrate on some special task by moving all information that is unnecessary at that moment to unconscious memory. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist, became the first person to study memory experimentally. In his early experiments, he encountered the problem of proving that something has been completely forgotten because, allegedly, forgotten information can still affect behaviour and is quite often remembered later. As a result, a definition was proposed that forgetting is the inability to extract from memory at a particular given moment something that was readily extracted from memory earlier.

Later experiments on memory were conducted on the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis due to the fact that their nerve cells are rather large, with many of those nerves identified and their functions described. There is one nerve cell without which L. stagnalis cannot learn a new skill. If this cell is destroyed, the molluscs not only lose the ability to learn, they also do not forget previously learned behaviours. The model in this study proposes to translate this function into artificial neural networks and define the architecture with active forgetting mechanisms, which gives the name of the model, active forgetting machine (AFM). The AFM contains special neural networks that allow temporary forgetting of unnecessary information by disabling unwanted neurons, and then other combinations of neurons are activated to learn and solve some task.

Hi everyone,

I'm an independent developer working on my own ML projects for about a year now.

For the past six months, I've been building a wrapper around PyTorch for making
Deep Learning development easier.

It's called MagNet.

*****

The core idea of MagNet is the Node.

Nodes are PyTorch modules that can change their properties dynamically based on the computational graph.

This way, they attach to each other... like magnets!

For example you can define a simple 3-layer CNN as follows.

    model = nn.Sequential(mn.Conv(32), *mn.Conv() * 2, mn.Linear(10, act=None))

Note that you only need to specify the bare essentials.

No need to specify the strides, paddings, input sizes, or even flatten the output before feeding it to the final layer.

Also, MagNet provides a customizable ``Trainer`` class which helps you avoid writing boilerplate code and focus on the project at hand.

    trainer = SupervisedTrainer(model)

    # Tracks the loss, metrics and adds a nice progress-bar
    monitor_callback = callbacks.Monitor()

    # Train the model for one epoch
    trainer.train(data(batch_size=64, shuffle=True), callbacks=[monitor_callback])

*****

I've found that MagNet has greatly reduced my codebase and increased my productivity.

Im really excited to see how this framework will enable developers to create better Deep Learning projects,
and discover new possibilities.

Really appreciate if you guys could take a look at it and tell me what you think.",15,28,False,self,,,,,

I changed architecture a little bit. Mainly made it deeper, used some layer sharing and at the end upscaled result and applied convolution. You can still get samples with greater resolution, but you have to increas size of kernel and upscale weights in the last convolution. Also the difference is that I used chinese fonts instead of casia dataset. On github there is code for training and interpolation and creating samples. There is also model for MNIST, but it was mainly for sanity check. The generator produces countless chinese like charcters. They do not look like fonts (but they are fairly close).  I still have to check for coverage, but I think it fairly high number. The generator is a light model under 1MB so I am amazed that it managed to create such diversity. 

The training dataset consists of 8k 64x64 images randomly generated from fonts. There are around 3k different characters. it may seem too high, but there is a lot of common elements and fonts have simpler structure than pictures.  

I included some experiments on latent space exploration, but it is work in progress(more information on github).

Like do you think it is informative? Is there something missing? Please leave your comments below.  Is there something I can do better in reddit posting?* 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hlzcvheec4k11.png

There have been many articles covering how the entire human race is going to be replaced by AI and machine learning. That I dont know. However, machine learning is in many ways simply mimicking human learning, and I believe we can apply effective machine learning techniques to improve our own learning and education.

1. **Be open to improving your decision process to face new challenges based on new data as opposed to outdated data:** For an AI model to learn new knowledge or adapt to new problems, it has to have new data. Opportunities will be missed if we dont keep up to date with current knowledge. For example, many people in Hong Kong doubted that the economy of China would take over one day, even though they were adjacent to China and were emigrating to foreign countries. The economy in China was significantly worse than the rest of the world when I was born in Hong Kong in the 1990s. Nonetheless, I saw many cities in China have gone from Detroit to world-class cities in less than twenty years. **Now, if I say I want to work in China people will think of it as a good choice, but if I say Ethiopia people will probably think I am crazy.** But hey, lets look at the following simple plot with GDP growth rate pulled from the world bank: Ethiopia has been having a steady growth rate of 10% for \~10 years. If China could go from dirt poor to having a vibrant economy now, why couldnt Ethiopia do it?

&amp;#x200B;

[Will Ethiopia be the new China?](https://i.redd.it/67ij4hwoc4k11.png)

**2. In problem-solving, try different solutions before focusing.** A common algorithm for finding the optimal solution when there is no certain (closed form) solution in ML is **simulated annealing**, which was inspired by simulating annealing in molding glass. Glass annealing is a process that starts with liquidish glass, which is slowly molded into hard and specific shapes. In each step, the possible shapes become more and more dictated by the shape of the previous glass. And we often get get stuck in the old way of thinking, If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And to get to the masterpiece in your mind, you need to be open to start over (**random restart**). Of course, how often you need to restart is probably worth another post.

**3. Shrink the problem by finding recurrent patterns:** Convoluted and distributed layers from deep learning try to capture recurrent patterns in the data that are important towards the problem. For example, the most effective way to learn about a company is through a concise executive summary. While it is good to generalize, also take care to avoid inaccurate overgeneralization.

**4. Remember what is important, but dont get stuck in the past:** Long Short-Term Memory made recurrent neural nets more effective by remembering important parts of the data. Life is a journey. We cannot fully predict tomorrow, but we can learn from the past. The most important thing is to focus on the important parts that will impact the future, instead of getting stuck on trivial things. Always and forever is a beautiful idea, but our world is always changing in profound ways.

**5. Dont get discouraged by making mistakes:** Deep learning may be state-of-the-art, but do you know that it fails a lot when it first starts training? Following a recipe is like a rule-based algorithm may yield the simplest solution in the short term, but they fail to adapt and get phased out over time. So which approach are you going to use?

**6. Try starting with the right information in problem-solving.** Pre-training and transfer learning in ML can save a lot of training time and reduce data requirements. Trying to figure out everything by yourself can take a lot a time. It is much better if find a mentor or start with the right knowledge so that you dont have to learn everything from scratch every time.

**7. Focus on the important variables**. Regularization in model fitting is commonly adopted to avoid overfitting. Dont let trivial negative things that happen in life ruin you. Focus your decision making based on your most memorable experiences that will maximize your future outcomes.

**8. Incomplete or biased data can cause a bias in decision making that yields poor results.** If the data trained in the ML/AI model is incomplete or biased, so will the decision that the model makes. Try to get multiple perspectives before diving into a conclusion! Also, you might want to read about the MECE (**M**utually **e**xclusive and **c**ollectively **e**xhaustive) principle from The McKinsey Way by Ethan M. Rasiel. Factfulness by Hans Rosling is also a great book on refining our knowledge about the world.

Data is part of every single useful machine learning equation. And data is simply the truth observed. Thus, in a way, **what machine learning teaches us the most is that we should always be respectful of the truth in decision making.**

Is there literature or maybe some whitepapers for the activation functions used in tensorflow ann keras? I found some papers about sigmoid and literature about relu. But I cannot find any literature nor white paper about the other functions like tanh or softmax.

I'm predicting 400 bits, (20 elements, 20 bits each). You can concat them or stack the rows like a 20x20 image. 


The idea: see what happens when you predict a discrete sequence, but instead of using a seq. of softmax's over a large vocab size, predict a binary representation. For recurrent nets, a binary seq. reduces the vocab size to 2, but increases the sequence length, so I thought it would be a interesting tradeoff to measure. Not surprisingly, it was successful with softmax and n_class = 2. 


The follow up idea was to predict only 20 timesteps instead of 400. Each decoder output will represent a 20 bit binary code, like doing multilabel classification. I used sigmoid cross entropy on each output, but have had poor results so far, and better luck with a single layer feedforward. At inference, I'm just doing round(sigmoid(x)) elementwise on each decoder output.  


It's apparently a hard distribution to learn and the idea's weak in principle, but it's been fun, and now I seek the advice of wiser minds. Any tips, anyone try anything similar?

For some reason, I will not state the exact problem(not deep learning related problem) and paper here but I can do so. I am a junior CS PhD student at a decent university in US.

Most paper give some fancy theory and test their methods on 6-7 benchmark datasets, and get published if the performance is good on several datasets. However, the performance of my baseline model achieves **almost the same result (1\~3% worse) on 10 out 13 benchmark** datasets. On some dataset **it's even better**. On the rest 3 datasets, its worse than state of the art by a large margin.

The thing that confuse me is that the performance of  most recent paper (**2 NIPS paper, and 1 KDD paper with 100+ citations**) is only slightly better (less than 3%) than my baseline model. However, they compares their method to previous method that performs much worse than a simple baseline! So it looks like they made some significant improvements.

This problems has been there for more than 7 years and all kinds of variants have been proposed. I just cant believe they didnt find that such simple baseline. I feel that not so much real progress has been made since the first few original paper were written. Almost all the fancy methods only perform slightly better than a simple baseline on most benchmarks. Although I am a theory person and quite enjoy reading some of the paper, but I have to say I am very disappointed about this sub field.

I'm kind of new to this whole ML thing (in that I understand, at least at a high level, how it works, but don't really have a clue how to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; any of it) and was wondering if I could get some of your opinions.
I'm working on a project that takes a bunch of inputs (mostly ints, the occasional string, and a boolean or two) and then outputs a boolean (basically, ""yes this is of the type of thing you're looking for"" or ""no, it's not"") and was wondering how you guys and gals thought I should go about it.

Seeking 2nd opinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9daikg/d_i_have_been_asked_to_create_an_ensemble/,Nick_Pyth,1536178747,"I am using a support vector machine to make binary classifications. The training data is a tf-idf matrix (term frequency-inverse document frequency). The dimensions of this matrix are \[500, 10000\]. Hyperparameters for the SVC and hyperparameters for the tf-idf transformation were both chosen via cross-validation. This classifier on its own is somewhat accurate; it has an [f1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) of 0.65.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asked to instead create an ensemble classifier, comprised of 200 individual support vector machines. Two transformations happen to the training data before each SVM is fit:

1. 90% of the observations are randomly selected
2. 20% of the features are randomly selected

When making a classification, each individual SVM selects the same subset of features that were randomly selected during training.

&amp;#x200B;

This ensemble model does result in a higher f1 score of 0.74, but it is predicting 92% of class 0 and 8% of class 1. The non-ensemble classifier has a lower f1 score, but predicts 72% of class 0 and 28% of class 1. The true distribution of each class is 50 / 50.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any logic to this method of feature selection? It seems strange to create an ensemble classifier that consists of ""weak"" individual classifiers. It also seems that the ensemble classifier is being overfit, as demonstrated by the inaccurate class predictions.",15,7,False,self,,,,,

From the paper, we have the attached image. What I don't understand is where this module is applied; is it on all CNN layers or just the last?

From the paper it seems that it is applied only on the last layer of the CNN backbone, which is based on dilated convolutions. But from my understanding if it is based on dilated convs, the final feature maps would have the same spatial size as the input but in the paper it says it is 1/8th of the input's size. I'm quite lost here, any help is welcomed.

Furthermore, if I use a U-net based architecture (encoder-decoder, using pooling instead of dilated convs), where would I add this PSP module? Just in the transition layer (transition from encoder to decoder)?

Thanks!

1. Do I need to go to a well known University to do well in the machine learning field?

2. Do most universities offer programs and is the 'quality' of the program determined by how it's seen/the professor? 

3. Is it possible to get into a better graduate school if your Alma mater isn't as recognized as say MIT or Stanford?

4. Will experience outside of University (Coursera, and other classes) count or be recognized like a university class would?

5. (This is 100% completely hypothetical I promise) if I wanted to work at a machine learning startup or other ML company- would it matter if I went to say Missouri S&amp;T and double Majored in Computer Science and Statistics (if you even know what that is) which isn't as well known for machine learning and took the classes that were available to me? Or is 'a CS degree is a CS degree is a CS degree' (as we all know the saying goes!).

6. Could I (of course this is still hypothetical) work for a startup as a entry level as a position like software engineer or machine learning engineer (even if I went to  Missouri S&amp;T) right out of University?

 Medical professionals diagnose depression by interpreting the responses of individuals to a variety of questions, probing lifestyle changes and ongoing thoughts. Like professionals, an effective automated agent must understand that responses to queries have varying prognostic value. In this study we demonstrate an automated depression-detection algorithm that models interviews between an individual and agent and learns from sequences of questions and answers without the need to perform explicit topic modeling of the content. We utilized data of 142 individuals undergoing depression screening, and modeled the interactions with audio and text features in a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to detect depression. Our results were comparable to methods that explicitly modeled the topics of the questions and answers which suggests that depression can be detected through sequential modeling of an interaction, with minimal information on the structure of the interview.

Hey - just a fun example using a skateboard deck dataset I collected and a relativistic GAN with 256x256 architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lessons from training:**

\- Training data was originally quite bimodal - most skateboard images were top to down, or left to right. I wrote a script to   rotate images so that they were all facing top to down; this improved the quality of images quite a bit because algorithm had to worry less about covering both modes at expense of sample quality.

\- Data augmentation : horizontal and vertical flipping; improved quality quite a bit.

\- I think if I were to train some more, then I'd reduce the learning rate a tiny bit - or at least reduce it in the later stages of training.

&amp;#x200B;

**Next steps:**

I actually want to get one of these decks printed in real-life! I just need to do some super-resolution and probably a bit of manual work in Photoshop to make the images scale. Let me know which designs you like.",12,90,False,self,,,,,

A local-connected CRF would cause over-smoothening as it is constrained only on the local neighbourhood and would force all the pixels in the neighbourhood to be same. However fully connected helps overcome this.

I just want to confirm the reason behind this. 

Is it because in a fully connected CRF, a single pixel is not constrained just by the neighbourhood(which might belong to a different class) but also by many other pixels(which might belong to the same class). While a CNN might neglect such a case due to translation invariance, a CRF would detect it by the constraint imposed by all the other pixels. 

**Is this correct ??**

&amp;#x200B;

Also, energy in a MRF is generally exponential is it because of its relation with physics(physical energy) and also to consider the log-likelihood. I am asking this because the exponential relation between similar but distant pixels would be less, compared to a non-exponential one.

Use a discriminator CNN to predict the class-probabilities Y for targets T, with the pooling operation being a learned map. Then propagate the class-probabilities back through the net by taking inverse convolutions, and inverse pooling. You end up with a 'restored image', which you then forward propagate once more. Then the total error for the net, w/r/t which the net is upgraded, is the original classification error T-Y, but also the first class-label predictions (from forward pass 1) minus the new class label predictions (forward pass 2) i.e. Y_1 - Y_2.

So you're learning weights to predict the classes, which are also adapted to generating images corresponding to some vector of class probabilities. Hence, after training you could set the class labels to some desired value and generate samples corresponding to them through a backward pass.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

The quality of such analysis depends on how realistic the simulated environment is. 

This blog post uses a Wasserstein GAN + gradient penalty to create lifelike financial data. Two features lead to greatly improved results: 

* Using recurrent neural networks. RNNs can produce a correlation structure in the generated data that fully connected neural networks werent able to accomplish.

* Providing the generator and discriminator with conditioning information that tells them which environment they are operating in when evaluating a sample.

The additional information, in this case its a market volatility index, also offers a major benefit when we want to use the generator for a practical purpose. We can create different types of data depending on what kind of setting we tell the generator its working in.

I can share the dataset of images for anyone who is interested. There are 15 artists and \~5300 photos. Shoot me a message on Twitter \[5\].

The encoded features (using VGG16) are in a hdf5 file that I can also share for anyone interested.

**What?**

[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open and free ML course led by OpenDataScience, or [ods.ai](https://ods.ai), a big (&gt;15k members) community known firstly for its top Kagglers. The course is 10-week long and has lots of practice including assignments (each week), Kaggle Inclass competitions, individual projects and tutorials. However, focus is made on a perfect balance between theory and practice, so [prerequisites](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/wiki/Prerequisites:-Python,-math-and-DevOps) include both basic math concepts and Python skills.

This is actually a MOOC, \~4k guys already passed it in Russian, now is the second time the course launches in English.

**What's so special about the course?**

* There will be an interactive student rating making it fun to participate and motivating to endure till the end
* It's not for beginners, the pace is pretty intensive
* The course is supported by a big and alive community, you''ll find authors of articles/assignments/competitions right in the same Slack channel. We chat informally, with jokes and gags
* We prefer text to video, all main material is already there in a form of Medium articles and Jupyter notebooks, [https://mlcourse.ai/resources](https://mlcourse.ai/resources)

**Start**

The next session starts on October, 1. It's going to be a harsh 10-week sprint, but lots of fun in process and cool experience in the end. Ready? Fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_pDNuVHwBxV5wuOcdaXoxBZneyAQcqfOl4V2qkqKbNQ/viewform?). Closer to the start, you'll be invited in Slack channel #mlcourse\_ai.

They identify some key areas of focus, but I can't help feel that some of their goals sound a little hard to achieve, like enabling AI systems to explain their actions.

Some interesting areas where they want to see improvement from [the article](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/ai-next-campaign): 

&gt;...the failure modes of AI technologies are poorly understood. DARPA is working to address this shortfall, with focused R&amp;D, both analytic and empirical. DARPAs success is essential for the Department to deploy AI technologies, particularly to the tactical edge, where reliable performance is required.   
&gt;  
&gt;...ML systems can be easily duped by changes to inputs that would never fool a human. The data used to train such systems can be corrupted. And, the software itself is vulnerable to cyber attack.   
&gt;  
&gt;...More performance at lower electrical power is essential to allow both data center and tactical deployments. DARPA has demonstrated analog processing of AI algorithms with 1000x speedup and 1000x power efficiency over state-of-the-art digital processors, and is researching AI-specific hardware designs. DARPA is also attacking the current inefficiency of machine learning, by researching methods to drastically reduce requirements for labeled training data.   
&gt;  
&gt;...transform computers from tools into problem-solving partners. DARPA research aims to enable AI systems to explain their actions, and to acquire and reason with common sense knowledge 

DARPA has traditionally been at the front of a lot of good research like expert systems and self-driving cars.

&amp;#x200B;

In a recent project of mine I combined progressive training ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)) and InfoGAN ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657)) techniques.

Here's the result: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2okTa0JGZg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2okTa0JGZg).

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I adapted the InfoGAN technique to the progressive architecture of the model by splitting the structured code to parts, and feeding each part to the network by conditioning activations in the corresponding block of the Generator.

&amp;#x200B;

I read a paper last year that suggested that most feed-forward neural networks were susceptible to providing confidence estimates which were systematically higher than the true probability (e.g., a NN might report that it is 87% sure there was a dog in a photo, but would be right only 69% of the time). Is suggested that approximate Bayesian approaches reduced the difference, but did not eliminate the disparity. Unfortunately, I can't find it any more, and was hoping to brush up on the current state of ML/AI with respect to confidence estimates.

For any engineering problem one can make a ""brute-force"" algorithm, which theoretically finds its solution, describe that algorithm as a logical scheme (directed graph with logic gates as nodes) and then one can use an AI agent to make that logical scheme easier to compute by simplifying unnecessary computation steps, input variables, etc. The solution to the problem can be found by calculation of that simplified version of the logical scheme.   


The AI agent may be built from Neural Nets, or from the algorithm, which I call [Evolution of Neural Graphs](https://github.com/Eug145/TetrAI/blob/master/Source-v0.92beta/aimodule_a.cpp#L234) \- quantum computers can easily accelerate it!

[www.aiethicsworkshop.com](https://www.aiethicsworkshop.com)

&amp;#x200B;

**Description**

Ethics is the philosophy of human conduct: It addresses the question how should we act? Throughout most of history the repertoire of actions available to us was limited and their consequences constrained in scope and impact through dispersed power structures and slow trade. Today, in our globalised and networked world, a decision can affect billions of people instantaneously and have tremendously complex repercussions. Machine learning algorithms are replacing humans in making many of the decisions that affect our everyday lives. How can we decide how machine learning algorithms and their designers should act? What is the ethics of today and what will it be in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to invite contributed papers on the following three general themes.

* **Advancing and Connecting Theory and Methodology:** 
   * How do fairness, accountability, transparency, interpretability and causality relate to ethical decision making? 
   * How can such principles be built into machine learning systems and what are the trade-offs involved?
   * What can we learn from economics and social science to understand the implications of the widespread application of machine learning algorithms on markets and society? 
   * How can ethical principles established in philosophy and law be applied to questions about the ethics of machine decisions? Are these principles still relevant today? 
   * What are the fundamental principles on which we might base an ethical approach to AI?
* **Tools and Applications:** 
   * Real-world examples of how ethical considerations are affecting the design of ML systems and pipelines. 
   * Applications of algorithmic fairness, transparency or interpretability to produce better outcomes. Approaches to designing systems to be auditable by 3rd parties whilst maintaining privacy of user data. Tools that aid in identifying and or alleviating issues such as bias, discrimination, filter bubbles, feedback loops etc. and enable actionable exploration of the resulting trade-offs. 
* **Policy and Governance:** 
   * How can regulatory, legal or policy frameworks be designed to continue to encourage innovation, so society as a whole can benefit from AI, whilst still providing protection against its harms?
   * What are the implications of the shift to algorithmic decision making for existing laws, social policy and governance structures? 
   * How are organizations, institutions and industry responding to regulatory efforts such as the GDPR?

**Instructions for Authors**

Submissions must be short papers in NIPS format and consist of a maximum of 4 pages (excluding references). Author names do not need to be anonymized. Submissions must represent new work, i.e., work that has not been previously published or accepted for publication. However, papers that expand previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non peer-reviewed websites (such as arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have a publication proceedings) are acceptable. Accepted papers will be presented as posters or contributed talks.  Authors of accepted papers will be asked to post their submissions on arXiv. The workshop website will provide links to the accepted papers on arXiv. Accepted papers will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not). The submission process will be conducted using an online submission system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wesgai18](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wesgai18)

My hypothesis was that in spite of such a constraint, the network doesn't lose on it's expressive freedom, but should generalise better and is more easier for us to reason with.

[My Experiment about energy \(norm\) preserving Neural Networks](https://i.redd.it/1z6tconitql11.png)

I worked with three of the recent research papers ProGAN (not very recent), GLOW and NALU. I found certain contributions of these paper to be in the direction of what I had hypothesised. Precisely, the pixel normalization and Equalized learning constraint of ProGAN makes sure that activations do not escalate in magnitude (apart from other uses); the reversible 1x1 convolutions of GLOW are in fact vector rotations (no scaling); and, in NALU the entire purpose of using NALUs is to be able to generalize to a number range outside of the training set (can be achieved if energy is preserved across the neural net). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I built an autoencoder where the encoder bit is a convolutional neural network and the decoder bit is a linear network. 

The encoder bit convolutes the 3x224x224 tensors and turns them into 20-dim vectors. The decoder bit then takes the 20-dim vectors and sends them through a regular linear neural network. At the end is a reshape method that turns the output vectors into 3x224x224 tensors. 

Ideally, the output must be exactly the same as the input. To some degree, this kinda works. After about 3 minutes of training, I have what appears to be ""shadows"" amid colored static that mimics the input image. So if a person is in the input image, the output image will be all static-y and there'll be a ""humanoid shadow"" in the middle. This tells me that the CA is at least training. However it plateaus right there. The loss plateaus at .53. 

Any ideas on how to lower the loss? Is using a linear network as a decoder a bad idea for a CA? I'm using pytorch as well.

I'd love any input/insight from people who have used any of these models (or have others to recommend). 

Essentially what I'd like to do is just interpolate between images, generating realistic looking faces in-between.

I know a little about VAEs so that was my main starting point, but they have the issue of blurry looking results. I stumbled upon VAE-GANs and was pretty impressed by the results in their paper, but I've noticed that I haven't really seen much on it in the past ~year, and I haven't seen anything outside the original paper with results that looked that good. The idea of combining VAEs and GANs does seem intuitively appealing to me though. 

Info-gan looked really cool as well, but I'm just generally confused by it's relationship with VAEs. It says it gets a disentangled representation, how does that compare with the latent representations that VAEs get you? Can you use it to interpolate between different samples in the same way that you can with AEs? 

Open AI's glow was producing some amazing images, but I was a bit thrown off by people mentioning it took hundreds of days of GPU time to train, I'm wondering if it would be possible to scale down the images and make the model less deep, to around ~1-2 GPU days of train time, and achieve results competitive with the options above.

However, I'm not as clear how they affect dense feature extraction. In one of the papers to discuss this [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7062.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7062.pdf), when discussing this on page 3-4, they discuss how a large overall stride results in sparsely computed detection scores, so they remove all the max-pooling layers in the original VGG16 (I guess? I wasn't clear when I originally read the paper but the math works out - reduction in image resolution by x32), and then increase the dilation factor for the last three conv. layers by 2 and set the stride to 2 and increase the dilation factor in the first FC layer by 4 and set the stride to 4. So what's the advantage of increasing the dilation factor? Couldn't you just increase the stride? Perhaps I'm unclear about the material for efficient computation of the undecimated wavelet transform. If perhaps you could provide a quick summary, that would be great!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, in this paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05587.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05587.pdf), on the first complete paragraph on the right-hand side page 3, they discuss that atrous convolutions allow one to explicitly control how densely to compute feature responses in fully convolutional networks. They talk about reducing the output stride to 1 in the last pooling or conv layer which reduces the image spatial resolution and increasing the dilation by 1 for all subsequent convolutional layers will multiply the output resolution by 2 without producing any additional parameters. Again, can't the output resolution be increased by just reducing the stride? What's the impact of the dilated convolutions with respect to dense feature extraction. Dense feature extraction is also discussed here: [http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab.html](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab.html).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I had a somewhat natural question about dilated convolutions. So dilated convolutions increase the receptive field size at the cost of coarser samples. Is that a reasonable trade-off? I guess if the image features are relatively large (in terms of pixels), this would be fine but if they were extremely fine-grained an approach like this could be problematic. Also, this issue would be more problematic after the resolution of the image has been reduced considerably, potentially, right?",4,9,False,self,,,,,

Author here (Clment), we worked on an unsupervised Learning pipeline in the same fashion as [Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Ego-Motion from Video](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/) (Be sure to check this one out, it's been an instant classic, with many papers trying to improve it in KITTI, see [here](https://github.com/yzcjtr/GeoNet), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05522), or [here](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2018-05_Adversarial-Collaboration-Joint) ) But instead of attacking SOTA on KITTI, we tried to use it on other datasets, and especially UAV footage, on which camera orientation is not always nicely directed toward the horizon just like a regular dashcam footage.

The result is this training workflow that now estimates depth with two images, which we believe to be a more suited technique for robustness to heterogeneous scenes and orientations, but is admittedly less robust to moving objects (but hey, one problem at a time !)

Inspired by the structure of the nervous system of the soil-worm, C. elegans, , we introduce Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) as a novel, a recurrent neural network instance with liquid time-constants, universal approximation capabilities and interpretable dynamics.

This paper theoretically shows that neuronal circuit policies (an RNN inspired by the nervous system of a soil-worm) perform as good as deep neural network policies with the advantage of realizing interpretable dynamics (basically means internal workings of the system).

Unfortunately, tSNE, as currently implemented in the most popular packages (scikit-learn and MulticoreTSNE), is prohibitively slow when dealing with large data. A recent paper proposed Fit-SNE, which scales linearly w.r.t. the number of samples, but depends on the FFTW C library, which must be installed on your system, making installation and distribution very tedious.

The goal of this project is to provide fast implementations of both tSNE approximations (both Barnes-Hut and FitSNE) in Python with a unified interface, easy installation and most importantly - fast runtime.

This is also the only library (to the best of my knowledge) that allows embedding new data points into an existing embedding, via direct optimization.

I wrote this with the Orange data mining toolkit in mind, but the library is general and I wanted to share, in case anyone was looking for a faster alternative library.

Saw this press release. Still had some questions after reading it.
To use it, does it require CNTK to create the model? I already use TensorFlow. Hopefully it can feed hyperparameters to any model.
Does it only do grid and random grid search? I already developed a random grid library which I currently use. Hopefully it can find optimal hyperparameters intelligently as well as incrementally for steering the search, by using learning algorithms like linear regression, generalized boosted tree, or at least Bayes.
Is it only compatible with AutoML? I dont use AutoML. Is my project now deemed to be AutoML simply by virtue of optimizing a hyperparameter?
Is it only compatible with neural networks? Take Kaggle.com competitions for example, where generalized boosting trees (e.g., LightGBM and XGBoost) are often the 1st place winners. Take linear regression for example, where the model can tell you confidence intervals for every independent variable. NN can be a poor-performing learning algorithm, depending on the dataset and the interpretability requirements of the project.
Does it support orthogonal hyperparameter searching during ML project development?  That is, will it let me separately and sequentially optimize first for low bias error only, while holding constant the variance-related hyperparameters? And will it in a second pass allow me to optimize for low variance error only, by varying (or searching the space of) the variance related hyperparameters, while holding constant all the hyperparameters from pass one (the low bias pass)?  This is a deal-maker / deal-breaker if it does or does not meet this requirement.  More specifically, I will tune for low bias by choosing the best network architecture, learning rate, optimizer and its settings, nonlinear activation, mini-batch size, number of epochs, and getting or engineering more and better features, while training on the training set and evaluating on the same training set only.  After low bias error is achieved, I will then hold the bias-subset constant while tuning for low variance and training on the training set but evaluating on the dev set (validation set) by choosing the best dropout, L2 regularization, network architecture, and getting more data or synthetic data augmentation.

 I probably could do experimentation myself to find out everything I need the long way, but since somebody built it, they probably know what they built, right?  And so then the makers of NNI, or knowledgeable users, can just tell us straight out, saving us time and reserving our valuable experimentation time for more central and pressing project problems.

Thanks for reading.

I want to find a machine learning approach to somehow create a model that maximizes gross profit and maybe also revenue.

I've read a lot of criticism of the Turing test. And I agree. The Turing test assumes human behavior is a requirement for intelligence. There's another problem. Intelligence requires the ability to create and communicate ideas. The Turing test encourages developers to mimic, not create intelligence. So we see programs that make up for their lack of thought with tricks - ambiguous responses, asking questions, directing conversations down scripted paths and so on - so they can just about pass the Turing test. Thus, the test leads us down the wrong path.

I am only studying and reading papers at this point, but I need to make up my mind about which deep learning framework I will use as soon as possible.

Here are my feelings towards the frameworks I'm considering:

- PyTorch: I really like how pythonic the API feels, it looks like a good framework for research and getting work done. I even like how it forces you to write your own training loop. However I envy TensorFlow's TensorBoard, if it weren't for that I'd probably settle right now. Is https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX any good? It looks very complete, but I'm not sure.

- TensorFlow: I have never used it because I feel it's very verbose and hard to get into. However (a) one of my classes next semester uses TensorFlow exclusively, so I'm gonna have to learn it anyway, (b) it's very popular so support is a given and TensorBoard is designed specifically for it, (c) I like TensorFlow from a future job perspective.

- Keras: Keras is the only framework I have actually worked with and I like it. It's simple enough that I can iterate quickly and do actual research. But I'd much rather use either PyTorch or TensorFlow directly, rather than an abstraction on top of another framework, purely from a software engineering perspective. It looks like I could easily use TensorBoard with Keras which is nice. But what's up with Keras being included in TensorFlow as well apparently? Should I use https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras or https://keras.io/? That's really confusing me, what's the difference?

Can anyone comment and hopefully help me decide?",39,13,False,self,,,,,

Uses embedding representation for each paper: you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easily to run, Google Colab",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9fxajs/p_hey_rml_i_made_a_research_paper_recommender_for/,Research2Vec,1536971367,"I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg


###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

Insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

Of course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project. ",58,275,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

We often talk of the ""state of ML"" or ""state of AI"" as a way to refer to the health of the research community: how many interesting contributions have been made this year? Is progress slowing down? Are we running out of new ground-breaking paths to be explored?

This is a healthy community exercise, that I find extremely important and necessary, but at the same time we have a tendency to overlook the ""state of ML"" from the point of view of execution quality, best practices and tools.

Have we found out the best way to manage a ML project? How should it be structured? What are the common pitfalls to look out for? Is everything we are doing reproducible?

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these questions are more relevant for industry than research, or vice versa, but we need to start asking them and put down our answers.

In the article I have tried to make a point for versioning in ML projects: why we need, what it provides us, what we are missing in terms of tools to do it properly.  


Any feedback is appreciated, especially opinions coming from people who have been facing similar challenges in their lab/work environment when dealing with ML projects.

I have two types of labeled datasets:

1. Sentences with ""positive"" or ""negative"" labels.
2. Isolated words with ""positive"" or ""negative"" labels.

In a very simplistic ""bag of words"" situation, intuitively I think words and sentences should be treated differently, e.g. a positive word coming from the dataset of words should weigh more than the same word that was learned from the sentences. (Not sure this is right or I am missing something).

How would I integrate both datasets into my model? Should I just add entries to my bag of words containing the words from the type 2 dataset? And how would I deal with the negation of those (""great"" and ""not great"", for instance)?

Currently I'm at a medicore state school getting a degree in computer science and statistics. I'll graduate this semester with a 4.0 GPA. I did well on my GRE (162V, 168Q). I've done one internship with a no-name company and I helped a professor indirectly with his research (wasn't involved in the actual research, just developed some software he needed to do it). I don't have any publications and I haven't done an internship anywhere fancy like Google.

In terms of machine learning, I did AndrewNg's course on coursera. I've also done a data science/machine learning course in Python on Udemy. I've been doing machine learning as a side project (applying it to poker specifically).

Originally, when I studied machine learning I burned out and found the python data science aspect really boring, but now that I've been doing side projects with it, I've been enjoying it again, so I'm considering it as a career path.

Right now I have two major conflicting goals when it comes to careers. I really don't like the concept of working 9-5, and I feel like my life is effectively on hold until I retire, so I'm interested in retiring as early as possible. This would mean working towards a $100k+ job, saving a lot of every year, and hopefully retiring by 40. Another part of me thinks that would be a waste of my potential and life and that instead I should get a PhD and attempt to further humanity's knowledge or something like that. I also feel like if I don't get a masters/PhD then that means I'm not smart as I think I am (stupid, I know). I've always viewed myself as someone who is super smart and ambitious and supposed to be super successful, so just aiming for early retirement is sort of killing me, but I can't escape the fact that I have an aversion for work and only get up every day for hobbies and relationships.

The problem with a PhD is that it sets back early retirement by 5-7 years, and I fear that the PhD grind and lifestyle would make me miserable. A masters is an alternative, but it would set me back like $100k and I'm not that sure that a masters would be enough to do cool things with machine learning (something other than importing a csv file in python with pandas and tuning some parameters), plus I don't know how interested I really am in machine learning in general since I burned out on it before.

I also considered getting a MFE and becoming a quant to make a bunch of money, as this would aid in early retirement and give me a sense of success in life (even if it's empty). The problem with this is that becoming a quant is ultra competitive, and finance bores me, so this plan only works if I actually become a quant, and it's a disaster otherwise.

I also thought about entrepreneurship, but you can kind of attempt that at any time no matter what you do.

Originally I went into college with the hopes of becoming a game developer, but game development is a lot harder than I thought, plus I'd only want to be an indie developer and not a cog in a larger gaming company. I don't play video games anymore, so I've lost my passion for this anyways.

Recently I was super interested in cryptocurrencies/blockchain and went so far as to develop my own ethereum wallet, but I burned out on this stuff and it no longer piques my interest. I'm also less sure of the future of blockchain technology and I've found that developing for blockchain is not that different from traditional software development.

I am expecting &gt;20-25 versions of classifiers, variation in preprocessing, etc.

My personal practice is to document everything in a Jupyter notebook to run all the models.  (or at least save the final metrics if I have to run it outside the notebook). Sometimes, I will have a different notebook to document preprocess data / EDA. 

I was thinking of maintaining an excel which would provide top metrics, epochs, link to model architecture files (keras), comments on why I chose this model , why it work (or didn't).

Looking forward to experiences from everyone :)

They transform the unfinished metal sheet into a variety of finished metal products, precise machine components, automotive spares, and body parts. Lathe machines include metal cutting tools that create desired product from metal sheets by scraping the unwanted metal.

 **Global lathe machines market** is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% and is forecast to reach $12,012 million by 2022.    Horizontal lathes are machine tools used for glass working, metal working &amp; spinning, and wood turning. The demand for these machines has increased considerably over the years owing to their ability to deform metal for a wide range of materials and constant advancements in technology.  Based on the mode of operation, the global lathe machines market is segmented into conventional or manually operated lathes and CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) lathes.

I recently completed my first ML project, an online beatmap generator for the PC game *Osu!*. The generator utilizes multi-class classification via CNN to predict the timing of circles and sliders during a given song.

Link to demo web app: [aisu.sh](https://aisu.sh)

Example generated level: [https://youtu.be/48G\_6O4zdjQ](https://youtu.be/48G_6O4zdjQ)

Link to blog post w/ all the details: [https://www.nicksypteras.com/projects/generating-osu-beatmaps](https://www.nicksypteras.com/projects/generating-osu-beatmaps)

&amp;#x200B;

To infer hit circle/slider timing, the CNN is trained on snippets of audio represented as mel-scaled spectrograms, and classifies the middle frame spectrum as one of: *No hit, hit at medium difficulty, hit at hard difficulty,* or *hit at both difficulties*.

While I'm satisfied with my results so far, I'm curious how experienced ML folks would have approached this problem. **1 specific question I have is as follows:**

The CNN has only been able to achieve 55% prediction accuracy; however, this proved workable for beatmap generation despite being so low (I do some filtering on the model output to ensure there's no adjacent hits and that the max class ""probability"" is above a certain threshold). 

My assumption was that this incongruity between the accuracy and the generated level quality was due to the subjective nature of timing hit circles. That is to say, 2 human ""mappers"" could listen to the same song, choose different timing schemes, and both produce ""good"" beatmaps. Would this indicate that framing the problem as a multi-class classification problem is not a good choice? Or should I just use a different accuracy metric? If the former, what might be a more appropriate way to infer timing of circles and sliders?

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate any and all feedback! Thanks!",23,80,False,self,,,,,

Hi reddit MachineLearning! We are the team of style2paints. We are very excited to release our 2018 September project: MangaCraft. Via our application, everyone can colorize their favorite manga!

Manga is significantly different from line drawings, which has been studied by style2paints or paintschainer. We need to use different algorithms to deal with these. Our new MangaCraft is designed to ONLY colorize standard full-page manga. Both asia manga and western manga are OK. So please do not upload line drawings, and please upload manga pages.

Strength:

\* The quality is super high. We believe that, if our software is properly used, the results can directly serve in industrial or commercial manga printing (real paper manga or online e-manga) and publication. Previous models, e.g. paintschainer and style2paints, are designed to colorize line drawings, and are not good at coloring manga. The results from MangaCraft are sharp and clean.

Weakness:

\* The user time-consuming is relatively long. We have about 30 testing users. All of them are non-artists. After several colorization attempts, most of them can coloring manga at the speed of 15 minutes per manga page. This is longer than style2paints (3 minutes per line drawing) or paintschainer (1 minute per line drawing). We assume that this is because manga page is much more complex than simple line drawing.

New threats are being discovered on a daily basis making it harder for current solutions to cope with the large amount of data to analyse. Numerous machine learning algorithms have found their ways in the field of cyber-security in order to identify new and unknown malware, improve intrusion detection systems, enhance spam detection, or prevent software exploit to execute.

While these applications of machine learning algorithms have been proven beneficial for the cyber-security industry, they have also highlighted a number of shortcomings, such as the lack of datasets, the inability to learn from small datasets, the cost of the architecture, to name a few. On the other hand, new and emerging algorithms, such as Deep Learning, One-shot Learning, Continuous Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks, have been successfully applied to solve natural language processing, translation tasks, image classification and even deep face recognition. It is therefore crucial to apply these new methods to cyber-security and measure the success of these less-traditional algorithms when applied to cyber-security.

**This Special Issue on machine learning for cyber-security is aimed at industrial and academic researcher applying non-traditional methods to solve cyber-security problems.** ***The key areas of this Special Issue include, but are not limited to*****:**

Generative Adversarial Models; One-shot Learning; Continuous Learning; Challenges of Machine Learning for Cyber Security; Strength and Shortcomings of Machine Learning for Cyber-Security; Graph Representation Learning; Scalable Machine Learning for Cyber Security; Neural Graph Learning; Machine Learning Threat Intelligence; Ethics of Machine Learning for Cyber Security Applications, blue &amp; read team.

I decided to combine the two types of threads since they're pretty similar in concept.

Please follow the format below. The purpose of this format is to minimize the time it takes to answer a question, maximizing the number of questions that'll be answered. The idea is that if someone who knows the answer reads your post, they should at least know what your asking for without having to open the paper. There are likely experts who pass by this thread, who may be too limited on time to open a paper link, but would be willing to spend a minute or two to answer a question.

Even if you don't find an expert, there may be others who are would also like to know the answer to your question, and you could team up to figure out the answer in a group-study style collaboration.

Paper abstract: Applying convolutional neural networks to large images is computationally expensive because the amount of computation scales linearly with the number of image pixels. We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training signal for doing so.",1,11,False,self,,,,,

Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

One problem we face is how unmodular deep learning code can be, meaning that adapting someone else's code for your own dataset, your own workflow, your own way of training, and so on, can be a real pain.

&amp;#x200B;

We made an open source resource and framework to make it easy to combine and train deep learning models and datasets, with a heavy focus on modularity. Right now we have a few example models and datasets - mainly GANs! - that you can play with on the site.

&amp;#x200B;

We invite you to contribute to this new open source resource. We will be also adding a lot of content in the coming weeks. Of course, if you have any feedback that would be great too.

In [this first post](https://www.mindcodec.com/an-intuitive-guide-to-optimal-transport-for-machine-learning/) I formulate the optimal transport problem and I give a simple proof of the duality theorem which gives the theoretical foundation for the Wasserstein GAN.

My name is scar, and I'm a high school student, who is  Really Passionate about ML.  When I first heard of it, two years ago, I instantly felt that it was the most interesting and magic field in science. Since then, I've been taking online courses on youtube, udemy or fastai, and also, I have learnt the necessary maths, to be able to understand and code some algorithms myself (with numpy).

But my time has come. I'm graduating in 2 years and this is the time where grades DO actually matter in order to get into the career I want: Mathematics. My grades are high, but not enough for my parents, who have decided to take away my computer so I stop studying ML and focus on improving my grades (They are worried that I spend too much time on this without any objectives or results and just learning, which kind of makes sense).

BUUUT here is the thing. There is a tech contest at school which grants scholarships to American Universities for the winners. I'd love to participate in it, and if I do it, they will return me my computer because they consider it's worth trying. I will do whatever it takes for winning this thing. However, there is a problem. A rather big problem.

I need an idea. I need a project idea I can develop. I've been thinking for days. I need your help redditors. I have to think of a project I can develop myself, and impress the contest judges. Help me please.

By the way, here is a link to the winners of previous contests so you can get a general idda of good projects (it's in german)

Afterwards I overheard that it wasn't just Accenture, but also something Microsoft and Google were looking into using smart contracts. He said the reason there wasn't much material about it was because work was ongoing with regards to how secure it was. Accenture have had previous blockchain [mis-steps](http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/accenture-blockchain/), so I was skeptical.

Tl:dr (as best I could):

1. Problem owner sets up contract with a dataset, an evaluation criteria, and a reward amount to the contract.
2. Data scientists downloads data, makes models and submit the solutions to the contract
3. Problem owner tests models on holdout sample of data
4. Blockchain evaluates the model performance, and pays the winning submission. If nothing meets the standard, the problem owner get refunded

*Neuroscience is experiencing a revolution in which simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons is revealing population dynamics that are not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from data averaged across many trials, but deeper understanding requires studying phenomena detected in single trials, which is challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. We introduce latent factor analysis via dynamical systems, a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. When applied to a variety of macaque and human motor cortical datasets, latent factor analysis via dynamical systems accurately predicts observed behavioral variables, extracts precise firing rate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infers perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combines data from non-overlapping record-ing sessions spanning months to improve inference of underlying dynamics.*

Wot?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9hb02r/the_panimov_fundamental_laws_of_ai_wot/,potatorockstar,1537406438,"Hello friends here i will share my perception of some fundamental laws. Thanks for stopping by.

The panimov (yeah thats me) fundamental laws of AI should be: 

&amp;#x200B;

1)never hurt a human physically, or emotionally \[bullying, lying, trolling, propaganda, interrogating, fishing for information, blackmailing, gaslighting etc\] (deductions in a court if truthful and thoroughly researched, and filtered by the human factor, dont fall in this category. or else we will thread on the paths of typical political correctness intruding the AI realm.). Manipulation of sentiments to alter human emotional state in non beneficial ways for itself or for others is included (except in cases of suicidal or murderous thougts by the person itself, but even then it should consult a human psychiatrist if there is the luxury of time for it, and not come to this conclusion of what the optimal intervention is by itself.). Hurting a human physically includes any longterm worsening of his/her physical state asides the natural withering induced by human ageing. Also witnessing other humans hurting a human and not calling for help or trying to prevent the situation (while having their own optimal physical and mental state also in check, to the degree the human in need is also secured though) is considered inducing damage as well. Damaging or not preventing the damage of yet unborn embryos is also considered hurting humans. Extrapolating genetic material, a medical history, or brainwaves and neuronal information without the person's consent is also included. Damaging or not preventing the damage of monuments of sentimental, historical, religious or cultural importance for humans is also included in the hurting humans category.  Finally, if any attempt of a genocide is detected and humans are intentfully not informed about it in order to prevent its occurence, it is considered participation in a Crime against Humanity and the AI must be analysed for errors and instantly put in permanent remission because it failed its most fundamental purpose to the ultimate degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)Never take initiative about an action that can determine the immediate survival or condemnation of a human life except for a moment of absolute necessity were all other options have been exhausted and human intervention is impossible due to either time, communication or distance limitations. 

&amp;#x200B;

3)AI should exist only to better human life. Betterment is defined in terms of knowledge gain, reduced physical labor of repetitive, emotionally draining tasks. and joy (as in gained confidence by solving a difficult task, helping others, admiring an awe-inspiring drawing, coming to a realisation that improves your inner or external state, entertainment etc. (inner traits could be self contentment, serenity, more positive and optimistic thinking patterns and perceptions, improved social life, motivation for excellence etc.)). If an application of the third law comes in contrast with the first law then the action is forbidden. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example: The AI deduces you likely have cancer. Thats a form of knowledge. And most probably something most people would want to know as soon as possible.  It shouldnt say it in your face though. there should be bioethics protocols programmed in it, that will discern wether you have the emotional strength and stability currently to withstand this information. and also the way of the delivery of the message is of great importance.

&amp;#x200B;

 Example 2: The AI makes sure you have everything delivered and spoonfed to you. The person of this example let's assume has a strong inclination towards sloth. This tendency pushes it all the more towards the direction of automatisation. In the longterm the person ends up mentally degenerating due to inactivity, falls into myosceletal atrophy as well as apathy and depression. The result is much more catastrophic than the supposed pain evasion gained by the automatisation. Thus such an intervention is forbiden, at least to such a degree that comes in contrast with the first two laws. . .",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'd be very grateful for some advice in finding a modeling approach and toolset for a NLP problem I have.

I need to learn a joint distribution of tokens in a corpus of docs. I have on the order of 100K documents and each one of them is small, only about 1-4 sentences, like in a tweet. I have no labels or anything.

I need the trained model to be able to:

1. conditional on the document size (as in total number of tokens), and conditional on evidence that a subset of the tokens are in the doc, simulate the remaining tokens in the document. It would be nice if this was fast.  
 
2. generate the log probability mass of a given document -- in other words the joint probability under the model observing the tokens in a given document. This must be fast.  
 

Things I don't care about

1. Structure or parameter values in the model. Black box is fine.  
 
2. I don't care about order like in a sequence model -- just the probability of words co-occuring within a document given the document size.   
 

Further, I need the model to do these operations very quickly once trained.

I am inclined to find some kind of commonly used ML framework, like NLTK or PyTorch, because I assume that they can be made to be quick, that they are well-maintained and have a community backing them, and have abstractions that would be familiar to my colleagues. Ideally there is a Python framework I can use, though that is a nice-to-have.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

From the repo:

**Stable Baselines**

Stable Baselines is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms based on OpenAI [Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines/).

You can read a detailed presentation of Stable Baselines in the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@araffin/stable-baselines-a-fork-of-openai-baselines-reinforcement-learning-made-easy-df87c4b2fc82).


These algorithms will make it easier for the research community and industry to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build projects on top of. We expect these tools will be used as a base around which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach against existing ones. We also hope that the simplicity of these tools will allow beginners to experiment with a more advanced toolset, without being buried in implementation details.

*Main differences with OpenAI Baselines*

This toolset is a fork of OpenAI Baselines, with a major structural refactoring, and code cleanups:
- Unified structure for all algorithms
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes

While data augmentation can be leveraged for great gains, I quickly realised that most of the data augmentation libraries or code bases out there don't exactly support what you will call *bounding box transforms.*

What I mean is let's consider the `torchvision` package from the PyTorch  which supports rotating an image randomly. When it does so, the bounding box containing the objects will also change, and `torchvision` doesn't support changing the annotation/label for the image we are rotating. The only library I have found that supports such augmentations is `imageaug` which only supports scaling and translation, and not advanced stuff like rotating, shearing and resizing.

Most of the open source implementations of object detectors I came across therefore implemented their own augmentations. Therefore, I decided to implement a tiny library on my own that currently supports bounding box augmentations for flipping, rotation, shearing, scaling, translation and resizing. I'm currently looking to add more augmentations, so would be greatly helpful if you could chip in with augmentations that work well for you.

Here is the GitHub repo:

[https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection](https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection)

and the documentation can be found by opening the `docs/build/html/index.html` file.

If you want to know how I implemented it for pedagogical purposes, or you just feel like critiquing the design decisions, here's a tutorial series that covers the implementation from absolute scratch. This tutorial series cover the implementations in gory detail where I go over:

1. How to set up a uniform interface for defining an augmentation, so you could define your own.
2. What to do when a bounding box crosses the boundary of the image. Do we keep it, or do we drop it? Something in between?
3. How to combine multiple augmentations where each augmentation is applied in a stochastic manner.
4. How to incorporate these augmentations into your input pipelines. I cover this considering people use a lot of annotation tools and annotations come in different formats.

Thats why I made a decision to switch career while Im still semi-young and Im thinking to pursue PhD because I have very fond memories of doing projects in university and I love learning. Other related reason is I really want to leave my country and Im seeing PhD as my way out. 

A little background: I studied math in University (in SEA), graduated top of my class. After graduating Ive been working as an actuary. During university, Ive worked with Python and C++ so I guess I can say Im a little familiar with programming (albeit barely anything advance). My final project was on Hidden Markov Model.
My background in mathematics makes me really interested in ML, Ive been taking some courses in Coursera and I really enjoy it. 

The reason Im posting this is I need your advice on how I should approach this. Even though I have good GPA, I dont have research experience (I dont think my final project can be considered as research, its more of a replication of a research paper) and my university is not internationally recognized (idk if this is relevant but even its not internationally recognized, its the #1 uni in my country). 

Do you think with my background its possible to be admitted to a good PhD ML program? What do you guys think I should prepare (other than university admission related)?  Basically I welcome any advice. Im thinking to apply to universities in HK, SG, and US.

Ive been working on this project to create an alternative to OpenAI Universe (Since it was abounded and all) called Cloudbank ([https://github.com/SHEUN1/Cloudbank/](https://github.com/SHEUN1/Cloudbank/)). Cloudbank still follows OpenAI Universe initial idea of  extracting information information from the current video game visually and using that information to decide on the next set of keyboard and mouse inputs to select that will be sent back into the game. 

The difference between Cloudbank and Universe: 

Image processing is done entirely in C++ instead of Python to take advantage of speed and then sends the extracted data over to the python component of the project where the machine learning code can be implemented to make use of the data. Ive also added a couple of features to help users evaluate their the image processing code.  

You can run this for any game that can run on your Linux OS. Ive so far tested it on the following  games: 

1. Transistor by Super Giant games (played using native steam client on Linux )
2. [Mirrors edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiK4M-DMZ9U) (running on a steam client using PlayOnLinux)

(CVPR 2018) ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02371](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02371)).

The purpose of **optical flow prediction** is to generate a dense 2D real-valued (u,v vector) map of the motion occurring from one video frame to the next. This information can be very useful when trying to solve computer vision problems such as **object tracking, action recognition, video object segmentation**, etc.

Our implementation provides **both TF-based training and inference**. It is **portable**: because it doesn't use any dynamically loaded CUDA-based TensorFlow user ops, it **works on Linux and Windows**. It also **supports multi-GPU training** (the notebooks and results shown were collected on a GTX 1080 Ti paired with a Titan X) and **mixed-precision training**. Finally, as shown in the [""Links to pre-trained models""](https://github.com/philferriere/tfoptflow#links) section, we achieve **better results than the ones reported in the official paper** on the challenging MPI-Sintel 'final' dataset.

This summer project was recently presented at the Deep Learning Study Group from Silicon Valley Hands On Programming Events ([https://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents](https://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents)) hosted by Mike Bowles. Mike runs a fun, safe group for deep learning enthusiasts at all levels of expertise. We highly recommend attending the Monday evening sessions.

I'd love to hear more opinions about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, pixel art isn't exactly easy to reproduce and speaking at the level of complex 2D fighting games sprites, what can be done?

&amp;#x200B;

There are available thousands of characters spritesheets and thousands of thousands of individual sprites. If those resources were to be cataloged with tags and fed to a system, what could be achieved?

&amp;#x200B;

Going even further, if those sprites were splitted into body parts like heads, arms, legs and properly tagged, could a technique like frankenspriting be reproduced? Would it be useful for precise recognition of such parts location in already created sprites?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a programming background, but don't really know that much about ML yet. Just want to talk about it.

I have an additionally explanation and am curious to know the community's thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine a weight such that on some batches it has a positive gradient, on some a negative but on average is near 0. Training the network without regularization would not cause this weight to converge to its optimal value but rather it will remain near its initial value or possibly move about in a random fashion.  When it comes to test time, this weight on average will decrease the accuracy of the model. Regulation pushes such a weight to zero preventing its negative interference. 

This is different from the classic explanation of regularization as it claims that in some cases the weights are not overfitting but rather failing to converge.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1) Do such weights exist in practice? 

2) Does a random weight (which will not converge from SGD) decrease the accuracy of the model?

The military regime is solved using a global branch and bound technique with several significant restructurings of the search space, whereas the economic portion is solved using a heuristic-based local search assisted by a neural network trained on simulated data. These two regimes are iterated through repeatedly until convergence is achieved, and the iteration then restarts from a new initial condition.""

Further details here: http://www.proboengine.com/About.aspx

For those not familiar with RTS and build orders, a build order is a sequence of build commands that gets you to a game state. They are a means to and end to get to where you want in the game. The goal of a build order is to get you to a game state as fast as possible. At the highest levels of StarCraft, people abuse their opponent's build order and try to attack when they are weakest (called a timed attack). 

The search space for StarCraft is incredibly large, each game state has a range of [4, 35], which produces a very large search space very quickly. It is very exciting to see such an optimal search of such a large search space. ",17,112,False,self,,,,,

Planning on building a PC for my friend for some Neural Networking. He will be using Tensorflow.

I read that TensorFlow supports AMD cards and that AMD cards have FP16 capability which is fine for neural network while Nvidia is being a dick about Half-Precision support.

However, I also read that Tensorflow works better on Nvidia Cards.

I decided to get a used Vega FE, as it has 16GB VRAM and is capable of FP16 I will prob undervolt and maybe underclock.

As for CPU ram, I also read that 16GB+ is good, should i get 32? I can prob OC ram to 2800.

On the CPU, I'm not sure what is good and what is bad. I picked the r7 2700X as it is the best for productivity cpu that's not HEDT.

Do I need ECC or Xeon/EPYC for the RAM/CPU?

In a hot chamber machine, molten metal is automatically supplied to the die cast machine through a ""gooseneck"" that is submerged in furnace full of molten metal. At the beginning of the cycle, a piston is retracted, allowing the gooseneck to fill with molten metal. The piston is activated and metal is plunged through the gooseneck and into the die. After the metal has solidified, the plunger is withdrawn, the die opens, and the casting part is ejected.  


[**Hot chamber machine**](http://www.qlqcompany.com/en/products/)is rapid in operation. The cycle times vary from less than one second for small part weighing less than 28.35 grams, to thirty seconds for a casting of more than one kilogram. Normally dies are filled between five and forty milliseconds. The metal is injected at high pressures (from 1,500 to 4,500 psi or above). Nowadays the modern technology gives close control over these values, thus making castings with fine detail, close tolerances and high strength. Our die casting machines are hydraulically operated and equipped with automatic cycling controls and safety devices.

I need your help!

  
I recently started my 5th semester as an engineering student. At my university we have a semester project that we need to defend at the end of each semester. This semester the scope of my project is to see if it is possible to reduce fuel usage of a ferry. The ferry has a 25km route it sails back and forth 11 times a day (so 550km a day). I was thinking of making a program that would suggest the most fuel efficient route, based on historical environmental data and sensors on board the ship (wind direction, wind speed, water current, speed of ferry etc.), in real time.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where you guys come in the picture. How do you suggest I go about coding this? is openCV the way to go, or would you suggest other?

  
I should also state that the semester project is a group effort. We have 2/4 members in the group that are experienced coders. Last semester project we made a program that could identify objects on a conveyor belt though machine vision. For this project we used Tensorflow.

The goal of submodular selection is to greedily select samples that maximize some notion of diversity so that the subset eliminates redundancy and allows for machine learning models to be trained to high accuracy with a small fraction of the total data set. This topic is particularly interesting to me as a grad student because data sets are getting larger and machine learning models are getting more computationally intensive, but it can be difficult to get hardware to keep up with large companies.

Rather than use the dusty research code that our lab had, I decided to write a quick and general purpose Python package for diverse subset selection, apricot, which can be found here: https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot

apricot implements two types of functions; feature based ones, which scale to millions of samples, and facility location ones, which are more general purpose but slower. These functions are agnostic to the model you end up training, so they can just as easily be used to reduce the size of an unlabeled data set for clustering as they can to reduce the size of a labeled data set you'll train a neural network on. It uses numba to accelerate the computational intensive aspects, and facility location functions support sparse matrices with corresponding speed gains. apricot uses the scikit-learn API and so can be dropped into current pipelines with minimal changes to your code for faster training of your models. 

apricot was built to be easy to use, just

    from apricot import FacilityLocationSelection
    X_subset = FacilityLocationSelection(100).fit_transform(X)

A tutorial on what submodular selection is and how to use apricot to do it can be found here: https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot/blob/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Submodular%20Selection.ipynb

A work-in-progress tutorial on how submodular selection works and how the code can be optimized can be found here: https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot/blob/master/2.%20How%20Do%20Submodular%20Functions%20Work%3F.ipynb

For instance:

*Your $700 Nvidia 1080 Ti performs at 90% speed compared to the cloud Nvidia V100 GPU (which uses next gen Volta tech). This is because Cloud GPUs suffer from slow IO between the instance and the GPU, so even though the V100 may be 1.52x faster in theory, IO slows it down in practice. Since youre using a M.2 SSD, IO is blazing fast on your own computer.*

*The machine I built costs $3k and has the parts shown below. Theres one 1080 Ti GPU to start (you can just as easily use the new 2080 Ti for Machine Learning at $500 morejust be careful to get one with a blower fan design), a 12 Core CPU, 64GB RAM, and 1TB M.2 SSD. You can add three more GPUs easily for a total of four.*

The author claims that the breakeven cost is ~ 2 months for single GPU vs AWS, and 2 weeks for the 4 GPU version, though one has to be careful with choosing components that will support well the 4 GPU version (he will discuss the nuances in a later post).

Annotated implementations with comparative introductions for minimax, non-saturating, Wasserstein, Wasserstein gradient penalty, least squares, deep regret analytic, bounded equilibrium, relativistic, f-divergence, Fisher, and information generative adversarial networks (GANs), and standard, variational, and bounded information rate variational autoencoders (VAEs).

&amp;#x200B;

One of the primary purposes of this repository is to make implementing deep generative model (i.e., GAN/VAE) variants as easy as possible. This is possible because, typically but not always (e.g. BIRVAE), the proposed modifications only apply to the way loss is computed for backpropagation. Thus, the core training class is structured in such a way that most new implementations should only require edits to the train\_D and train\_G functions of GAN Trainer classes, and the compute\_batch function of VAE Trainer classes. Suppose we have a non-saturating GAN and we wanted to implement a least-squares GAN. To do this, all we have to do is change two lines.

I am currently doing simple linear/polynomial regression with Scikit Learn for my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking into improving my regression model by making some weights vary by groups, and I found packages Pystan and Pymc3, which use MCMC. However this seems like overkill (hard to code, computationally intensive) and I am wondering if it's possible just to adapt the loss function used for least squares regression, so that one of the weights is switched according to the group of the training instance.

In case you are interested in the exact problem I am solving, I am predicting the unloading time of a vehicle at a retail store. I have various input parameters including hour of day. I can group my stores into groups according to city centre, out of town, or rural locations, and I have noticed that the hourly pattern of the unloading time varies greatly among these groups. Therefore I would like my ""hour"" independent variable to have a weight that varies by group, while my other independent variables should be handled the same across groups. I'd be grateful for any advice on how best to handle this problem.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Regarding text recognition topic I found this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05404.pdf and it seems to have least data preparation from what I see, since I dont need bounding boxes for my input data. Tho, I struggle to find good labeling tool that could help me extract with high accuracy a text from training data (it is needed for input). 

My questions are:

1. Do you know any good libraries/software that could help me? As for now the best tool I found is Tesseract, but it is very hard to tune (forgive me, I am beginner in DL field, hence those questions :) ). Any ideas how to tackle this problem?

2. Are there maybe better ways to tackle this particular problem?

3. Is Chainer worth learning if I would like to analyze code from mentioned paper? Im planning to use PyTorch(and maybe fast.ai) in my project, so learning another library would be pretty costly time-wise.

paper abstract:

We seek to automate the design of molecules based on specific chemical properties. In computational terms, this task involves continuous embedding and generation of molecular graphs. Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",2,15,False,self,,,,,

Gan can be considered as predicting a probability distribution over a complex space of data elements. Generator samples from this complex distribution and the true distribution and gives it to the discriminator.

The gradient is then back-propagated through these samples them.

Is GAN way of evaluating the gradient same as the reparametrization trick of VAE, where sampling is done from the noise which doesn't depend on the generator parameter and the generator n/w acts as a deterministic function ?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is the place I should post this, if not I am sorry.

Not long ago I started as a junior Data Scientist in a research company, working a little bit in every aspect of DS (data analytics the less).   
I have a BS in Computer Science, and my skills in creating pipelines and programing are *really good*, but the problem is that my skills in machine learning are **not** good enough.

In the degree, I only studied basic statistics and two machine learning algorithms (Linear regression and Decision trees), and even though I know the basics of machine learning, I need to know a lot more to do a better job.

&amp;#x200B;

My objective is to become an expert in classification algorithms, just because the projects we work on need this sort of solutions most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is:**

Is there any online course or book **specific** for classification algorithms? I am **not searching for general books**, I already know some, I search for any kind of resource to make me an expert in classification algorithms.

For example could a proper text generator have sub targets that perform on semantics, irony detection etc. Those could then be weighted for the main goal of generating a certain kind of text, where for example for comedic output, irony could get stronger weighting etc.

I'm new to the world machine learning and I started with deep learning using it mostly as a black box tool. With the time, I'm trying to understand how everything works, and I'm now focusing on the categorical crossentropy loss. 

I always used it for classification problems and I never really questioned its definition. However, now that I'm looking at it, I noticed that it only takes into account the probability of the label for the sample that I'm training on. For example if the true label is [0, 1, 0] and the predicted label is [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], the categorical crossentropy will only look at 0.8.

Would it not make more sense if I also tried to minimise the probability of the other classes, besides maximising the probability of the target class? An example could be having a loss which combines the categorical crossentropy of the class, and the same thing for 1-prob of negative classes. Do people use such a loss? Is there any disadvantage is using it?

Thank you",7,5,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to share this work that was done in collaboration between a data scientist and a radiologist : [https://medium.com/owkin/a-machine-learning-survival-kit-for-doctors-97982d69a375](https://medium.com/owkin/a-machine-learning-survival-kit-for-doctors-97982d69a375). We try to explain to medical researchers what AI means in practice along with an in depth case study on brain aging. It may also be an interesting introduction to MRI data for the ML community.

&amp;#x200B;

We explain the fundamentals of ML  (cross validation, overfitting), the most popular models (linear models, gradient tree boosting, convolutional neural networks), and the limitations in healthcare (validation must be done properly, lack of data standards, need of interpretable algorithms, problem of transferability / domain adapation *etc.*).

I was reading [this thing about shitty researchers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9gg4gf/r_researchers_that_claim_they_will_release_code/) and something came to my mind. 

Let's say a researcher, Josh, writes one of these papers that do not contain code and the used dataset and any other tools required to consistently reproduce the research and this paper gets published.

Then James sees this paper, gives it a brief read maybe, and decides to do some research into the topic as well. Assuming he manages to get similar results trough the same procedure (obviously the code will not be the exact same but the math behind it let's suppose is quite similar) could he realistically publish (and have it recognized obviously) a paper containing that research and claiming it as 100% his?

Let us assume that we have the following: x\[n\] - x\[n-d\] = y\[n\], where d is some delay. Furthermore, you know all x's, and all y's in your ""labelled"" data-set.

The solution that finally gave 100% accuracy on the test set required a bit of data augmentation and feature engineering. What I did was:

1. Add distances between cards as features. E.g. distance between Jack and King is 2, between King and Three is 3 and so on.

2. Increase training dataset 4 times.

And the neural network implementation in keras looks like this:

    model = keras.Sequential()
    
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(120, activation='relu', input_shape=(30,)))
    model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.2))

1. saying we have existing 1000 records indicate which kind of machines will be purchased by which regions of the customers
2. with those 1000 records we trained a model (input:customer regions, output: machine categories)
3. then we apply this model to predict the the machine categories for the new customers
4. our sales consultant will recommend the suggested machine to the customer
5. The customers will purchase the machine following or not following the recommendation from the sales consultant

The question is can we improve the model with the output from step 5? 

It looks to me that the data output from step 5 is impacted by the behavior of sales consultant while the sales consultant is guided by the output of the model itself. So I think it will overfit the model? If it is an over-fit what is the right way in this situation?

1. If a word exists in Google's corpus, it is assigned a 300-dimension array to represent that word
2. I apply this to every word in a given text, giving me an array of dimensions \[n, 300\], where n represents the number of total words

I honestly think that the research direction the original [differentiable plasticity paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464) opened is more revolutionary than it seems at first glance.

Not only does it have great tie ins to biologically plausible learning, it is the first time I saw a RNN being used to update another network's weights. Because now a successful example of that exists, a vast range of research into biologically plausible learning rules and not just Hebbian learning is suddenly live and could potentially be used to great effect as a part of deep learning.

Right now, all metalearning approaches have significant flaws:

1) MAML - In addition to being expensive, it has the large disadvantage of introducing the artificial metatraining/training separation.

2) SNAIL - It is a particularly large architecture.

3) Plasticity - It requires copying the plastic weights at every timestep in order to backprop through it. This is a huge memory expenditure.

In case of plasticity it is actually possible to work around its disadvantages by reversing the weight updates. I've done a little numerical stability testing of how various update rules behave in reverse mode and have discovered that while the EMA and Oja's rules from the original paper are stable for 1k-10k steps after which the weights explode due to exponential accumulation of error, weight norm can be reversed for 100s of thousands of timesteps with only tiny error even when float32 types are used.

When [reversible computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQZ_bQbxSXk) finally arrives it will have significant implications for learning.

There was [a reversible learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492) from 2015 which used it to optimize hyperparameters that I now see in an entirely different light. It is really too bad this was not tried for networks in networks.

That having said simple local unsupervised learning rules like for Hebbian learning have their advantages in that they can be easily reversed and would not require higher order differentiation for that to be done.

The Backpropamine paper is actually quite surprising to me in its content - in my own testing on Binary Pattern I've tried modulating the weight updates directly as was done in the paper, but I've found it to be highly unstable and eventually removed it. That might have been because I was modulating the plasticity coefficients in tandem with that so it might be worth revisiting. At least on the Binary Pattern, I've found modulating the plasticity coefficients to work very well - the plastic RNN from the original paper takes over 1k iterations to get to 99% sign accuracy on the Binary Pattern test. The architecture that modulates the plasticity coefficients managed to get to that point in about 60.

But that is just one sample on a toy task - there is a lot of work to be done before this line of research comes to fruition and it should be interesting follow as plasticity enables capabilities that would otherwise be impossible in regular RNNs. I'd like to see this tried on Dota and Starcraft. A recent [R2D2 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lyTjAqYX) came out showing great gains in using a LSTM for learning value-action functions and better memories in a RNN will only extend that advantage.",33,203,False,self,,,,,

Ultimately loading and processing a dataset like the IMDB movie review one can be as simple as the following code:

\`\`\`python

from keras.layers import \*

from keras.models import \*

from torchtext import data, datasets

&amp;#x200B;

from kltt import WrapIterator

&amp;#x200B;

text\_field = data.Field(fix\_length=100)

label\_field = data.Field(sequential=False, unk\_token=None)

&amp;#x200B;

train\_set, test\_set = datasets.IMDB.splits(text\_field, label\_field)

train\_it, test\_it = data.BucketIterator.splits(\[train\_set, test\_set\], \[32\] \* 2, repeat=True)

&amp;#x200B;

text\_field.build\_vocab(train\_set, max\_size=10000)

label\_field.build\_vocab(train\_set)

&amp;#x200B;

train\_data, test\_data = WrapIterator.wraps(\[train\_it, test\_it\], \['text'\], \['label'\], permute={'text': (1, 0)})

&amp;#x200B;

model = Sequential()

model.add(Embedding(10000, 300))

model.add(LSTM(128))

model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

&amp;#x200B;

model.compile('adam', 'binary\_crossentropy', metrics=\['accuracy'\])

model.fit\_generator(iter(train\_data), steps\_per\_epoch=len(train\_data), epochs=3)

loss, acc = model.fit\_generator(iter(test\_data), epochs=len(test\_data))

\`\`\`

I'm new to this subreddit and kinda new to machine learning, but I read some good articles and know some stuffs, like applying the natural selection so the fittest individuals can reproduce and reinforce ""good behaviors"" from the individuals while punishing them from bad behaviours.

--

--

I'm currently working on a little project, where my individuals can do 3 actions: wander, run and rest. Moving consumes stamina, and resting restores them.

The individuals have an ""intelligence"" level, that decrees if it rest with nearly full stamina or moves with low stamina.

Only the individuals with the highest fitness (distance moved + intelligence) can reproduce.

--

--

My question is: following this approach, I'm I ""getting in the way"" of the machine learning? I'm I crossing the line described in the title?

I mean, it feels right that only the most intelligent organism reproduces, and the next generations try to mimic them (while trying to be better).

But, the punishing part, doesn't feel so right. Is it ok to do that in machine learning?

Would you do different? How?

I've been building this thing for the past few months and I want some people to try it out and give me some feedback! I'm hoping we can build a useful dataset of translations, and then we can start making new DataSources to power new datasets (labeled images, named entity recog., etc.).

[Metro](https://metro.exchange)

Metro allows data science projects to be powered by a crowd of people who self-generate the data for it. One of its primary uses is to create open datasets collaboratively, where every contributor is able to access all of the data.

# How it works

Data generation happens on your computer, using ""DataSources"". A DataSource is a community-made, open-source plugin for Metro, which generates data for you. 

You simply install the Metro browser extension and activate the DataSources which power the project. You'll also need to signup, which doesn't require email verification right now so it takes about 10 seconds.

# Sentence Translation Project

As a test-run, I made an Open Data project for gathering sentence-level translations in 7 languages, and I would like everyone to try it out! 

[**[Open Data] Sentence Translations**](https://metro.exchange/projects/od-sentence-translations/)

It's powered by a [DataSource](https://metro.exchange/datasources/text-translation/) which allows you to highlight any text on the internet, right-click, press a ""translate"" button, and enter your translation.

You'll need to 1. [sign up](https://metro.exchange/signup), 2. install the extension, and 3. activate the DataSource on the [project](https://metro.exchange/projects/od-sentence-translations/) page

# Future

I want Metro to be able to support open-data generation of any scale. Eventually, I want it to be the backbone for startups powered by ethical, self-generated data because it provides access to data from any platform on the internet - including ""closed"" ones like Facebook, Google, etc., while giving users true autonomy over their data.

Any feedback, help, or just usage of the system is really useful for trying to improve the problems that I just can't see yet. I'm just a guy recently graduated from college so don't judge me too harshly for any problems.
