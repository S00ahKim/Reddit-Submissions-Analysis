Ayudame!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9ljrd/dear_mleddit_i_have_a_few_questions_about/,authorblues,1253206807,"So we are studying Artificial Neural Networks as one of our first steps in my machine learning course, and I have some questions for which I don't think I want to go to my professor:

**Background:** I am developing the same old alpha-beta search-tree pruning chess playing program that everyone else in the world has. I plan to, at some point, set it up to run on a Beowulf cluster or some other sort of distributed network in order to push it faster. I would like, however to set up its ""base case"" (evaluation of a single position in a chess game as the leaf of the tree) to be evaluated through a neural network, one that I have trained with the large amount of expert data (LARGE amount) I have collected. Evaluation will be the process of assigning a ""score"" to a position, with a maximum score of K, where a score of +K is the best possible score in favor of white, and -K is the best possible score in favor of black.

**Expert Data:** A bit more information about my expert data: chess games are often stored in a notation called PGN, the most important details given in this expert data is A) who won the game (which I think I can use to decide whose moves to categorize positively and whose moves to categorize negatively), and B) every move made, which I already have a system capable of parsing these moves.

1) I know that the basis of training a neural network (and really the basis of any machine learning training phase) is attempting to achieve results as close to a target function as possible. In this case, I don't have a ""known"" target function. I just want to be as ""correct"" as possible. In cases like this, where the target function isn't known up-front, but can really only be assessed later (as in, this player won, so his moves should possibly be scored higher), how is the best way to achieve this goal?

2) For a chessboard representation, there are many pieces of information that can be gathered: what piece is on a square, how many of one piece are on a board, where is a particular piece located (sort of the reverse of ""what piece is on a square""), what is the ""positional value"" (some pieces are more suited at particular locations on the board) or ""material value"" (some pieces are worth more than others) of a board, things of this nature. What should the input to a neural network given the abundance of data available regarding each position? is it feasible to expect the input nodes to be 64 nodes representing each position on the board, and this be enough for the network to be able to learn the subtle nuances between pieces and positions and strength?

In regards to (2), Im not asking what my input set should be. I dont want you guys to do my work for me. I just dont know whether or not ONLY providing the 64 squares of the board as input data is a realistic input set to expect the results Im wanting.

3) Is it problematic -- or really, does it even matter -- that the input set is likely to be discrete, while Im wanting continuous output? I dont think I quite grasp whether or not this is an issue with neural networks.

4) Is it possible to give a neural network negative training data? Im not sure if it would help or hurt, but with this wealth of expert data I have, I could potentially use the loser as negative training data. If I cant, I honestly have more than enough positive data that this shouldnt be a problem.",17,15,False,self,,,,,
