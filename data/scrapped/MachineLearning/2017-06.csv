I've heard some stories, but it's hard to get a good idea of how the startup environment within machine learning really works. I would love to hear more (and hopefully others would too) about your experiences with doing a machine learning startup. In particular, I'd like to hear more about the following questions, but please feel free to add anything you think is relevant!

1. How long time did it take from the idea being conceived to the startup being founded and then to a potential acquisition (in case of aiming for an exit) or positive bottom line (in case of aiming for building a long-term company)?
2. What were the main obstacles holding you back from realizing your machine learning startup?
3. How do you balance research and building a startup? For instance, there seems to be a compromise between withholding information that competitors could use and publishing research before other academics invent something similar. This seems particularly relevant for anyone trying to balance both academia and a startup more or less at the same time.

2. [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statml/)
3. [High Dimensional Probability](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html#) [free book]

I'm not a mathematician but a computer scientist so I took several courses about discrete math (combinatorics, generating functions, etc...), but only two about Analysis (*not* calculus).

My understanding is that to gain a proper understanding of probability and statistical learning theory I need to study Measure Theory and Functional Analysis.

Should I study both topic well ([Kolmogorov&amp;Fomin](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Analysis-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486612260) or [Serge Lang](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Analysis-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387940014/)) or just focus on Functional Analysis without Measure Theory ([Kreyszig](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Functional-Analysis-Applications-Kreyszig/dp/0471504599/))?

While many practitioners claim that math is not so important in ML, many ML researchers know quite a lot of math. One researcher told me that he learned a lot of math early in his career but that, ultimately, he didn't use any of that stuff in his research. But how can he be so sure? Maybe his mathematical studies formed his way of thinking and he's using mathematical ideas without even realizing it.

I realize this is outside of the usual scope of /r/machinelearning but I still think it's appropriate to post here. It's a ""help"" question in a sense, but it's not a simple one. So I believe it abides by subreddit policy.

 I've had this problem on a recommender system for a while ([here is a Stack Exchange post I made on it] (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/283414/using-the-em-algorithm-on-a-latent-factor-model-collaborative-filtering)) and haven't managed to get a good answer.

Specifically, my question stems from a desire to use EM on a latent factor modeling (i.e. a collaborative filtering algorithm) to infer missing genre information in the model. I do know the math behind EM (but not perfectly), and I have an intuition of how to use it in practice. Based on that intuition, I think in the E-step, I want to compute the likelihood that a movie without genre information falls into each of my 20 genres. And in the M-step, I want to optimize my model based on the best imputation of the missing values.

But now I realize that I have fundamental questions on how to apply EM that underly the confusion in my Stack Exchange post:

In a normal EM definition, you have your model parameters ****, your data **X**, and your missing/latent variables **Z**. I believe in my model, **** refers to the parameters of my latent factor model (, , , , ); **X** refers to the user/item ratings pairs; and **Z** refers to the genre information () that is missing for some movies -- for starters, is that the correct formulation?

And more importantly, I'm not sure how to construct the proper likelihood function, based on my latent factor model: **L(, X, Z) = P(X,Z|)**. I'm not even sure how to begin here. Any amount of guidance would be much appreciated.

**tl;dr** (for more information look at the repo linked below): I trained a convolutional network (U-net architecture) with 13 million parameters to segment a circle on a noisy image and training it on only one sample was enough to make the network able to segment circles of other sizes and location.

Just to be clear, I don't claim to have found anything novel, I'm just curious how people with more expertise would interpret this result since I for myself just expected the network to memorize the one training sample and as a result do bad on unseen samples. (Edit: ""My network"" was not worded well, I did not invent the architecture, it's (a modified version of?) the U-net architecture).

I understand how the CNN is going to work on my data, but I need advice on how to set it up in Keras.

In my dataset, each datapoint is structured as follows. There are *n* columns, each of which is sensor data of people performing an action. There are 10 rows where each row is a single person's sensor data for that event. The label column is a score for how well they performed. Since each of their performances is related, each datapoint is a 10 by *n* matrix, and the label column for each data point is a 10 by 1 vector of scores.

Essentially, I want to set up my NN so that it treats:

Person | Sensor0 | Sensor1 | Sensor2 | Win
---|---|----|----|----
A | data | data | data | 0
B | data | data | data | 0
C | data | data | data | 0
D | data | data | data | 0

F | data | data | data | 0
G | data | data | data | 0
H | data | data | data | 1

A | data | data | data | 0
F | data | data | data | 0

In my first layer (at the least), I want to set up convolutional neurons (I'm starting with 5, and moving on from there) so that each row shares weights amongst the observations, in such a way that the order I put the row in the datapoint doesn't matter (aside from it's correspondence with the label).

I've been learning about tensorflow from this tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/. It looks like this problem could be approached in a similar way to the way the MNIST problem was solved in the tutorials.

- Build a dataset of 5 second audio clips, marked as either 'entirely ad', or 'partial ad/no ad' 
- convert each clip into a large rank 1 vector (x), with each coordinate being a value of a sample
- the model has a rank two variable vector (W) containing the weights for not an ad / is an add, and another rank two variable vector (b) with the biases 
- so the model is as in the tutorial: y = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(x, W) + b)
- could use same loss function / optimizer as in the tutorial as well

What do you think? Would that work? How would you go about it?

I am trying to implement max-margin loss function for negative sampling. I haven't come across a clean implementation of such a loss in Keras. The way I interpret it is that we need to create batches of positive and negative/corrupt samples. Say, the batch size if 100, so it should have 50 positive and 50 negative samples. The loss function receives these individual batches and is implemented as

    def max_margin(y_true, y_pred):
        mid = y_pred.shape[0]/2
        y_pos = y_pred[:mid]
        y_neg = y_pred[mid:]
        return K.mean(K.maximum(0., 1. - y_pos + y_neg))
*Here, y_pred is the cost computed by the model and y_true are the actual lables.*

This implementation does not produce any meaningful results. Is there something that I am missing? 

There can be another solution to achieve max-margin like objective. We can create positive and negative samples and assign them labels as +1 and -1 and use **mean square error(MSE)** loss function instead, simply for classification. I feel that MSE would try to bring the score of positive samples close to +1 and negative samples would have a score that is near -1. Is this not analogous to contrastive max-margin?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

so I'm pretty new to ML and TensorFlow in General but for my master thesis I'm trying to improve a scheduling algorithm I programmed. I went for tensorflow and installed jupyter for a start and implemented my first models for handwriting recognition. Basic stuff. 

The actual problem is that I have a 15 element input tensor (describing the scheduling scenario) and I want to generate a 4 element output tensor that gives me some parameters for my algorithm. I randomly generated a data set (labled as far as I understand) that contains input and output elements and connects them with a score which should be as low (good) as possible. 

So if I want to generate a model that gives me as good as possible output so that the algorithm can compute a schedule with the score as good as possible, how can I model a NN that in can be trained by this data later gives me good ouput for any scenario.

TL;DR:

I need a NN with 
Input = 15 element Tensor
Ouput = 4 element Tensor

Output will be used for Java scheduling algorithm. Schedule has Score (computed and normalized from missed deadlines, makespan and so on)

Training data has 3 tables (Input, Output, Score) and is generated randomly over the weekend.

I have no idea if this is clear enough, but any help is apreciated!

Thanks in advance and a good day

It allows you to add differentiable CRF inference as a layer to any fully-convolutional model that produces classification output whose resolution matches the input. It's particularly useful for semantic segmentation models, but can be used for any dense prediction task.

It's still somewhat of a WIP but it does work. I was able to successfully train a network with the CRF layer as a component.

Code can be found here: https://github.com/hapemask/crfrnn_layer

It includes a differentiable Theano op for high-dimensional Gaussian filtering on the GPU w/a permutohedral lattice as well. Hopefully someone will find it useful, let me know if it doesn't work on your machine. It runs about 2x slower in python2 vs python3 but I don't use python2 so I haven't been motivated to fix that yet.

This is my first attempt at writing a new layer for Lasagne or a new op for Theano, so if you have any experience with those and see something weird, please let me know!",6,8,False,self,,,,,

Glass is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that allows your smartphone to understand what is in a photo. For instance, point your phone at an object and Glass will tell you what it is!

This advanced Augmented Reality tool can recognise whatever youre looking at and offer any essential information you require.
Impressive object recognition and real-time information

Glass goes a clear step by recognising a much greater range of objects, including natural stuff. Extra information such as breeds of dogs, flower species, etc would be implemented as the application grows.

Currently, Glass is available as a public BETA and can be downloaded from play store directly (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achandratre.glass).

Screenshots : http://imgur.com/a/h1AvL

Please note that the results may not be 100% accurate as the application is in its initial stages of development.

I'd appreciate if you share the word and provide a feedback on the Play Store Listing.

Certain items will be surfaced because of factor A, another because of factor B, and yet another because of factor C. We can create individual heuristics for each factor, but we then need to combine these heuristics in such a way that it promotes the best content considering each factor while still giving a mix of content from each factor.

Our naive approach is to load the top n from each factor, take the first of each, and make those the first 3 of the feed. Then take the 2nd from each feed and make that the second 3, and so on and so forth. Ideally, we would have some algorithm for more intelligently ranking these feed items - our first thought was to simply sum the three heuristics and pull the top items using the resulting combined score, but there are no guarantees that the heuristics are evenly-scaled (or are evenly-scaled for that particular user), which could result in one factor dominating over the others in the feed. Is there some more intelligent way of ranking these news feed items (akin to what Facebook does in its pseudo-chronological news feed)?

Especially with the tooling now available.

To get my feet wet a bit, I made a pretty simple NN model to do some non-linear regressions for me. I uploaded my jupyter notebookit as a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/thearn/be9f98c5c2a6f87068490808f374a07c) (renders properly on github), which is pretty short and to the point.

It just fits the 1D function y = (x - 5)^2 / 25. 

I know that Theano and Tensorflow are, at their core, graph based derivative (gradient) passing frameworks. And utilizing the gradients of loss functions with respect to weights for gradient step-based optimization are the main purpose of that. 

But what I'm trying to get sense of is if I have access to something that, given a trained model, can approximate derivatives of inputs with respect to the output layer for me (not the weights or loss function). So for this case, I would want y' = 2(x-5)/25.0 estimated via the network's derivative graph for me for an indicated value of the input x, in the network's currently trained state.

Do I have any options in either the Keras or Theano/TF backend APIs to do this, or do I need to do my own chain ruling somehow with the weights (or maybe adding my own non-trainable ""identity"" layers or something)? In my notebook, you can see me trying a few approaches based what I was able to find so far, but without a ton of success.",6,4,False,self,,,,,

Abstract: Automating statistical modelling is a challenging problem that has far-reaching implications for artificial intelligence. The Automatic Statistician employs a kernel search algorithm to provide a first step in this direction for regression problems. However this does not scale due to its O(N^3) running time for the model selection. This is undesirable not only because the average size of data sets is growing fast, but also because there is potentially more information in bigger data, implying a greater need for more expressive models that can discover finer structure. We propose Scalable Kernel Composition (SKC), a scalable kernel search algorithm, to encompass big data within the boundaries of automated statistical modelling.",2,14,False,self,,,,,

Sparsity and compressive sensing has seen a lot of applications in both machine learning and image processing, and it seems easy enough to use sparsity inducing algorithms in deep learning (especially for image and audio processing). Does anyone know why this is not done? 

In addition to this, almost all papers that mentions TV or L1 regularization use (sub)gradient descent based methods, not forward-backward splitting algorithms even though these have proven better convergence rates. 

I understand why you wouldn't use L1 for the kernels, but why do I not see any work on e.g. structured sparsity? Also, for visualization, why isn't e.g. total variation regularisation used more? 

The reason I'm asking is that I am thinking of implementing the FISTA algorithm and play around with sparsity-inducing regularisation and I would like to know if this is a complete waste of my time.

I have been trying to train a CNN with a somewhat small set (~1000) of train/test images (out of millions of images). Through a ton of trial and error I found that although data augmentation (10s of thousands of images) and regularization help a bit, I cannot overcome the overfitting issue on deep CNNs (eg Alexnet, Vgg). Not surprising, but I wanted to try it out. I'm a one man show and it is a very obscure dataset specific to a particular field. So increasing this to hundreds of thousands of images seems improbable.

Weirdly enough, I found that a shallow CNN (one convolutional layer and 3 fully connected layers) with a lot of dropout produces decent results (~levels out around 92% accuracy 85% recall validation set). However, this is not close to what I get with hand crafted features and xgboost or random forest (95% accuracy 93% recall on test set). Just for fun, I decided to pass the training images through the best CNN and use its class probabilities as a feature input into the GBT/RF. This increased their performance on the test set (98% accuracy 96% recall).

My question is.. am I stacking the deck here? Does this 3% increase on the test set mean anything? I almost see this as a small visual vs nonvisual ensemble. It seems as though these additional features increases accuracy by fixing some misclassifications for a couple of labels, whereas the other classes remain fairly unchanged in accuracy. 

If this is a poor approach, is there a better way? Perhaps using flattened output from the convolutional layer?",9,13,False,self,,,,,

If it relates to what you're researching, by all means elaborate and give us your insight, otherwise it could just be an interesting paper you've read.

Please try to provide some insight from your understanding and please don't post things which are present in wiki.

Preferably you should link the arxiv page (not the PDF, you can easily access the PDF from the summary page but not the other way around) or any other pertinent links.

&gt; I feel like part of the problem is that in a lot of ways what we're doing here simply is not science. It's engineering. And in engineering, you want people to be sharing ideas and interesting results as quickly and seamlessly as you can. Some won't go anywhere, and some won't rise to the level of journal publication, but that doesn't mean people won't benefit / get ideas from them.
It's not like you need to be a peer-reviewer to reproduce their results, in most cases. That's what's neat about the field: if you can rent an EC2 instance and write python, you can check many of the results for yourself.

The field is about building things to solve problems, the progress is defined by how well you solve these problems (some performance metric). I think once you view it from this perspective, you start seeing what the community values amidst all the hype and debate.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

I've had some strange results. Most of the time, on each epoch the model will sample a single face many times. It looks good, but there is zero diversity, which seems possible, but it's strange that it changes epoch to epoch. Anyway, when I turn lambda way way up, I get good diversity, and the samples look fantastic, but they just never seem to learn hair. I don't mean that in the sense of normal BEGAN or VAE samples with blurry hair. I mean most people are bald or have only a little bit of hair on top. It feels like it's still a problem with forcing diversity, but I've maxed out the lambda parameter and I'm not sure what else to do. Any ideas?

For example, consider the language modeling task where you are using a soft attention over all the previous words to predict the next word. Since the number of previous words change over time, we need to learn an attention model that can compute similarity and softmax scores over a varying sized set of hidden states. Just a hypothetical example.

The problem I am tackling is not language modeling but instead something like multi-sequence prediction, where the number of sequences vary over time and the sequences are dependent on each other.
So, in order to predict the next element in a specific sequence, I need to compute a soft attention over the hidden states of all the other sequences and use that as an input. But since the number of sequences vary, I need to learn a varying length attention model.

I think it is interesting to see how accurately it can learn attention (or softmax scores) with varying length.",5,7,False,self,,,,,

In most of my models, the validation error always fluctuates a lot and I end up running the training until a large number of epochs and take the epoch at which the validation loss was the least. This necessarily wasn't the best model to choose at test time, but it is hard to pick one. But the whole advantage of early stopping is that we get to stop training early and save on training time, which I am losing out on as I am not sure when to stop.

I'm currently scoping out a Master's thesis project in hardware acceleration of neural nets.

I've seen plenty of papers published in the last couple years that do just that for various types of networks, e.g. [ESE: Efficient Speech Recognition Engine with Sparse LSTM on FPGA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00694v2.pdf). 

I've been on Arxiv Sanity for the past couple months trying to find an application in need of hardware acceleration, and some of the most interesting papers, like [this one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01194v1.pdf), have used an LSTM on top of a CNN for learning temporal relations of spatial features.

A while back, the scheduled sampling [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099) was released. They showed how you could sample from the previous timestep t, feed that sample back into the embedding, and train the network on the next timestep t+1.

This limits exposure bias because you are training the network parts of its own generated sequence. They show that its best to do this in a curriculum learning fashion. 

The problem with this approach is that the sampling step is non-differentiable, and so the network has no way of knowing what caused it's input on timestep t+1. In reality, it was network's action on the previous timestep that caused this input.

To circumvent this problem, I wanted to run this proposal by you guys. Instead of sampling from the softmax distribution, you take the entire softmax distribution and multiply it by the embedding and apply reduce_sum:

    next_input_vector = reduce_sum(softmax_distribution * embedding)

In this way, the next input_vector is fully differentiable and weights the word embedding that the softmax distribution favors. You would still apply this in curriculum learning approach. Has anyone tried this/what are your thoughts?

Suppose an episode and its event sequence (x1, . . . , xT) satisfy a computable criterion used to decide whether a given problem has been solved (e.g., total error E below some threshold). Then the set of used weights is called a solution to the problem, and the depth of the deepest CAP within the sequence is called the solution depth. There may be other solutions (yielding different event sequences) with different depths. Given some fixed NN topology, the smallest depth of any solution is called the problem depth. 
I tried to Google but I failed. This becomes crucial in the next page, where he argues that:

the problems of depth &gt; 10 will require very Deep Learning.

What does he mean by solution depth?

So just for fun I was wondering if it is possible to create a program that can automatically categorize any reddit submission (without looking at the sub-reddit) to appropriate sub-reddit.

One way I think to do it would be to download 50K submissions from 10 popular subreddits, then split each title using the nltk.tokenize and ntlk.stem and train my model. The labels would the sub-reddit to which the submission belongs.

I'll be using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeamFbHhmDo&amp;list=PLSPWNkAMSvv5DKeSVDbEbUKSsK4Z-GgiP&amp;index=8) as my guide to do it.

Please let me know if what you think about this project. Is my approach any good or is there a better way to do it?

I recently just got into Machine Learning and decided to make my own Neural Net class (and also convolution neural net class, but that isn't quite done yet) in Java just to experiment with ML and see what I could do.  For me, it was a fun opportunity to learn more about Neural nets and try to figure out how they work.  As I was reading ML articles, it always felt like they glossed over how to do batch processing and it felt like even fewer articles described how to calculate the gradient in a batch learning model in a way that was understandable for someone who hasn't studied this area before.  Since it seemed like there weren't a ton of concrete examples from my searches, I thought maybe I'd post this here in case anyone else was curious.  I know I still have stuff to do on my project, but I'd appreciate any thoughts / constructive criticism on what could be done better / or ideas on what to do next!

I would like to get an understanding of how to classify people's reaction to a tweet.

The idea is to follow tweets from organisations on Twitter. This way the initial tweets are at least coherent. They tweet something and I want to know: are people reacting positively, negatively or indifferent to it/spam/asking questions/etc? To do that I am thinking of doing sentiment analysis of the replies to that tweet.

So for example we have this initial [tweet](https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/875337970953224197). We can gather it is something about a new look from that (what part of Natural Language Processing is this called? PoS? NER? Can [SyntaxNet](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/an-upgrade-to-syntaxnet-new-models-and.html) be used?). Then I want to get an overall feel for the tweet. Are people reacting positively, negatively or indifferent/neutral/asking questions? How would one go about that and what are recommended papers to read regarding this?

Would it cost much to use Mechanical Turk to do the labelling? I could imagine it would be a requirement to have a lot of labelled tweets for it to work.

Also: could the same techniques easily be applied to Reddit submissions and comments you think?",8,21,False,self,,,,,

I don't want to spend soo much time trying to put together implementations of all these papers when I'll undoubtedly have to spend a lot of time fine-tuning hyperparameters for the one approach I'll end up fielding. I have half a mind to just choose the simplest to implement and hope for the best, but if I try to publish my results (application of Deep RL algorithm to a real-world robot) will it look naive to have implemented a DQN variant as opposed to the latest DeepRL algorithm?

After retraining inception v3 on this data set, which contains 200+ images per class, I get a ~96% test accuracy. The issue I'm running into is that *any new image that I ask it to recognize, which should score very low for both categories, is confidently scored as one of the image categories.*

For example, if I train it on the two types of steering wheels that are exactly the same except one category/type has two buttons on the right. After training has finished, if I show inception an image of some other random thing, like a horse, it confidently scores it as one of the steering wheel categories!

The current issue is that there is no way to get insight as to why this is happening. How can you visually tell that the model has correctly learned that the *real* difference between the two steering wheel categories is presence or absence of the the two buttons on the right?

But how can I extend off of this to factor in player/opponent relationships? Since these kind of relationships are a function of many past games, quantifying this relationship will start with a matrix of sorts, and it is not immediately obvious to me how best to capture the information in the matrix and use it as a feature with my existing trainig data (each row is a vector of floats)

My initial thoughts are to experiment with existing statistics for how a team does against players like a given player, or have some aggregation of past performance for the player, and an aggregation for the team. For example Batting average vs given team for given player. I feel like this has potential but would be very limited by my ability to make good assumptions.

One last potential approach I have thought of is to use an ensemble learning approach with a general model, a model for the specific player, and a model for the opposing team (and potentially other models). The training data for the ensemble model would be the output from the general model, and the outputs for the player + team specific models.

Is this ensemble approach at all viable? are any of the other approaches I've mentioned worth looking into? What other approaches are there to encapsulating this sort of additional but complex information into a model?

This can often increase the accuracy of the y(x) prediction.

This has some application when making meta models for compuationally expensive simulations for instance(given that the simulation is of such a nature that it provides the derivative for free, which is true for some CFD simulations for instance).

In the Gaussian Process Regression framework one is able to make use of this type of information beautifully(See section 9.4 in [Rassmussen &amp; Williams](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW9.pdf) for an instructive figure of what I am talking about).

I would like to look into ways of making use of this type of information for neural networks as well. Does  anyone have any info or ideas on this?

I have made a prototype that seems to work to some extent for a simple 1D example.

Here is the [gist](https://gist.github.com/maka89/bea8cb58205c9c2a17d9caf03b01cdb4).

Here is the ""secret sauce"" of the code:


tmp=neuralnet(x)

tmp2=tf.gradients(tmp,x)[0]

prediction=tf.concat([tmp,tmp2],1)


So my idea is to make a NN that predicts y(x). Then concatenate an extra output that is the derivative of the neural network with respect to x. Then train the network.

Sorry for the long post. Would like some input and other ideas on this if anyone else is interested in this ""small-data"" problem :)
And don't hesitate to ask if this was confusing.",7,11,False,self,,,,,

I come from a biostatistics/bioengineering background, so I am very familiar with machine learning and programming in several languages including c++ and Python. I've decided to pursue a master's degree in data science to compliment the research I've recently found myself interested in. I have room for around 3-4 elective classes in my schedule and I'm a little torn. One option is to take several applied math classes including optimization, Markov chains, and stochastic processes. I could also take several signal processing classes including digital signal processing, image processing etc. The last option is to take advanced database and algorithms classes. 

Do you think that applied math classes, signal processing classes, or database/algorithms classes are more important for machine learning? I do intend to continue working with medical datasets, so I could see myself dealing with image recognition in the future. 

Thank you everyone for the help and guidance. ",22,8,False,self,,,,,

This is my first time training on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet. I am using a **cross-entropy** loss function, with the **Adam** optimizer, batch-size of 8(GPU limitations), on a pre-trained **VGG-16** network, with a few additions, on the task of colorizing images(mapping L input to a*b*). For now, I am trying my model on train1.txt with the validation data from val1.txt. I haven't completed 1 epoch yet, but the loss gets close to 0(0.01 now) and the training accuracy gets stuck at 0.10. Is something wrong with this?

A few notes:

* The VGG-16 network is freezed, and used only for the semantic information
* I popped the unnecessary FC layers from VGG, as well as blocks 4 and 5
* The new layers are appended to the pre-trained model, with some residual-like connections. Does Keras take care of this? Do I have to initialize the weights here?

I am also normalizing the LAB channels like this(Python 3), and the last activation function is a Sigmoid

In brief: in dimensions greater than 1, the paper doesnt use the Cramer distance! In the GAN experiments of Section 5, it uses the energy distance. The model is therefore a generative moment matching network, using a particular kernel. Since the energy distance is an integral probability metric, the ""improved Wasserstein GAN"" training scheme proposed by Gulrajani et al. can be used to train input features to the kernel.

Overall, this is a good idea, and seems to give nice generator samples. Unfortunately, the Cramer GAN paper makes a problematic approximation, which means that the critic in this algorithm does not correctly compare the generator and reference (target) sample distributions: you can have a zero critic loss even with very different generator and reference distributions.",8,40,False,self,,,,,

I watched a talk about *RNNs* where the speaker claims that RNNs are not really *Turing Complete* (TC) because, according to him, the input is fed to the RNNs in a forced order and so the net can't control the tape. The speaker suggests that we would need Reinforcement Learning (to control the tape) to make RNNs Turing Complete.

This claim baffled me for several reasons. Mainly:

1. An RNN where we can ""control"" the order in which the input is presented to it is *NOT* an RNN.
2. Who says the tape must be external to the RNNs as the speaker seems to suggest?
3. If someone proved that RNNs are TC, then surely they managed to do it without *augmenting* RNNs in any way.

The speaker is pointing out the fact that expressibility != learnability, which is true for every sufficiently complex model, in practice. The problem is that his arguments are flawed.

I looked around and eventually stumbled on [a paper](http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1992_Siegelmann_COLT.pdf) which proves that RNNs are indeed Turing Complete.

I skimmed through the paper and I spotted the *trick* pretty quickly.

The first thing I thought while watching the talk is that an RNN could memorize the input some way and then maintain an *internal tape*, thus invalidating the claim of the speaker. This would make the RNN Turing Complete in theory, but not in practice since the input/output vectors are usually ""small"" and making them ""large"" would be quite problematic.

Indeed, the paper seems to use the same idea. We have *Finite State Automata* (FSA) which have a finite number of states and can only remember the state they're in. Then we have *Push Down (Finite State) Automata* (PDA) which also have an infinite stack and, finally, *Turing Machines* (TM) which have an infinite tape.

The problem with the stack is that it limits the order in which one can access memory and so PDA are less powerful than TMs. It turns out, however, that if we allow the automaton to have *two stacks*, then it's as powerful as a TM. Moreover, these stacks need only contain *binary digits*.

Therefore, we just need to prove that for each PDA there exists an RNN with can emulate that PDA. We don't need to worry about learning. We just need to prove that there are some weights which do the trick.

The trick used in the paper is to encode each stack as a *rational number*. These kinds of encodings are very common in proofs about cardinality. The authors decide to encode a 0 as 1 and a 1 as 3 to simplify the update operations. So, a stack with the elements s1, s2, s3, ..., sn can be encoded as

    q(s) = sum_{i=1}^n (2 si + 1)/(4^i)

For instance, if s = 01101, then q(s) = 0.13313, written in base 4. The push and pop operations are easy:

    push(q, v) = q/4 + (2v + 1)/4 = q/4 + v/2 + 1/4
    pop(q, v) = 4q - 2v - 1

Note that we need to know the element we're about to pop (v), but that's not a problem. Note that q is a rational number, so the RNN just need to have rational weights.

The input/output vectors will have 3 elements:

1. state
2. first stack
3. second stack

That's it. The paper dives into many other technical details but I think this is the gist of it. This is essentially my idea of maintaining an *internal tape*.

## Are RNNs *really* Turing Complete?

We claim that real computers are TC even though they have finite memory because we can imagine adding extra memory when needed. The problem with RNNs is that we can't make input/output vectors bigger when needed because that would also make RNNs slower.

Therefore, I'm claiming that RNNs are not *really* TC for practical purposes. Now I'm going to look into Neural Differentiable Computers which, hopefully, solve this problem. I think the only way to achieve practical Turing Completeness is to be smart about effective computations.",23,29,False,self,,,,,

I am currently working on a project to classify time-series data. The data looks like this:

I have a glove that records pressure on my handpalm (64 cells spread across the palm, means 64 dimension of tactile data). Furthermore I also have on top of the glove bending sensors on the finger joints, 18 in numbers. Means here also 18 dimensions of data. 

So I basically have 2 time-series. The 64-dim tactile one and the 18-dim bending one. What would be a good way of preprocessing this? I want to train a LSTM that can classify different objects that one touches/explores. The Problem I have is that this are two different sensor values I get for the both modalities. Is there any way to connect them? First time working with time-series so I am not sure how to approach this. Thank you in advance.",7,18,False,self,,,,,

I am currently training a stacked regressor ensemble, consisting of Neural Network Regressors (1-2 layers, tanh-Activation in hidden, linear in output, inputs normalised to zero mean and unit variance).

The second ""stack layer"" (that means, these networks get the predictions of the first ""stack layer"" as inputs) has an average MSE that is quite above the MSE of the first layer's networks, however, the R^2 Scorer keeps improving, and so does the average real-value of all datasamples that had a prediction in the top 10%.

So, while the error per prediction seems to raise, the models ability to choose the ""top performers"" (in which I am interested) gets better tough.

The explanation I have is that perhaps the average prediction of the network moves further from the average of the real-values, but I cant see why the network - as it is trained using mean squared error as loss function - behaves like this..

So my 2 questions are: 
1) Does somebody have a hint for a perhaps better suited loss function?
2) Any idea why the networks behave in such a way after stacking?

Data flows (be it equations or flow charts) typically follow the same convention, so we can read articles in in a coherent way. Even **trees** (both data structures and decision trees), grow from their roots downwards (so, against their original biological metaphor).

However, in many neural architecture diagrams, this natural convention is broken, with data flowing **from bottom to top**, e.g.:

* [Dropout diagram](http://cs231n.github.io/assets/nn2/dropout.jpeg)
* modules in [Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)

* calling output layers as **top layers** (see `include_top` in https://keras.io/applications/)

Is there some reasoning for this counterintuitive (and potentially - counterproductive) convention?

During the course, I found out that a small percentage of gradients in some of my parameters are as big as in the 25.0 - 30.0 range. This happens consistently over 50k training steps even though all parameters was initialised with standard deviation as small as 0.02. It baffled me though, because there was no gradient exploding, the model was stable, loss went down steadily and the output was as expected. I trained another model with gradient norm clipped to 5 for each individual parameters and the output quality of the two models was basically the same. I find this strange because that kind of big gradients should cause some irregularity in the first model and should have some impacts but turned out it's not. Has anyone else been in the same situation? How did it affect your models (or not)? Would you recommend clipping them even though there's no noticeable effects in the output?",6,6,False,self,,,,,

This extends to conditionalChance like z=and(x,!y) happening more often than randomly. Many random sets include z and x and exclude y so would have bigger stdDev than would be expected randomly.

If all nodes in a layer have equal average, then a random set of them is likely to have a smaller stdDev.

The sum of encrypted bits is near certain to have a small stdDev.

A well trained rbm tends toward exponentially many possible vectors since theres patterns built on patterns such as object vision a few layers above edge detection. The same combination of edges can be matched even places its never been trained, if the individual edges were trained there. Possibilities of patterns multiplied by patterns... gets really big. 

Would a random set of nodes in a well trained RBM have lower stdDev than an overfit RBM?

The GAN doesnt seem to be picking this up). Here's an example:

http://imgur.com/a/ldMnm

They don't really look like anything... I tried the same thing with a huge corpus of landscape paintings I put together and here's the result;

http://imgur.com/a/2lFAT

The results with landscapes are a *little* bit better, but not by much. I think they turned out better because ~~all~~ most of the data follows the same pattern of land at the bottom, maybe trees or something in the middle, and sky at the top. It's easier for the network to learn to generate this since the pattern is simpler. 

I've been trying to generate different types of art using GANs by trying to force it to learn structure, as opposed to color, etc. through the following approach


1. feed the GAN simpler representations of the artwork (in this case, I'm using an edge detection algorithm to generate representations of the artwork that is purely structural - here's an example http://imgur.com/a/hXQcP ). The logic is that if i feed the GAN these representations that only contain structure, there won't be anything else for it to learn (unlike the GAN that i fed the full color artwork that only learned the patterns in color, shading, etc as opposed to structure/shapes - i guess because patterns in color are much more apparent to the network than those in structure/shape)


2. train a pix2pix implementation to go from edges to the artwork equivalent (i already have a huge dataset of nude paintings and their corresponding edges, so this won't be hard)


3. Have the GAN generate edges and run them through pix2pix to get nude-paintings with structure (hopefully).


The bad news is that training the GAN on edges results in something like this: http://imgur.com/a/mG1MS (you're looking at a batch of 64 images generated from the GAN at epoch ~7000). Obviously, generating edges from the paintings wasn't the right approach. My initial thought is to seek some other form of simplified representation of the paintings - maybe like a low resolution ""map"" of the objects in the paintings; perhaps use object segmentation to make a low-resolution flat color version of the paintings, and then train the GAN on those? this way the patterns of color and shading would be reduced to much, much simpler ones, and it might learn patterns of structure instead since there? 

The problem is just getting the GAN to learn structure, so if you guys know of any way I could simplify the input for the GAN to plug into step 1 of my approach instead of edges, that'd be cool, and any other ideas of how I could get the GAN to learn structure would be greatly appreciated. also I know my wording is pretty bad so please don't be afraid to ask what i mean about certain things in the comments.

I've grown desperate for help so I might as well post here, I'm having issues with training semi-supervised GANs. I'm new to Deep Learning projects so I'm not as skillful in debugging which only adds to the pain that GANs already are to train.

Issues by number:

1) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01583.pdf

I have trouble understanding and implementing this paper (with my implementation I keep getting discriminator loss: NaN and of course, mode collapse). 

So first thing I did here is get a batch of 100 mnist examples, 10 examples per class. Then I expanded the MNIST Labels adding an 11th class corresponding to FAKE and the values are set to zero on that 11th member of the vector. Changed the sigmoid from my working DCGAN code to Softmax with 11 nodes, first 10 being digits, 11th being FAKE.
Now for applying the algorithm, the trickiness starts as to understanding the author. He proposes combining 2 m sized batches, m of labeled data and m of generated data for training discriminator. You use the granular labels for supervised training.

I suppose the discriminator loss would look like the softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits?

discriminator_loss_supervised = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=D_logit_real_sample, labels=y))

And as for the unsupervised batches I suppose he figures that we sum the first 10 nodes of the softmax as they correspond to the REAL class in original GAN and act like we got a GAN on our hands?

discriminator_loss_unsupervised = -(tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(D_real_sample_real_prob))+tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(1 - D_gen_sample_real_prob)))

As stated in original GAN algorithm. Generator loss could either minimize:

generator_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(D_gen_sample_real_prob))

or this:

generator_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(1 - D_gen_sample_real_prob))

I figure I must have either terrible understanding of the situation or I got a bug in my code but for the life of me I cannot find it. It doesn't help that GANs are pretty unforgiving with that high number of mode collapses.

Entire code can be found here - https://pastebin.com/67YcjKev

I borrowed plenty from other authors which I intend to reference in my project.

2) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf

Here I encounter similar issues. I use the same DCGAN I used above which worked for me. For generator training I use feature matching as described in the paper instead of those logs of probabilities, I match the conv features of generated and real samples, that means the input to the last, fully connected layer.

Again, although the discriminator losses are precisely stated in the paper, I feel like I'm missing something since I also get NaN as discriminator loss.

The code is actually the same for the losses barring generator loss. Entire code can be found here - https://pastebin.com/0iC9aQAk

I would greatly appreciate any kind of help.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to build a MNIST [cGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) but I'm having a hard time trying to make it converge. I'm trying to follow the architecture they describe, however I'm not sure about this part:
&gt; In the generator net, (...) both z and y are mapped to hidden layers with ReLu activation, with layer sizes 200 and 1000 respectively, before both being mapped to
second, combined hidden ReLu layer of dimensionality 1200. We then have a final sigmoid unit
layer as our output for generating the 784-dimensional MNIST samples.

So, if I understand correctly, z and y are not concatenated at the input, but rather it is their respective hidden layers' activations that are being concatenated right? Something like:
`az = relu(z.dot(W1))`
`ay = relu(y.dot(W2))`
`ah = relu(concat(az, ay).dot(W3))`
Instead of `ah = relu(concat(z, y).dot(W3))`?

The thing that makes me doubt, is that all implementations of models that use Conditional GANs I've seen, don't bother themselves and just concatenate `z`and `y`. I would like to know if there is any particular reasons and which one of the two way should I use?

So, I'm about to start work on a personal project (This will be in Python b/c sklearn and tensorflow.). 

I have my data; I know how my data is structured; I have an idea for how to get the important bits of my data. The only issue is that the JSON file is much much larger than I can fit into my RAM. 

Amount of RAM in my computer -- 8GB

JSON file size -- 56GB

Any advice you can give me on this would be much appreciated.

The classes I want to detect are not all available in one dataset, so I'm trying to combine multiple datasets to create a bigger dataset. Here is the challenge:

Assume dataset1 has classes: dog, cat, bird. And dataset2 has classes: car, airplane, ship. And let's say the model is currently processing an image from dataset1 which happens to have a cat and a car. Since this image is from dataset1, then only the cat is marked as a ground-truth object, and the car is not (i.e. background). This will cause the model to learn that shapes that look like a car are background. And when the model processes an image from dataset2 and it also has a cat and car, this time the car is marked as a ground truth object and the cat is background. So the model will learn that shapes that look like a cat are background.

I have been trying some more advanced neural network projects recently and was wondering if it would be possible to train two NN's against each other. Basically, what I wanted to do was train a NN to play connect four, but then I realized connect four is a 2 player game. So, I'm now wondering if its possible to play two against eachother. I would be using chips placed before loss as the ""success"" measure and to adjust the weights. Would this be possible or is it likely that they would get ""stuck"" somehow?

This was mostly from the point of view of removing all detectable correlations with the censored information (e.g. for privacy or legal purposes).

I have a problem that involves training a low-dimensional auto-regressive model to fill in missing fields in an astronomy dataset (so no legal or privacy concerns here). The model takes all fields as input, but the missing fields are masked out and the model is informed which fields are masked out, and then the probability distribution over each individual missing field is generated one at a time and sampled from to fill in that field. The issue we found is that the masking pattern itself is very informative about the missing values - what is and isn't masked comes from systematic observational biases. So when we perform the fill-in of missing fields in any particular order, the order we choose ends up biasing the distribution of the generated values.

My thought was to use the adversarial censoring trick to remove information about the mask pattern from the intermediate layer of the model. However, this not only removes information about the mask pattern, it removes anything which is correlated with the mask pattern in any way.

With x as the input, m as the mask, and y as the output: the adversarial trick asks for MI(y,m) = 0. But x contains information about y that is duplicated in m, so if the model exploits all of MI(x,y) then that means MI(y,m) &gt; 0 even if the information 'came from' x.

So I'm trying to figure out how to subtract out only the non-duplicated part of the information. That is to say, I should just use the adversary to ensure MI(y,m) &lt;= MI(x,m), rather than zero. Any ideas?",6,1,False,self,,,,,

Then after a bit of free flowing thought I wondered if removing the noise (z) entirely and only have the one-hot labels (y) as the input would convert the problem to supervised learning and I would have fast convergence and great looking results. However when I implemented this, the results looked promising for 5 epochs but then took a wrong turn and the results looked nothing like the MNIST data.

I understand that this defeats the purpose of the paper itself which tries alternatives to the one-to-one mapping of supervised learning.
&gt; A second issue is that much of the work to date has focused on learning one-to-one mappings from input to output. However, many interesting problems are more naturally thought of as a probabilistic one-to-many mapping.

But assuming that I don't mind having a one-to-one mapping, why doesn't conditioning the generator on only the labels (y) as input produce good results? What is the purpose of the noise (z)?

Note: In case you have a complaint that the way I concatenated the noise and labels initially was not part of the original architecture of the paper, here's an interesting discussion from a few days ago about something similar.

Most of them have used popular opensourced database which are 'Frame-Based' classification or pre-segmented clips classification. I think that this idea is not applicable to all Continuous Signal Classification. 
Let me explain it better: We have a guy which show us 'Sign Language'. So firstly we need to see all trajectory of hand, then we can classify the 'sign'. And normally there are many sign is one sequence to create the sentence, where each sign can have different length. Or even worse, we want to automatically translate 'sign language' at film to text. 

This case is different from 'Frame-Based' recognition. And I was thinking that in such case we need to 2 algorithm:

1. Segment video that each clip contain all single sign. Remove clip where no sign occur.
2. Classify that sign

Am I right?
I was reading papers about gesture recognition and it look like that (segmentation of video was based on movement of hand)

Maybe you know how such problem is resolved at ""Lip Reading"" (as each word have different length) and ""Speech Recognition"" (as each word have different length)?

1. Youtube -- speech to text all audio

3. Scrape all forum conversations (including reddit/twitter)
4. Any internal chat datasets between employees
5. (if you're Microsoft) use skype chat dataset
6. (if you're Apple) use iphone chat dataset (not sure what privacy policy is)
7. (if you're Google) use hangouts dataset
8. (if you're facebook), use fb messenger dataset

At this point, you would be looking at a minimum ~10gb of chat data. Now train a very, very large seq2seq model (or ""attention is all you need""). The hidden state size would be somewhere between 16k to 64k. 

Yes, there are problems with max likelihood and there have been some papers trying address text in the adversarial space. But you would think with this much data, it would still produce a very versatile chatbot.
