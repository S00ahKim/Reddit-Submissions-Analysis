1,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2012-1-3,2012,1,3,1,nzvtw,self.MachineLearning,"Ask r/ML: k-means clustering is putting everything in one cluster, how come?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/nzvtw/ask_rml_kmeans_clustering_is_putting_everything/,projector,1325522123,"Hi r/ML,

First, I'm not sure if this subreddit accepts questions like this. Please redirect me if it's better posted elsewhere.

The presenting problem I have is that running k-means clustering on my data set results in almost everything being put in one cluster. I've tried varying the number of clusters but it keeps happening. I'd like to understand why this is happening and what my options are for getting a more even, or more informative, distribution between clusters.

Some background: I've gathered a list of friends and their likes from Facebook, making a sparse matrix like this:

    data = {
        'friend1': ['like1', 'like2', 'like3'],
        'friend2': ['like4'],
        'friend3': ['like1', 'like4'],
    }

There's about 100 friends with about 1 to 300 likes each. I make k centroids, giving each a random set of likes, and count the shared likes for my distance function (dist = 1 - total_shared_likes / 1000).

Each iteration I calculate the distance between a friend and each centroid and assign them to the nearest. Almost all end up in the same centroid. To move the centroids to the average position of their members, I total all the user and centroid likes, then divide by the number of users + 1 (for the centroid's likes). Each users' likes count for 1, but the centroid likes are floats. 

Any thoughts on why this is happening? Am I missing something or doing something wrong? Or is this data set not amenable to k-means, should I try a different algorithm?

Thanks!

**edit** Still getting all friends in the same cluster despite

*(i)* creating a euclidian distance function

    def distance(self, other):
        dist = 0.0
        for i, l in enumerate(self.likes):
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                dist += 1
        
        return math.sqrt(diet)

The likes variables hold tuples where each item is 1 or 0 (like or dislike), and all users' tuples are the same length (equal to the number of all possible items to like). I'm adding 1 if they're different as this is the only possible distance (and it's 1 squared, of course).

*(ii)*

On initialisation, assigning a random friends' likes to the first centroid, then for each other centroid (up to *k*) assigning the likes of the friend furthest from all previous centroids.

*(iii)*

On each iteration, if a centroid has no members, it's assigned the likes of the friend furthest from all centroids.

*(iv)*

No longer including the centroid's likes when calculating the average position between its members.

I've put my code on paste bin as I might have overlooked something - http://pastebin.com/ZFvFfFe3

Here's some example output:

    --- iteration 4
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926, 'members': 174},
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0}}
    --- iteration 5
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926, 'members': 174},
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0},
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0, 'members': 0}}

Thanks for all of your input, I'm very grateful. Please keep posting feedback, I'm set on solving this! 

**edit 2**

Fixed the distance function

    def distance(self, other):
        total_dist = 0.0
        for i, l in enumerate(self.likes):
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                total_dist += (l - other.likes[i])**2

        return math.sqrt(total_dist / len(self.likes))

And the error in the centroid update calculation (line 126)

    new_likes[i] += user_vote

I know that one approach if I had a bunch of points I wanted to classify would be to take the mean and stdev and use it to model the pdf with a guassian classifier.

However, since each ""point"" in my dataset is a [mean,stdev] pair (which itself implicitly defines some distribution) I'm curious as to a way to build a classifier for this type of data.

Hopefully that made sense.

The next step, you digitize the resulting vectors m times for various bin sizes (e.g. 2 bins, 10 bins, 20 bins etc.). Then you hash the resulting vectors and save to a key value store with hashes as key and data labels as value (the hashing step is simply to reduce database size).

Then on the prediction task, you do the random projection and binnings, and then instead of saving to disk, query the hashes. You should get a number of labels back, you take the most common label as your prediction.

I've tried averaging the runs rather than applying the weights immediately, but it only seems to smooth out the learning.

The reason I suspect it's not learning right is as follows.  If I train it on a linear value, say (x, 2*x) for all x in the (0, 1000) or (0,1) with step 0.01, and push some value like (1.0, 1.0), I don't get back (1.0, 2.0).

Without getting too technical, I was wondering if anyone knows a generic source for these. I already found the movieslens one, which worked, but I'd like something that people disagree about a lot more.

The problem with the movielens dataset was that a very small number of movies had a very large percentage of likes and almost everyone agreed that the good movies were really, really good. So in order to optimize for a peak matts correlation (after intelligently breaking apart the graph into a training and testing set) the types of recommendations that came out (while correct) made little sense to humans. For example, when I ignored metadata like genre, Shrek was very high up for people that liked The Matrix. That recommendation would surprise people because those movies are impossibly dissimilar, but the overlap between people that liked The Matrix was very high into liking Shrek (though not the other way around, obviously).

Anyways, I'm pretty amped about what I've built and I'm looking for more validation. Ideally the dataset would have both positive and negative signals, but it's not strictly required. I've got a couple NLP modules in here too, so don't shy away from text heavy content either.

Almost every day I come across digital text objects that belong to sets, that we are describing (in a library kind of way). 

It strikes me that we could be doing things with ML, especially where we have a large set of related files, and the single description we use in library land is 'collection of 'things' from producer 'A' from Jan 1993.'

This collection set might be a hundred text files. I would love to demonstrate to my library colleagues the benefit we could get by automatically extracting key terms (dates, names, places etc) and producing some basic keyword based summary of the collection to augment the chronological record we produce at the moment. An added advantage of running an ML tool over the set would be a I guess to create a full text index that could also be searched - allowing users to search for their own keys amongst the collection. 

Does this sound (1) plausible and (2) achievable - especially if I do it myself, as one with only rudimentary python and even less MYSQL at the end of their finger tips.
