Background: Natural or man made (Color, texture, pattern)         

Judging Distance to camera: Visible texture, Atmospheric diffusion        

Judging distance to background: Shading, lighting  
         
Texture: Metallic - shiny, machine scraped texture, silvery or coppery. Particulates? Fibrous?         

Big or small: Diffusion, visible texture pattern, lighting/shading, blurred close-up effect, using logic relative to size of background

Man Made: Perfect/straight lines + Metallic. Perfect curved surface

It seems like judging scale and distance is the very first step to determining what it is you're looking at. And it seems the best way to do that is to analyze diffusion, texture, camera effects (Blurring), and reasoning out the distance of the background and the object.

Is this currently done?

I work with data that isn't Vision/images, audio or natural text, (Protein sequences). 
I've done a fair bit of work on extracting features from the sequences using a variety of representations (K-mer frequencies, discrete and continuous properties, time-signal representations, etc' ), and have worked with this using mainly SVMs and Random Forests for the best results up until now. 

I'm interested in applying some more ""advanced"" methods to this, mainly:
A) techniques which can take advantage of huge amounts of unlabelled (incredibly heterogenous) samples (i.e. some of the 80 million protein sequences known). 
 From what I know, Deep belief networks, and the various autoencoders + layers of thereof would be a good starting point for this? 
B) Use of multi-layer networks (EG multilayer perceptrons) and other techniques to better classify the data. (In conjunction with A presumably). 

The features are mostly partially linear but weak, (i.e. individually relevant strong features, - a linear SVM does work, but with mediocre performance); And dimensionality of the ""raw"" features is moderately high - ~hundreds to tens of thousands (depending on what type of N-Gram length I extract). 
(I've tried applying PCA but performance dropped). 

I frame this as a binary classification task usually, In most cases my positive set is a few hundred to a few thousand samples, while my negative set is a random sampling from the ""unknown"" background of many millions of proteins not annotated as having the properties of the positive set, (i.e P-U learning framed as a binary case). 
(So - overfitting is a very big issue, even with Cross validation and relatively simple models such as RF/ensembles). 

All my work so far has been with scikit learn (Python 3+). 
 Nolearn and Breze look good, but I haven't managed to get them running on my home Windows PC, while the Lab Linux PC is limited in what I can install. 
Ease of use is a major concern for me, I'm a neophyte with no rigorous background in ML, and I completely lack intuitions when it comes to nets. EG: How many layers to start with? Should they be larger or smaller than the input dimensionality [the literature is conflicted], should the layers go : [Large, medium, small, medium, large], or something else? Does it really make sense to try stacked sparse filtering and to have the first layer be larger than the input dimensionality? (Example from the FastML blog). etc' 

Almost all the literature I've seen really focuses on Images, or audio text, and not ""Here's an unknown dataset, get better results than a RF with it""..  (Again, a sole exception is the FastML ""Kaggle BlackBox challenge"" post).
Thank you very much!


PS -
Here's a basic form of the features and datasets I have in mind:

 If it'll make it easier, imagine I'm giving as an example the Kaggle ""Forest Cover Type Prediction"" challenge. Same issues apply in terms of lack of intuition.

My problem is, I don't think there is existing software which is able to deal with such a input data-structure. Therefore, I'm trying to mitigate this fact by adjusting the network topology to make standard approaches work.

I  know adaboost is particularly bad for this due to the exponential loss function, and hence a Huber loss function would be more robust. 
But what about classification ? There the loss function tends to be deviance or cross-entropy, would one just up-weight the training examples for which you the labels are more robust ? 
Is there a  robust-loss function you can use for classification ? 
Is there any consensus if NN or RF are more robust to mislabeled data ?

Would you get a job offer if you broke some important machine learning benchmark?  Or won a competition?  Would that be enough?

Do you really need to be at one of these places like DeepMind to be at the cutting edge of the field?  I mean, a lot of the job openings for DeepMind seem to be more mundane stuff, i.e. stuff where on the day to day, you might just be coding on a need to know basis, and be kept in the dark about the bigger picture stuff.

The reason I want to get a job at DeepMind, is after hearing Elon Musk's comment about how within 5 years A.I. is going to be dangerous.  I know what a true A.I. could do, and basically, if someone had a true A.I. with the IQ of a human, they could take over the world within 2 years.  That is not a joke.  Once it reached human level intelligence it could boostrap itself up to 100x or 1,000x a human, and then we are talking about a machine that could invent things we can't even imagine and do it in a matter of hours or minutes.

So, do you think that DeepMind is so much ahead of the rest of the field that they could do this?  I mean, we already heard from a very rational person who claims they have ""Superintelligences"".  Seeing how close deep learning is to the way the human brain works, I think it is very plausible, especially with the money and talent Google is undoubtedly throwing at it.

Another bad scenario would be that the government is going to realize what a weapon A.I. is and they will make it completely illegal.

I define intelligence as ability to predict &amp; plan, which can only be done by discovering &amp; projecting patterns.

I have my finals coming up and I'm enrolled in a Machine Learning course at my university. The course is not very well taught and I had been doing the Andrew NG course on Coursera before the semester began. Due to certain other responsibilities, I was unable to complete the Coursera course. My finals are in 2 days and the finals has a complete section with Modelling problems.
 
The course has been taught in such a way that it is completely theoretical and less application focused. I messed up in this regards and didn't pay much attention to the application area of ML.
The professor has focused on Decision trees, ANN's, SVMs, Clustering, Bayesian Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Ensemble Classifiers, Active learning and Dimensionality reduction methodologies. 

Is there any resource available which gives a side by side comparison of the application of these algorithms to various problems or just a repository of Machine learning modelling problems with their solutions so that I can get into that particular mindset which would be helpful to me at this point of time.

I know I messed up this semester, I would really appreciate it if you guys could help me out at this late hour.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

So lets say I have a dataset that I'm training a random forest model on, and I do 100 simulations, generating a new random forest each time, and I get a new model with a new associated classification accuracy each time.

What is a rational approach to selecting the ""optimal"" random forest model? Just selecting the one with the highest accuracy on a particular set of training data doesn't seem like a good metric.

Would this approach make sense?
-Generate 100 random forests on 100 different partitions of the test data
-Measure the classification accuracy of each of the random forests on 100 partitions of the test data (ie, 100 random forests * 100 tests each = 10,000 tests total)

I have used scikit for forests in the past, but I've never had to use categorical variables. Based on what I've read, these seem to be the immediately obvious pros and cons for the two...

* R can handle categorical variables without any transformation
* R can't handle categorical variables that have more than 32 levels (and I'm using state). The ability to use categorical variables might not matter
* R can choose a multiple levels from a category at a specific branch. If I have a dummy variable for each label in a category, this is not possible
* Creating a single numeric variable for categories in scikit implies ordinality. Creating a dummy variable for each level of each categorical variable could drastically increase data size and dimensionality
It seems like there are pros and cons to each.

Unless my understanding of ordinality in integer labeled categories is wrong, it seems like a branch in a scikit can't accomplish the same level of interaction that one in R could because R could split on multiple values of a categorical variable instead of one value at a time. At the same time, I wouldn't even be able to pass a few of my categories into R because of the label limit. With sufficiently deep trees and sufficiently large forests, would this difference in implementation even matter?

1. Compute mfcc for two wav samples using https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features (I will eventually replace it with my own mfcc algorithm)

2. Compute l2 norm for the top 13 mfcc in order

3. Traverse through the dtw matrix and find the least distance.

I have up to 20 weekends and more of historical data of matches played and i would like to see how weka can predict the outcome of matches played within that 20 week period.

My data is in tabular form and it is stored in microsoft word.
It is a forecast of football matches played in the past.

Pattern detection is the key, By poring over historical data of matches played in the past, patterns begin to emerge and i use this to forecast what the outcome of matches will be for the next game.

I use the following attributes for detecting patterns and making predictions which on paper is always 80-100% accurate but when i make a bet, it fails.
(results, team names, codes, week's color, row number) 

Results= Matches that result in DRAWS

Team names = Believe it or not, teams names are used as parameters to make predictions, HOW? They begin with Alphabets.

Codes= These are 3-4 strings either digits or a combo of letters and digits, depending on where they are strategically placed in the table, they offer insight into detecting patterns.

Weeks Color= In the football forecasting world, there are 4 colours used to represent each week in a month. RED, BLUE, BROWN and PURPLE. These also allows the forecaster to see emerging patterns.

Row Number= Each week, the data is presented in a table form with two competing teams occupying a row and a number is associated with that row. These numbers are used to make preditions. 

So i would like to TEACH WEKA how i detect these patterns so that my task can be automated and tweaked anyhow i like it.

In plain english, how do i write out my ""pattern detecting style"" for weka to understand and how do i get this information loaded into weka for processing into my desired results.
Going by my scenario, What will be my attributes? 
What will be my instances? 
What will be the claasifiers? 
What algorithms do i use to achieve my aim or will i need to write new algorithms?

I sincerely hope someone will come to my rescue.

Backpropagation as well as Boltzmann machines rely on bidirectional connections that allow information to flow in either direction ~~unidirectional connections~~. In backpropagation the error signal is propagated backwards through the connections to the pre-synaptic neuron, while in Boltzmann machines the weights are assumed to be tied. However, I came across this slide in a talk by Geoffery Hinton, in which he claims that the weights in a Boltzmann machine do not necessarily need to be tied (see Reference). Can anyone refer me to a paper on this? Has someone derived the equations for a Boltzmann machine with purely directed connections?

I am trying to teach a multilayer perceptron to do an auto-association task but I can't get it to work properly. I have little experience with neural networks so I thought that the solution to my problem could be obvious for you guys. I tried many sets of parameters (size of hidden layer and learning rate) on my relatively simple implementation of the backprop rule, but without success. My inputs are images of black and white fish. The problem that I have is that the cost always seems to plateau after a while, and instead of giving me the same output as my input after the training, I get a kind of prototype fish for all inputs. I tried to lower my learning rate but it doesn't seem to be helping.

I have a sigmoid activation for my hidden and output units. My inputs are all vector with 8064 binary features. My cost function is the following:

    def cost(pred,y,_lambda,w1,w2):
        m = pred.shape[0]
        J = np.sum(np.power(pred - y,2))/(2*m)

I am trying to build a NaiveBayesClassifier with that and then I want to pass in genres and for it to tell me if it is relevant or irrelevant
I currently have the following:

    import nltk
    trainingdata =[({'drama': True, 'mystery': True, 'horror': True, 'psychological': True}, 'relevant'), ({'drama': True, 'fantasy': True, 'romance': True, 'adventure': True, 'science fiction': True}, 'unrelevant')]
    classifier = nltk.classify.naivebayes.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(trainingdata)
    classifier.classify({'Fantasy': True, 'Comedy': True, 'Supernatural': True})
    prob_dist = classifier.prob_classify(anime)
    print ""relevant "" + str(prob_dist.prob(""relevant""))
    print ""unrelevant "" + str(prob_dist.prob(""unrelevant""))

I currently have :
    
    size of training array:110
    the relevant length 57
    the unrelevant length 53

Some results I receive :

    relevant Tantei Opera Milky Holmes TD
    {'Mystery': True, 'Comedy': True, 'Super': True, 'Power': True}
    relevant 0.518018018018
    unrelevant 0.481981981982

    relevant Juuou Mujin no Fafnir
    {'Romance': True, 'Fantasy': True, 'School': True}
    relevant 0.518018018018
    unrelevant 0.481981981982

I was wondering if that makes sense... Since I am getting the same relevant probability for each classification it makes.. 
From my understanding of Naive Bayes it shouldn't be doing that... 

using python, nltk

There are a few things that I'm confused about.  

1.  In my experiments, training diverges if I use any type of distribution where regions with no density touch regions with high density.  An extreme example of this is discrete distributions where all of the mass is concentrated at single points.  

I think that this happens because there's a strong penalty for the generator assigning probability density to places where there shouldn't be any mass.  

In the paper, the authors consider two different losses for the generator:  

a: -1.0 * log(D(G(z)))

b: log(1.0 - D(G(z)))

As D(G(z)) -&gt; 0.0, the first loss approaches infinity and the second loss approaches 0.0.  

As D(G(z)) -&gt; 1.0, the first loss approaches 0.0 and the second loss approaches negative infinity.  

I think that the second loss is much better if the true distribution has discontinuities, because it allows the network to put some amount of mass in places that shouldn't have any mass without facing a severe penalty.  I did a simple experiment where I trained the model to reproduce a mixture of a normal distribution and a gamma distribution.  The gamma distribution has a discontinuity which the first loss has a hard time handling: 

Loss a: 

http://imgur.com/bo7TYfJ

Loss b: 

http://imgur.com/MoIZIx4

In both cases green is the true distribution, blue is the generated distributed, and the dots are D(G(z)) from the discriminator.  As you can see, the second loss performs a lot better.  Nonetheless, the paper advocates for the use of the first loss in section 3.  

Perhaps there's another loss for the generator that gets the benefits of both?  

2.  I've found that the generator is a lot harder to optimize than the discriminator.  

3.  The experimental results in the paper are for real data.  Has anyone done experiments showing that the model is calibrated for synthetic data?  ",8,3,False,self,,,,,

There are 30 attributes and ~400k samples broken up 80/20 but after rejecting bad data the useable rows end up being around ~40k.

My goals are to go to grad school studying statistics and ML and eventually work in industry.  I will probably take a pitstop in industry before going to grad school.  

The main points I've been debating with myself are:

* *Analysis is a critical course for future math study and having more will help with grad school applications.*

* *ML is my fix and I want to study it in grad school.*

* *Studying ML seriously will require more Analysis, and the sooner the better.*

* *MLwill help land an interesting job if I never make it to grad school.*

One way would be to use rJava [2] and call R from Java but I will need to do this over 100,000 times so I can imagine that will take a while. Thus if I can access the SVM it uses without the overhead of R, everything will be much quicker!

Or an alternative would be to use an SVM which has a similar parameter training method to the one used in caret [3] as that seems to work relatively well. Other SVMs seem to favour one class on the prediction. The data used is class balanced, min-max normalised, though I haven't done too much investigation into parameter searching - RBF kernel, I tend to set the cost to between 1 and 100, and gamma as 1/num_features.

$\Sigma_{i=1}^{k}(d_i - 1) \Pi_{j \in n(i)}d_j$.

I have an idea which seems like, if polished, would give a good greedy solution, but I know something like this is sure to have been done already or there's a better way to do it; so what I'm looking for is some suggestion on papers to look at to accomplish what I'm trying to do. 

The algorithm I have in mind goes as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

The objective is to maximize function f(a,b,c), where a,b,c can take on values in some finite sets A,B,C. 

Base solution = f(a0,b0,c0)

Depth one branches are f(a1,b0,c0), f(a0,b1,c0), f(a0,b0,c1)

Depth two branches are f(a2,b0,c0), f(a0,b2,c0), f(a0,b0,c2)

Depth n branches are f(an, b0, c0), f(a0, bn, c0), f(a0, b0, cn)  
&amp;nbsp;

So you have a tree like:

                       f(a0,b0,c0)
            /                |                \
    f(a1,b0,c0)         f(a0,b1,c0)        f(a0,b0,c1)    
          |                  |                  |
    f(a2,b0,c0)         f(a0,b2,c0)       f(a0,b0,c2)
          |                  |                  |
         ...                ...                ...

If the first depth branches has a better solution than the base, that branch becomes the new base; next round.

Otherwise, move to the next depth and search the branches.

Each depth's branches are just the previous root's parameter index + 1. So for example if f(a1,b0,c0) is a better solution, it becomes the base and the next tree is


                       f(a1,b0,c0)
            /                |                \
    f(a2,b0,c0)         f(a1,b1,c0)        f(a1,b0,c1)    
          |                  |                  |
    f(a3,b0,c0)         f(a1,b2,c0)       f(a1,b0,c2)
          |                  |                  |
         ...                ...                ...

Maybe machine learning can provide an answer.  Sorry to veer from hardcore machine learning, this is more of a philosophical question.  I think that the statement in the title is true.  For example, a non-intelligent program couldn't create a cartoon that satrizes something, that would require intelligence.  Cartoons are a type of art.  It applies to other art as well, I just chose cartoons because it seemed easier to explain by starting from there because some paintings do appear that they could be created by non-intelligent generative processes, (jackson pollack) which brings the question of whether that is true art.

It could be that ""function spaces"" of things/images/audio that can only be generated by human level intelligence, may be of interest to our brain and make us feel awe or curiousity precisely because they are from a different class of functions which look completely different from the patterns we see in nature. So since our visual system and auditory system is so attuened to compressing and processing the information in natural systems, when we see something which breaks many rules of structure that we are used to, it is very exciting for our perception.

edit: also, I dont want to get into an argument on whether science and math can be art as well.

Background:
As an exercise, I would like to do a binary classification on URLs. To figure out if they are spam or benign.  
(Some people say this may not be the best way to detect spam... but thats another issue. This is an exercise more than anything)


So, given a URIs like this:

Ftp://foobarhost:123/some/path

Http://1234Host.com/some/other/path?some=query&amp;string=true


One of the feature groups will be the  Scheme (Protocol)  i.e  FTP | HTTP | HTTPS  etc..


I am representing this as a binary categorical feature vector where the value is either 0 or 1:

&lt;FTP, HTTP, HTTPS&gt;


then we have other feature vectors based on the other parts of the URI  (host, path, query etc)


Note: The reason we keep separate feature vectors for all of the feature groups is that for example the word Foo means completely different things depending on where in the URI we see it

.
.
.
When we have fully built all of these feature group vectors, we would like to combine all of them to become our input. This works well


BUT, what can we do if for example we come across a new Scheme/Protocol  FooBar:// and grow the  Scheme feature group?  If we grow that feature vector, then when we combine  the index where the next feature group started would mean something completely different.


Example: Before growing this is our categorical input vector:

 [Scheme][Host bag of words   ]

&lt;Http, Ftp, foo, bar, moo, woof,....&gt;


After growing our Scheme feature group this is what it will look like:

 [       Scheme      ][Host bag of words   ]

&lt;Http, Ftp,**HTTPS** foo, bar, moo, woof,....&gt;

So everything after index 2 means something completely different than it used to before growing the feature vector



You might say, just add it to the end of the end of the combined feature vector... but how do you keep track of that particular feature being at that index?

Every epoch, the ""least useful"" 1% of nodes in a fully connected neural net are removed, and a new 1% of nodes are added randomly and randomly initialised.

""Least useful"" nodes are determined by looking at d(Node output value)/d(Loss Function) averaged across a large number of training examples.

Adding layers can be done by inserting a new ""unity"" layer between two existing layers, which has all parameters set to just pass through data unmodified (and no nonlinear elements), but it can then have new non-unity nodes added through the above mechanism.

One can imagine there are (sometimes non-trivial) extensions to this idea to apply to other layer types too.

I am especially wondering how you make your code interface well with gradient methods.

Numpy functionality seems a must, but storing parameters in separate named arrays has two weaknesses as I see it.

* Operating on the entire parameter set, e.g. adding a gradient, is impossible, so you have to write the operation for each array of parameters explicitly.
* If you have variations of the model with only a subset of the parameters inheritance becomes difficult to work with.

Storing everything in a single array/vector seems like a terrible solution as the code would become unintelligible. So what is a better way to do it? A dictionary so you can loop over the parameters? A Pandas Panel frame? A parameter class with its own update method?

Would there be any significant overhead on using a dictionary of a few large arrays and then looping over the keys, as opposed to writing each operation explicitly? ",5,2,False,self,,,,,

http://web.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs81/s12/papers/MarkStevePaper.pdf

In order to approx. Q(S,A) I use a neural network structure like the following,

 - Activation sigmoid
 - Inputs, number of inputs + 1 extra for the Action (All Inputs Scaled 0-1)
 - Outputs, single output. Q-Value
 - N number of M Hidden Layers.
 - Exploration method random 0 &lt; rand() &lt; propExplore

At each learning iteration I run all action/state pairs through the neural network either pick one at random or choose the one with the highest Q-Value then using the following formula,

http://i.stack.imgur.com/e3hgc.png

I calculate a Q-Target value then calculate an error using,

    error = QTarget - LastQValueReturnedFromNN

and the neural network using this error.

Q1, Am I on the right track? I have seen some papers that implement a NN with one output neuron for each action.

Q2, My reward function returns a number between -1 and 1. Is it ok to return a number between -1 and 1 when the activation function is sigmoid (0 1)

Q3, From my understanding of this method given enough training instances it should be quarantined to find an optimal policy wight? When training for XOR sometimes it learns it after 2k iterations sometimes it won't learn even after 40k 50k iterations. Is this because random is random or am I missing something.

I've come across a really crazy bug happening to me in coding backpropagation for an RNN in pure python.

The weirdest bug is that I'm getting the last row of weights correct for the input -&gt; hidden layer connections, but the rest are incorrect. I.e, I'm correctly figuring out the derivative of the weights from the 5th unit of the first layer to each unit in the hidden layer, but none of the rest. All info is here:

They do not explain the details of how they tie together the network, but from following the references I get the impression that they are using a connection structure like this: http://i.imgur.com/J3DwxSF.png (from ""Hybrid speech recognition with deep bidirectional LSTM"" http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/asru_2013.pdf ), except using LSTM units.  

If they were using a deep RNN, though, I would think that a connection like this would work better: http://i.imgur.com/9txOrbN.png .  The difference is that I feed the output of the whole network into the input at the next time step, instead of feeding each layer's outputs into the same layer's inputs at the next time step.  

Why do they do it this way?  

Also, is there a good, modern reference that compares and contrasts approaches to recurrent neural networks?  For example, I would like to know: 

* Why are these special memory units better than a simple (possibly deep) recurrent neural network (RNN)?  

* Is there any good understanding of the difference between LSTM units and the simpler memory units introduced in ""Learning Phrase Representations using RNN EncoderDecoder for Statistical Machine Translation"" ([arXiv:1406.1078](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078))?  It seems like this paper gets good results even with a shallow network (they use only one layer of hidden units). 

* Do any neural network packages have good built-in support for RNNs and these variants?  
So far, I have found LISA Groundhog https://github.com/lisa-groundhog/GroundHog and some simpler theano examples (like https://github.com/gwtaylor/theano-rnn).

My code is quite straight forward, i set a particular weight in the output layer in a loop and then assign:


err=((target[0]-output[0])*(target[0]-output[0]))/2;

dtErr=(target[0]-output[0])*NeuralNetwork::derivativeSigmoid(output[0], 1);


When plotted for w [-1,1] i should get the MSE and its derivative, right?
Wrong.

I get MSE, but instead of derivative I get the inverse derivative, meaning it's positive when MSE is climbing. Now what. MSE is quadratic, so switching (t-y)^2 to (y-t)^2 would give the same result, but the derivative would then be (y-t), which would actually plot the correct graph. But of course, making that change in the neural net corrupts it.

What am I missing? Why is that derivative positive when it should be negative and why is that ok??

Let's say I'm faced with this problem: A user has to choose among 10 options. Each option draws from a 5D random variable, let's say X = [is_black, is_sedan, is_cheap, is_fast, is_efficient] (pretty sure that's not standard notation, sorry). Each dimension is binary. If you are given 100 users, how would you model this problem in order to make good predictions on what future users would choose? This is what I've tried so far:

Combining the data from all of the observations (where one observation is one user selecting among 10 options), and unrolling each observation such that 10 rows were produced per observation, each containing X's outcome, and an additional output column y where y = 1 if the user chose the car and 0 otherwise, I split the data into a training and test set and fed the training set into a random forest, logistic regression, and SVM. The test results were pitiful.

I then figured that I was discarding important information by ""unrolling"" each user choice into independent rows. So then I processed the test data into chunks of 10 (since we know that a user must make a choice), and picked the highest raw scoring row as the predicted choice using SVM and logreg. This too performed poorly. For fun I also tried just using the raw counts of each possible outcome of X seen in the training data and using that as a ""probability"" of each option being chosen, and selecting the highest. This too did poorly.

I don't know how I would represent each observation without unrolling it as I had done to make it suitable for the algorithms I have chosen. I.e., training in a way that preserves the idea that a choice was made among each observation. My first thought is, if that were done, you would be training multiple models on tiny batches of 10, and that doesn't seem like a good idea.

Am I on the wrong track here? Does anyone have any better ideas or suggestions?

Some questions I now have are:
With popularity of deep nets and auto encoders, is this problem interesting anymore? 
Given that we can automatically learn interesting characteristics, does it make sense to look at this problem? Why not just learn everything?

I started to read about auto-encoders a short time ago and I am trying to imagine how I could employ an under-complete AE (I'm considering the simplest scenario possible, no denoising, only with a hidden layer).

The idea of reconstructing the input in the output layer seems trivial to me, but I just can't understand how it is possible to apply the backpropagation algorithm in the training phase if one considers W in the encoder and W' the decoder. Furthermore, what advantages or disadvantages will I have if I use tied weights and why that simple property assures me those advantages? And how do I assure that both matrices will continue to be transpose when I backpropagate the error?

I am performing document (text) classification on the category of websites, and use the website content (tokenized, stemmed and lowercased) as the feature set for my data.

My problem is that I have two over-represented categories which has vastly more data points than any other (roughly 70% or 4000~ of my data points are of his one of these two categories, while about 20 other categories make up the last 30%, some of which have fewer than 50 data points). I had a couple questions as to how I could improve on this:

1. What could I do to improve the accuracy of my classifier in this case of sparse data for some of the labels? Should I simply discard a certain proportion of the data points in the category which is over-represented? Should I use something other than Gaussian Naive Bayes with tf-idf?

2. After I perform the classification, I save the tfidf vector as well as the classifier to disk. However, when I re-rerun the classification on the same data, I sometimes get different results from what I initially got (for example, if previously a data point was classified as ""Entertainment"", it might receive ""News"" now).

Any advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2q85pn/backprop_gradient_twice_as_big_as_finite/,ledmmaster,1419378880,"Hey guys,

I am programming a neural network from scratch in Python, and when I do a numerical check of the backpropagation gradient, I see numbers like the following example: 

Gradient: -0.0375543629722
Finite difference: 0.0187042723576 

The analytical gradient is around twice as big (ignoring the sign) as the finite difference.

I am using the following formula for the numerical gradient:

f(x + eps) - f(x - eps) / 2*eps

For the single unit sigmoid output layer I am using the following analytical gradient: (target - prediction) * activation_of_hidden_unit

It's based on the cross-entropy loss, and uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (maybe it has something to do with it?).

The network trains and generalizes, but I am curious and a little bit worried about this gradient problem.

If you need more details, please tell.

Thank you for your help!",4,2,False,self,,,,,

Just wrote up my first Neural Network Class in python. Everything as far as I can tell should work, but there is some bug in it that I can't seem to find(Probably staring me right in the face). 

I first tried it on 10,000 examples of the MNIST data, then again when trying to replicate the sign function, and again when trying to replicate a XOR Gate. Every time, regardless of the # of epochs, it always produces output from all the output neurons(regardless of how many there may be) that are all roughly the same value, but the cost function seems to be going down. 

I am using batch gradient descent, all done using vectors(no loop for each training example).

I even implememented Gradient Checking and the values are different, and I thought I would try replacing the Back Propagation updates with the Approx. Gradient Checking values, but that gave the same results, causing me to doubt even my Gradient Checking code.

Cost:
Before Training: 0.508019225507
After Training 0.50007095103 (After 10000 Epochs)

[ 0.49317733]
 [ 0.49294556]
 [ 0.50489004]
 [ 0.50465824]

If you haven't read and don't want to read the article, or are unfamiliar with okcupid and the question system, here's the data and problem he had:

The goal is to ""match"" as highly as possible with as many users as possible, each of whom may have answered an arbitrary number of questions.  These questions may have between 2 and 4 answers each, and for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that the formula for a match% between you and another user is the sum of your matching answers, divided by the total number of matching questions (denominator = # of questions you have in common, numerator = # of those questions you answered the same way).  The real formula is slightly more complex, but the approach would be the same regarding ""picking"" a correct answer (he actually used boosting to find the ideal ""importance"" to place on a given question, rather than the right answer).

In any case, the point is you want to pick a certain value for each question, such that you maximize your match% with as many users as possible - something you might quantify by the sum of match% over all users.

Now I've watched the [MIT course on AI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi) up to and including the lecture on boosting, but I don't understand how you would apply it to a problem like this.  Honestly I don't even know where to begin with choosing rules for the weak learners.  I don't have any ""rules"" about what values to choose for each question (if the user is under 5'5, choose A, etc) - I'm just trying to fit the data I have.

Is this not the way boosting is supposed to be used?  Is there likely some other optimization left out of how he figured this out?",4,6,False,self,,,,,

I've been trying to implement FTRL proximal for the avuzu competition(ads click rate prediction) on Kaggle. However I'm a begginer in ML and I'm unsure about some aspects of this algorithm.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

I've been using this [paper](http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/ad-click-prediction.pdf).  
  
&amp;nbsp;

Am I justified in using FTRL proximal instead of simple online gradient descent in this particular contest considering there are only about 30 features? From what I've understood the advantage over OGD is that it introduces sparsity and reduces memory usage when storing the weights. But since there are only 30 features and we are only storing 2 weight vectors at any time in OGD (unless I'm mistaken about that part) why go through the trouble of using FTRL?  
Am I missing another advantage or did I misunderstand something?  
   
&amp;nbsp;

On a side note the paper talks about feature vectors with billions of coefficient and that really boggles my mind. How do they even find that many features in the behavior of online users... even using high polynomial features...  
  
&amp;nbsp;

My second problem is the implementation itself, there is a nice one in the kaggle forum but I figured I'd try to do my own before looking at it. Here is [mine](https://github.com/EtienneDesticourt/Kaggle-Avuzu/blob/master/FTRLProx.py), lines 50 to 80 is ftrl proximal.  
I can't seem to pinpoint the problem, I've tried with up to 100 000 training examples, many different parameters( alpha, beta, l1, l2), with as few as one feature but nothing seems to make it converge and I have an accuracy of 0.5 whereas simple batch logistic regression gets ~0.94. So all I can think of is an error in my implementation. I've copied the Algorithm 1 from the paper page 2 but before (and after) doing so I've read multiple times the theory(page 2-3) to try and understand what I was doing, yet it still doesn't work.
I wish I could pinpoint more precisely my problem before asking but I just don't know what's wrong, I'm sorry.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

I'd be very grateful for any help answering these two questions.

Cheers

The human brain did not have its features designed, and the ability of the brain to adapt and relocate functionality suggests that it has the ability to layout/allocate/design new networks.

One apparent thing that hints at the adaptability of the human NNs is its ability to work with alphabets of varying lengths. It does not appear to be pre-programmed for an alphabet with 20 symbols or whatever - it can work with large alphabets.

Also useful for pre-training of deep belief nets or things like that.

Anyway, a lot of the data I'm working with is real-valued data. Sometimes it's integers between, say, 1 and 20, and sometimes it's real values between 0 and 1,000,000 that are approximately exponentially distributed. I say ""real values,"" but really it's rounded to the nearest 100th. It's distributed according to a real distribution, for all intents and purposes, but it doesn't require a great deal of precision in terms of decimal points.

So I was toying with the idea of setting up a so-called ""Exponential-Family Harmonium,"" but I would need to use some kind of weird Energy formulation with mixed data types, since some of my input vector coordinates are binary values, some are binomially distributed, and some are maybe exponential or Gaussian. But it occurred to me that I could convert all of my real-valued entries into binary digits and use a standard RBM.

My question: would that actually work? That is, would converting all non-binary numbers into binary (and then just using a normal Restricted Boltzmann Machine trained with Contrastive Divergence) work? What kind of internal representation of the data would my algorithm come up with? Would it actually make sense when I run the program backwards to generate new examples of data?

What algorithms and data structures should I get really comfortable with if I want to get more comfortable with implementing machine learning algorithms (and I guess general ""data science"")?

I figure some kind of tree would make a lot of sense (especially for decision trees and random forests), but I don't know what algorithms tend to be used most commonly.  I also get the impression that Bloom filters are used a lot but can't find much information on implementations.

Additionally, should I try implementing them in a lower-level language?  I'm not a fan of Java, but it seems like a lot of newer good linear algebra libraries are written in C++.  I don't know C++, but would it be worth learning if I wanted to get involved in machine learning?

I'm currently studying to get another Master's degree, with elements of machine learning, neural networks and computational neuroscience: perhaps it's a little unnecessary, but I like to learn and could afford it and so I decided to treat myself a little. Furthermore, I'm supplementing it by MOOCs and individual study (I'm currently going through Murphy's book). My personal - and, admittedly, possibly quite flawed - impression is that, if I maintain the current pace, at the end of the next semester I should have a pretty solid (if still imperfect, obviously) understanding of the most common elements of machine learning.

Is this reasonably feasible, as a longish-term objective, or am I talking nonsense?

I try to implement it and find that the bias term is not as usual as the bias term which generated by LBFGS. In my opinio, the bias term should represent the average output of a LR model. However, the bias term LR model trained by the online SGD is very different from that trained by LBFGS. Anyone knows it?",6,0,False,self,,,,,
