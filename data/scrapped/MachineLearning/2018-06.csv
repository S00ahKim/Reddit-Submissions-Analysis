During those four months I met experts in the field, read books, followed courses, built a portfolio and passed several interviews.

Since I got the job I wanted I am updating my pdf CV. But I am not sure in which section to add this experience in LinkedIn. I want to add it in the ""Experience"" section, with the title ""Skill Acquisition"", describing what I wrote above.

The ""Company"" field is required in to fill up ""Experience"" but I was working on my own, without being paid or any company involved. And I don't want to write it in ""Education"" because I don't want to have a four months gap when you look at my experiences \(I already travelled after my studies\).

I'm working with the [LiTS Dataset](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094#participate) \(liver tumor\), which contains several CT Scans, each 512x512xN \(N layers, varying between 75 and 861 layers per file\). The code I used is in [this](https://github.com/albatroz95/thesis/blob/master/preprocess.py) repository, if you can give it a look I would appreciate it! I've been trying to preprocess the data in 2 ways.

First, I **resized the resolution** of the Dataset to \(128, 128\), as it reduces memory load and training time, which was successful for both CT volumes and respective masks.

Now I am trying to **normalize the number of layers** so each file would have N layers in the z axis. To do so, I used the following code:

    def chunks(l, n):
        """"""Yield successive n-sized chunks from l.""""""
        for i in range(0, len(l), n):
            yield l[i:i + n]
    
    
    def mean(a):
        return sum(a) / len(a)
    
    
        chunk_sizes = math.ceil(len(slices) / hm_slices)
    
        new_slices = []
        for slice_chunk in chunks(slices, chunk_sizes):
            slice_chunk = list(map(mean, zip(*slice_chunk)))
            new_slices.append(slice_chunk)

Where `slices` is a list with the original file's data, `hm_slices` represents the new value for N, `chunk_sizes` is the number of layers per chunk. So basically if the original file has 100 layers and I want to convert it to 20, it will be divided in 20 different chunks, each being computed by the mean of 5 adjacent layers.

It worked well with the original scans, but it was a mess with the segmented images. The problem is that although they have 3 integer classes, 0 for background, 1 for liver, and 2 for tumor, when they go through this algorithm the array comes back as floats due to the mean function being used. Also the binary function is useless because I have 3 classes. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advanced!",5,0,False,self,,,,,

**\&lt;The analyzing AUC is better than Top\-\(n\) accuracy when we have small and imbalanced training dataset\&gt;**

When we train a CNN model, we sometimes get a disappointing Top\-1 accuracy. I also had suffered this problem and I did not understand exactly what was wrong. When the early version of the 12DX paper \([https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022\-202X\(18\)30111\-8/fulltext](https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(18)30111-8/fulltext)\) was reviewed in JAMA dermatology 2 years ago, the biggest reason for rejection was low Top\-1 accuracy.

However, unlike general object recognition studies, it is very difficult to determine the results with Top\-1 accuracy, and it is important that the AUC value of ROC curve can be high even with a low Top\-1 accuracy. If you look carefully, most of medical AI researches have used the AUC rather than Top\-\(n\) accuracy.

Because of small and imbalanced training data in medical researches, the analysis of each class as Top\-\(n\) accuracy is inadequate \(but the mean value of Top\-\(n\) of all classes is meaningful\). Top\-\(n\) accuracy of each classes vary whenever we repeat training of CNN with an imbalanced dataset. Therefore, we should see the corrected value while using thresholds of each classes, that is the AUC value of ROC curve.

With good AUC results, we published ""12DX; Classification of the Clinical Images for Benign and Malignant Cutaneous Tumors Using a Deep Learning Algorithm"" \([https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022\-202X\(18\)30111\-8/fulltext](https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(18)30111-8/fulltext)\). However, there was a debate that our algorithm is not sensitive \(low top\-1 accuracy\) with ISIC dataset \(Automated Dermatological Diagnosis: Hype or Reality?; [https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022\-202X\(18\)31991\-2/fulltext](https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(18)31991-2/fulltext)\).

**\&lt;Classifying tumorous nodule is much difficult than determining whether it is malignant or not\&gt;**

There was an additional problem as well as the Top accuracy problem. When we analyze a clinical image, ""the problem of judging whether it is melanoma or not"" is easier than ""the problem of matching the type of cancer"".

Analyzing the output of the CNN is equivalent to solve ""the problem of matching the type of cancer"". Therefore we need to analyze the ratio of output, if we want to solvethe problem of judging ""whether cancer or not"".

We interpreted the ratio of melanoma output and nevus output rather than using melanoma output alone.

*RATIO \(Melanoma Index\) = melanoma output / \(melanoma output \+ nevus output\)*

The clinical image of skin cancer consists of a nodular lesion and a background. If you want to concentrate on only the lesion, we need to analyze it with RATIO as above to get more accurate results.

In the attached photograph \([https://i.imgur.com/jnZUavi.png](https://i.imgur.com/jnZUavi.png)\), \(b\) is ""matching what cancer is"" and \(a\) is judging ""whether it is cancer or not"". \(a\) is much better than \(b\). The AUC for diagnosing melanoma jumps from 0.69 to 0.91.

I am wondering, though, what is the process for when there are several features of an input, i.e. multiple sentences (not necessarily in the same paragraph) that contribute to the eventual class? Perhaps like a row of tabular data that has some integers, some sentences, something like that.

I have about 5 years of software development experience (web/mobile enterprise applications)
and recently went back to school full time to study math. I wanted to build a foundation for
better understanding ML/AI and take first steps towards transitioning my career into a research
oriented role in ML/AI.

So far I've completed 2 semesters Algebra, 2 semesters Real Analysis, Into to Complex Analysis,
Linear Models (regression), Number Theory and a smattering of basic CS courses taken during summer
semesters.

Fall 2018 will be my last semester before returning to industry. It's possible that I'll get
into a good grad school and do a masters in CS or Math, but more likely I'll just go back to
industry (maybe a concurrent part time masters in Math).

I'm trying to decide between taking pure math courses or more upper level stats.

I am definitely taking Graduate Linear Algebra and have room for about 2.5 more
math/stats/cs courses. The options are (all undergraduate level unless noted)

Topology,
Optimization,
Probability Models (focus on Markov Chains),
Design/Analysis of Experiments,
Graduate Soft Computing (applications of fuzzy sets)

What would you recomend I take and why?

Abstract:

Variational autoencoders \(VAEs\) have shown a promise in data\-driven conversation modeling. However, most VAE conversation models match the approximate posterior distribution over the latent variables to a simple prior such as standard normal distribution, thereby restricting the generated responses to a relatively simple \(e.g., single\-modal\) scope. In this paper, we propose DialogWAE, a conditional Wasserstein autoencoder \(WAE\) specially designed for dialogue modeling. Unlike VAEs that impose a simple distribution over the latent variables, DialogWAE models the distribution of data by training a GAN within the latent variable space. Specifically, our model samples from the prior and posterior distributions over the latent variables by transforming context\-dependent random noise using neural networks and minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions. We further develop a Gaussian mixture prior network to enrich the latent space. Experiments on two widely\-used datasets show that DialogWAE outperforms the state\-of\-the\-art approaches in generating more coherent, informative and diverse responses. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Has anyone gone through a similar path? Part of me feels like getting more industry experience could be good, but part of me is very attracted to the independence and freedom consulting could give.

Specifically, this post is about an idea I had for weakly-supervised image segmentation, which uses conditional thresholds derived from attention maps to segment out the object of interest. While there are some obvious flaws with the idea (can't segment out multiple objects, though I have an idea on how to fix that), since I don't have any intentions to publish it, I thought it'd be cool to write about it!

The goal of this thread is twofold, to share what I have found about FGVC state of the art and to take note of anyone who could correct me.

The challenge consists on classifying entities which differ in some small subtle local features contained in a big context (noisy for this classification task). There are some typical datasets for this task such as [CUB birds](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html) or [Stanford dogs](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b5e3/beb791cc17cdaf131d5cca6ceb796226d832.pdf)

As far as I know, we could group the approaches for it between attention-driven and non-attention-driven.

For attention driven it could be interesting to read Fu et Al publications [RA-CNN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Fu_Look_Closer_to_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) and [MA-CNN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Zheng_Learning_Multi-Attention_Convolutional_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf) (state of the art for attention-driven approaches, which basically learns features and groups them into multiple parts for further weighting and final classification). Kanth et Al propose a [more generic method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05389.pdf) which works for non-fine-grained image classification as well as for fine-grained (slightly lower result), while Cui proposes [an improvement](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FGVC_CVPR_2018.pdf). Finally, PAIRS is exposed as the non-attention-driven state of the art [approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09057.pdf).

1. Naively run a simple clustering algorithm on these incoming vectors which could be 100 dimensional large (I believe naive clustering should start be ineffective at this point because of the large dimensionality)

2. Parameterise these functions by a GP, then run some kind of distance measuring metric (like a KL divergence) defined over these function spaces and cluster based on these KL divergence numbers.

I am given a weighted graph and want to find a set of edges such that every node is only incident to one edge and such that the sum of the selected edge weights is maximized. As far as I know this problem is generally referred to as maximum weight matching and there exist fast approximations for it: [https://web.eecs.umich.edu/\~pettie/papers/ApproxMWM\-JACM.pdf](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/papers/ApproxMWM-JACM.pdf)

However, for my application it would be better if only a certain ratio of nodes is paired. It's more important for my application that the nodes that get paired have a high weight between them. Leaving some nodes unpaired is no big problem.

Currently, I sort the weights between nodes in descending order and always select the edge with the highest weight until I have paired a certain number of nodes. Of course I ensure that pairs of nodes are mutually exclusive. This is only a 1/2 approximation to the original problem and it's probably even worse for the modified problem.

I'm currently trying to figure out under which constraints voice style transfer similar to this project is currently feasible in real time: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7a0wcv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7a0wcv/)

If there is a good chance of success my project would be to develop a speech enhancement device \(SED\) for my brother, one of who's vocal cords has recently become paralyzed for some unknown reason. He is still able to talk, but of course it is more quiet, sounds coarse and takes more effort. Whenever he wants to shout at someone, he just has a friend shout it for him :D , so the need for a SED is not an absolute necessity but more like a ""nice to have"" kind of thing. I happen to have about 30 min of high quality audio recordings of him with his healthy voice, from when he made a small audio book for his girlfriend, that could be used as training data for the speech synthesis part. The spoken language is German. I have a couple of questions and assumptions, that I'd love to get feedback on by some of the more experienced people here:

* For the speech recognition part: Software that takes speech and extracts phonemes from it or other features such as vocoder parameters or Mel Cepstral Coefficients already exists, and hopefully would not need to be trained on every single new speaker?
* For the synthesis / enhancement part: It seems that only just very recently it becomes possible to make high quality speech synthesis run in real time on personal computers, let alone on mobile devices. Deep Voice looks interesting, since it claims to offer a tunable trade\-off between synthesis speed and audio quality. Also 30 min of training data seems to be at the bottom end of what is needed for creating a quality neural speech synthesizer?

When thinking about the implications of having a realtime voice style transfer device, I quickly realized that they'd be quite huge. Not only could it be used for deep fakes / identity theft kind of scenarios, but also for a great amount of useful applications such as audio restoration and eliminating even the worst kind of noises by basically re\-synthesizing the speech from scratch, while maintaining it's original melody and rhythm. Let me know what you think about that side of things as well!

We're the authors of Spell, a tool for easily running ML/DL jobs remotely. As Deep Learning has grown we see engineers and researchers struggle to incorporate running on GPUs into their workflow. So we built Spell to be the easiest way to get code running elsewhere - like the bash '&amp;' operator but for remote machines. 

We'd love for you to try it out and give us your feedback! [Sign up](https://web.spell.run/waitlist) for an account and, for a limited time, get $300 in credits for GPU time. There's a waitlist, but we'll be approving accounts quickly

 Here are some of the features we really wanted and built into Spell:

* We don't want you to have to modify your code for it to run remotely. Particularly so it's easy to clone something off github and run it with one command

* Waiting for data to upload/move is one of the biggest time costs. So we built a single remote filesystem so you only need to upload data once. It's also a simple interface that everyone already understands
* Tools should be highly efficient and reliable. Machine learning needs more tools that are sturdy enough to use everyday and build whole pipelines around. So we spent a lot of time making sure our infrastructure is solid

There's plenty of [documentation](https://www.spell.run/docs), including a 30 second [quick start](https://www.spell.run/docs/quickstart/) and [guides](https://www.spell.run/docs/guides/) for running some common models. We also wrote a series of [medium posts](https://medium.com/@spellrun) where we reproduce as much of the work presented at ICLR as possible with a few commands.

As an another alternative, I thought of using an attention based scanning with deep reinforcement learning and recurrent layers, which can give image recognition a human like vision. Later however, I found out that this idea has already been proposed by [V. Mnih](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247) in 2014. Although a bit disappointed, I was thrilled to see the progress that have been made in this direction since then and how RL approaches are progressively making their way into mainstream machine learning tasks. The attention based scanning has been found suitable for fine\-grained visual classification tasks with [RA\-CNN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Fu_Look_Closer_to_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf), [online tracking](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Supancic_Tracking_as_Online_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf), and also finding applications in tasks where parameters are non\-differentiable and therefore cannot be learned directly via back\-propagation, such as in [ReasoNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05284): Learning to Stop Reading.

I will explain.

Mostly, the Authors are referring to learning the model parameters as estimating the true data generating probability distribution like in chapter 5.5, 5.7, 5.10 and others. For example in 5.10,  p_model(y|x) is used to represent that models learned probability distribution in the cost function, under the assumption of normal distribution of p_model. Like in 5.5.1 Example in the derivation from ML to MSE, they make the assumption of normal distribution and derive their result by just saying that the predicted value y of the model is simply the mean. In a specific case, it is surely reasonable but not as a general argument.

In fact, what all those models are doing is transforming input values to output values, they are functions, mappings from input values to output values, not input values to functions. The models themselves are the functions. The models are not probability distributions, because they are not producing probabilities by default. And here we come to chapter 6.2.2 to different Output Units, where the Authors kind of 'undermine' what I said. I try to reformulate what I mean more mathematical explicit and general applicable than in the mentioned chapter.

There are different Output Units and functions, which allow us to transform the output values of our models and make them behave like probabilities. Those transformations make sure, that the produced values correspond to the axioms of probability theory. They are not probabilities in a semantic way, they just behave like those, just another transformation to another kind of values we want to work with (a topological perspective on that transformation is much more intuitive).

We can simulate a discrete probability distribution by having multiple sigmoid neurons for each value, which we then normalize and say, that those values are probabilities of the appearing of that discrete value.

For continuous values, we just don't predict a distribution, we always predicting a value.

The Authors are making this thing easy from the start of the book, by using the predicted value and put it into a normal distribution, and saying, that the model is actually learning to try estimating a probability distribution - what is not the case in general. That is the classical thinking of classic old school statisticians, especially all that normal distribution assumption approach. But this is not what actually happens when a machine or deep learning model has learned its parameters, it's much easier than this. 

That's why I think, that starting with that assumption as default and then describing and deriving cost functions etc. is a misconception and in some cases a wrong formulation of what is actually happening, also bad in terms of intuition.

I was interested in writing this post not to declare that the authors are wrong. I think and hope, that there might be other perspectives, maybe a meta-perspective or mental model of what a model is actually doing that is better than mine so I can correct, maybe I am missing something, would like to enrich my position on this with other competent views.

I want to build a scene classification model to recognize images from the Places356 dataset. There has been so much activity regarding face and object classification models, but very little regarding scene classification. MIT released this model, pretrained on Places365, for education purposes: [https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365](https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365). However, the model is not very accurate \(top 1 accuracy is about 50&amp;#37;\).

I've seen people having great results with NasNet for image classification in general, so I thought about taking a NasNet CNN trained on ImageNet and retraining it on Places365 to make it work for scene classification.

I've been thinking for some time on the AIs we see in movies, specifically JARVIS and FRIDAY from the MCU, and they always seem to be able to synthesize their own speech, something real\-life chat bots cant do.

From the limited research I did, many chat bots these days are CNN trained on a static set of conversation. Therefore, the more conversation there are in a data set, the more capable that chat bot is, and that's how many people operate. An example of this would be Chatterbot on GitHub: [https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot). However, this still limits the CNN to operating within the training set and whatever the CNN's generalization comes up with. Many of these chatbots fail when people attempt to have more elaborate conversations with them. 

Now look at their sci\-fi counterparts. They can not only converse/take orders from humans, like real life chatbots, but also synthesize their own speech and thoughts. The most prominent example I can find is the conversation JARVIS and Ultron had when Ultron was just created, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO8SpOT3Thc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO8SpOT3Thc). I just find it improbable that JARVIS's conversation was purely a result of generalization over a static training set. 

If this all seems silly, I do apologize but I am relatively new to machine learning and I am interested in trying my hands at creating a real\-life JARVIS that is more human than previous attempts. Any pointers to research, code on GitHub, or just advice/suggestion in general about anything that is related to this would be greatly appreciated.

during my learning of ML, I was introduced by my non-CS teacher to IBMs SPSS Tool, which includes several modelling possibilities, including some ML Models like Neural Networks or K-Means clustering or more. The tool provides a possibility of creating e.g. a NN with a simple drag-and-drop, and visualizing and assessing it quite easily. I was impressed by its interface, although I could see some limitations in the complexity of the Models used.
On the other hand, the company I work for (old-school automotive OEM in Germany) is struggling to build a platform to provide a ML environment (Hadoop, TensorFlow) where our newly hired data analysts can do their magic. However, in my humble opinion, I would say that IBM SPSS would suffice for almost all of the current use-cases we could have. 
And in here, Im able to follow some of the research that is spearheading this field. The focus of research is always to breakthrough, but currently even basic ML is not used by our company.

My question to you guys and for discussion is: 
-	Generally speaking, I feel like that the industry (not software or e-commerce companies, real industrial companies) could really benefit by simply using off-the-shelf tools like SPSS, instead of trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer and implement state-of-the-art algorithms and models. What do you think about it? What is your experience between the gap of the industry and the research?


I might be too nave regarding SPSS, or even too pessimist about the usage of ML in the industry. Im learning and working only a few months on this topic and am open for new opinions.

as the title implies, I'm searching the best shape for an aeroracing car(Formula 1 in schools), and I thought ""why shouldn't I give a machine a try?"". 
The only three problems are:
1. I'm a total noob at programming machine learning. 
Where can I get good literature to support my development of this project (if it would even be viable)(i've taken a look at the sidebar)
2. Is it possible to make an algorithm use my CAD and CFD software Autodesk Fusion 360 and CFD 2019? 
The bigger problem is CAD, since it has to randomly modify only parts of the car that are legal to modify, the CFD part could be hardcoded.
3. Where do I get the computation power, memory and storage for such a huge project (for free/cheap)? The CFD simulation alone takes 4GB of memory per run and about 30-40 minutes on my PC. If I wanted do do 500 iterations, it would take a week or longer. I've heard that you can acess quantum computers via internet with 12-15 QBits, could this be a soloution? Would it (technically) be possible to take the computers of my school and distribute the task to a lot of PCs?

I'm not quite sure if it even was legal to use the file generated by the algorithm in the competition, but it would be interesting for sure how it would turn out.",5,5,False,self,,,,,

I was wondering what would cause an Actor / Critic RL method (DDPG in my case) to diverge after finding a solution. I am noticing that my implementation (which is exactly as described in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)) finds a solution on a dummy problem that would be considered ""solved"", but then begins to unlearn this and totally diverges. Thoughts on why this may happen would be helpful.

I have a question and could use some hints on the best way to proceed for my problem.
What I have is the following:
- a set of ""projects"" (each project is a training example). You may look at them as ""designs"" or ""products"". For each of these ""projects"", I have a series of ""components"" or ""parts"". The list of ""components"" is variable and can go all the way from 5 to 40. These ""components"" are currently grouped or matched by a human expert into ""categories"" or ""clusters"" which are not exclusive (a component may belong to several categories and a category usually contains several components). See below for example.

    Project Z

*                       | Cat A | Cat B | Cat C | Cat D |

*    component 1 |   [x]   |   [-]  |   [x]   |   [-]   |

*    component 2 |   [x]   |   [x]  |   [x]   |   [-]   |

*    component 3 |   [-]   |   [-]   |   [x]   |   [x]  |

*    component 5 |   [x]   |   [x]  |   [x]   |   [-]   |

*    component 6 |   [-]   |   [-]   |   [-]   |   [x]   |

I have:
- K projets (training dataset)

For each project:
- M components grouped into N soft clusters

My goal is to take a list of component (variable size) and generate the mapping shown above (variable size matrix where number of row equals the number of input components) and number of column needs to be found (varies between projects). Cat A, B, C have no specific meaning (cat A in project XX is unrelated to Cat A in project ZZ - just need to find the right groups of components)

I thought about splitting the problem in 2 steps (1st number of categories then assign components to categories). Issue is that each of these ""clusters"" are on a project basis and not for my whole dataset (not N categories for the whole dataset but rather K * N clusters with the goal being identifying the N cluster for a new unseen set of components)

Any ideas? Many thanks!

I was thinking of using NEAT on a separate machine to train a neural network to respond to these given inputs (the input sensors, wheel encoders, and bluetooth waypoint) and then porting the trained neural network to the Pi, but as I am sorely lacking in knowledge regarding machine learning, I have no idea whether this is an appropriate approach and would hugely appreciate advice on where to start. 

I probably didn't explain the project in detail enough for a detailed answer, so please ask if further specification is required for any useful advice to be given.

tldr: I want to build a self driving RC car that can get from Point A to Point B. Any advice on where to start on the software would be greatly appreciated.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I.e., imagine the common image\-autoencoder scenario where the pixels are normalized to range \[0, 1\]. In practice, one would commonly minimize either the pixel\-wise binary cross\-entropy between the predicted pixels and the original pixels or the pixel\-wise MSE. Pixel\-wise MSE makes sense because it's symmetric. However, for the BCE, we have different ""loss"" values depending on the magnitude of the prediction and the true labels. E.g., consider the following

| predicted value | true pixel value | BCE loss |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| 0.0             | 0.0              | 0.0      |
| 0.25            | 0.25             | 0.56     |
| 0.5             | 0.5              | 0.69     |
| 0.75            | 0.75             | 0.56     |
| 1.0             | 1.0              | 0.0      |

Note that with non-symmetric, I mean that even though the prediction matches the true pixel value, the loss can vary between 0.0 and 0.7, while the MSE would be (more intuitively) always zero in these cases.

Based on my experience, I find that BCE often works well for autoencoders, often the results look better than results obtained with MSE.

Any ideas what the reason could be for that?

My intuition would be that we don't perceive difference in very dark or very bright pixels that much, and human-perception-wise.",9,6,False,self,,,,,

This is the topic of my thesis. And I have conducted a great number of experiment including traditional image processing and machine learning, pre-trained deep networks, 2D CNN, 3D CNN, tried data augmentation, blending data modalities to enrich the data and etc, but none of these experiments yielded any significant results, primarily because of the scarcity of data and this being a multi-class classification problem. I have put in a lot of efforts into this but the results aren't very impressive, however, I am aiming to publish a paper in the following conference: http://www.tut.fi/euvip2018/index.html but I am not confident what could be an interesting approach to talk explain in the paper. A few titles that came to my mind were:
* Inefficacy of deeper networks on smaller datasets. (No dense layers with dense layers)
* Traditional machine learning methods performing as well as deep learning.
* Effects of data augmentation on learning of deep models.

This is my first post on here, so please forgive me if i have the improper tag.. it would either be D or R

I am very keen to learn more about deep learning so that I could apply it towards the editing of videos.

i have been self-learning Python online in my free time, by trying to read ""automate the boring stuff"" and trying to following Youtube tutorials on fundamentals. I understand and follow along with the concept and big picture stuff. But by the end of the project, I feel I was just taken for the ride. I want to have projects of my own to show for it. 

If possible, i really want to work on something that is bigger than myself and be able to contribute my knowledge about video editing theory, even if its not on the programming side since im from film . I could test or something. It would be so good to have a mentor to guide me. I don't have a formal CS background, but I do have a background in film production

I think Id like to learn about computer vision, automation, and streamlining with Python so that I can be creating or helping to create an application or script for content creators or for things that VFX artists might use that are in moviemaking. 

I'd really love to speak to someone in that industry, or if I could get very specific directions on a roadmap to get me up to speed. I need to take to become competent at making as I have been kind of overwhelmed with all of the information on the internet. Thank you for your time!

The situation: Suppose I have location data (for example the whereabouts of all the items in my house).  I want to do some learning on this data to understand where items are generally kept and therefore when items are out of place.  For example, if I misplace the remote I might get a notification when the remote has strayed too far from its general location.  I guess there would also be some clustering involved, e.g. items in the ""kitchen area"" would be categorised under ""kitchen utensils"" or ""food"", although not all items in the kitchen fit into these categories necessarily.  I also want a way of suggesting better storage locations for items that are frequently used far away from where they're kept (e.g. if I keep the torch in the downstairs cupboard but only ever use it in the top attic, why not move it closer to the attic?).

But this seems to be an ill\-posed problem; depth cannot be measured using a single image! If the domain is pre\-defined, then depth estimation is possible and quite accurate (for example, [this project](http://cvl-demos.cs.nott.ac.uk/vrn/) allows 3D reconstruction of a face, since it is trained on facial image and model data). But for measuring the length of any arbitrary line in 3D space, a single image should not suffice!

I noticed that, generally, when we maximize the likelihood function (in the frequentist interpretation), we find the argmax of the data, given the parameters, to find the actual parameters of the distribution function for the data. However, the parameters found may not necessarily be the actual parameters. 

For example, given the data sample, a certain set of parameters may maximize your likelihood function, but this sample may be too small, so the parameters found may have deviated considerably from the actual parameters

Or a random set of parameters maximizes the likelihood function because it fits the noise really well but the region around this set of parameters has a very low likelihood, but there be another region of parameters which may have a much higher likelihood. In this case, the actual parameters may be in the other region. 

Are there any confidence estimates for the parameters (maybe that uses bootstrapping or something, Im not too sure)? Like confidence estimates for all parameters found in the model. Like for the above example, if we considered the region in which actual parameters reside, it may be more likely that the actual parameters reside in the second region rather than the first, if we considered the mean of the likelihood function of those regions. Is there analysis that considers confidence estimates for specific parameters that takes everything into account? I know for linear regression you may have p-values associated with coefficients which would suggest that certain coefficients may be more or less likely to be relevant to the regression. Also, I believe there are confidence intervals for the coefficients. Is this applicable to other ML models (both convex and non-convex)? For linear regression, I believe this may attribute a bayesian interpretation to the parameters because now you assume the coefficients are normally distributed, I believe, though Im not really sure.

Similarly, for the bayesian interpretation, we try to maximize the posterior probability of the parameters given the evidence. Similarly, we may find a set of parameters that is most likely, but another set of parameters are the actual parameters or another region is more likely to have the actual parameters. Are there any confidence estimates for the parameters? it seems in this case, we could clearly measure the probability of different regions much easier at least considering we consider the parameters as random variables (also, because the parameters are continuous, the actual probability for a specific set of parameters for the posterior distribution should be zero, right?), and thus we could create estimates and have a degree of confidence in our estimates of the parameters and thus proceed much more smoothly potentially. I dont know if analysis along these lines is used in practice.

&gt; egrefen commented:
I found this article a little meh. It's clear that the VAE won't do anything in both of the datasets provided since you don't need the latent variable. Any trivial model will be able to perfectly estimate p(x) from the data, without needing a latent factor. It has nothing to do with the choice of prior or proposal distribution, and everything to do with the problem at hand not requiring additional expressivity.

&gt; The post is mistakenly set up to be about VAEs, but misses the point that latent variable models are not needed for the datasets provided full stop, regardless of the inference mechanism.

Can anyone explain this comment? I do not see it but really want to understand.

It seems to me (maybe wrong) that in the VAE two extreme cases or possible, or anything
in between them. 

1. The probability of *all* the data, p(x), is learned (or approximately learned), and the latent is not used.
That is what happened in the blog post. Taking account the autoencoder-like strucure,
it learned ""p(x=1|x=1)=0.5,  p(x=0|x=1) = 0.5"" which is a failure.

2. The network learns to predict the value of *each* data point individually, and the latent is required to do this.
If it is also able to shrink the variance, then the likelihood can be made very high, and exceed case #1.  I believe this is the expected and desired behaviour.
We want p(x=1|x=1) = 1.

Improving the likelihood/minimizing the NLL is a cost which favours case #2. However my interpretation was that in the particular example, the KL term completely outweigh this, for reasons I do not understand.",11,4,False,self,,,,,

Whether it's the iPhone, Virtual Assistances, and even cars that drive themselves. But with all this technology that has been created and given to the public, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have an iPad or MacBook. It's impossible to find someone who doesn't have a Smartphone like iPhone, Android, etc.

But with everything that has been created, one of the most innovating World Changing inventions has to be Artificial intelligence. Whether it's Alexa, Cortana, Siri or one of the other Virtual Assistants, inventions like those has been World Changing. It doesn't even have to be a Virtual Assistant. Countless Websites, Companies, Apps and places like those has Artificial intelligence carry a lot of the work load also.

With everything that has been created and improved upon with Artificial intelligence, how close are we to living in a World like that Will Smith movie, I, Robot,"" or even something like, ""*2001: A Space Odyssey."" ??*

Are we getting closer to living in a World like those where AI has become too smart and decides to ensalve us all? Or are we still MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS away from something like that even remotely happening? Should I have my bags packed and start building a bunker to be prepared because we're close and it could happen at any moment? 

\*\*Lastly...\*\*\*

Whether we're close or not, just so I can be prepared for it happen, if it does happen. What would your guys, ""go\-to sign,"" for when it finally happens?  What should I look for as a sign of it's happening? Like a specific event or moment to where when it happen, that's my signal to let me know shit's about to go down. Lol",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently working on a project for my master's studies on mitosis detection for which I got data from a hospital. Since I'm not very experienced in computer vision tasks (yet), I'd like to get some feedback from experienced people on how to tackle my problem. For those who are unfamiliar with mitosis detection - mitosis detection basically comprises the counting of dividing nuclei on hematoxylin &amp; eosin whole slide images (note: that's my very newbie definition as a non-medical practitioner. Sorry, if this is not exactly on point ;-) ). If you are familiar with the recent Data Science Bowl challenge on Kaggle, that's basically an extension of the task. You can find a very good explanation of the background from this link: http://tupac.tue-image.nl/node/2

**Objective**
So the objective of my project is, as I've already hinted, to detect mitoses on images that I got from a hospital.  There is already done work on mitosis detection in literature, however most of them don't cope with the problems and constraints I have in my project. Thus, I might just get some rough ideas but I'm not sure how to connect them in order to apply them on my problem setting.

**Dataset(s)**
Here's the thing: The dataset I got from the hospital is not 'ready-to-go' annotated. The only information I have is somewhat an arrow-annotation that indicates that near the head of the arrow is a mitosis. So the two options I have (and that I can come up with) are: 

- Annotating them further which is very time-consuming (depending on the annotation to do) and then train directly on this data
- Train on publicly available datasets and hope that the model generalizes well on the hospital data.

I did some screenshots of image crops and the annotations of the hospital data in following link, so that you can get a rough impression of the data: https://imgur.com/a/1YvRn8k

You can already notice that there's a lot of morphological-invariance of the mitosis (i.e. the shape of the mitosis) and also stain-invariance (i.e. the intensity of colours) between the slides. 

As for publicly available dataset, I have found the following:

- ICPR'12 Mitosis Detection Challenge: http://ludo17.free.fr/mitos_2012/download.html
  This dataset has the mitoses segmented, i.e. the vertices of a polygon are provided. Also it is relatively small (both in terms of slides and mitotic figures). Important to note: The stain and morphological invariance is not that distinct
- ICPR'14 Mitosis Detection Challenge: https://mitos-atypia-14.grand-challenge.org/home/
  This dataset has only the centroid of the mitosis annotated. There's also information on non-mitotic figures that could be detected as mitosis. The dataset is also larger then the ICPR'12. However, the variance is low.
- TUPAC Mitosis Detection Challenge: http://tupac.tue-image.nl/node/3
  This dataset has also only the centroid of the mitosis annotated. However, this dataset is much richer of 
  slide and mitosis variance and is also relatively large. 

Many papers that I've found work only with the first two datasets, however, as I've said, I don't think these datasets capture enough variance so that their work would be applicable on my dataset.

**Approaches/Ideas**

Due to the somewhat hard-constraints I have regarding the datasets, I was gathering about approaches and ideas how to tackle this problem. This includes on how to model this problem, i.e. do a segmentation or an object detection or maybe even only a classification. Since I only need to count the mitosis in an image, a simple integer as output could be sufficient but I think it would also be nice to locate them in any way. But I'm not sure which modelling approach would be feasible regarding the annotation of the datasets I have.

There's one approach that I've tried out so far (and failed miserably):

I made this problem a segmentation problem. For this, I used the out-of-the-box Mask-RCNN from matterport (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) which was quite often used in the Data Science Bowl challenge and also has a sample of application in the DSB in the git. So my idea was to train a model on Mask-RCNN on the DSB data, since I thought the general appearance of the DSB data is a little similar to the mitosis data. Then used this model to do a transfer learning on the ICPR'12 dataset. But when applying the learned model on the ICPR'12 dataset it failed miserably on the hospital dataset as I get many false positives, especially in the cases where the colours are more intense like the one in the second screenshot.

A very simple, but naive and slow (and old) approach would be the one by Ciresan et al. [1]. They basically did a classification by training on positive and negative patches so that the model would predict whether there is a mitosis in the center of the patch or not. That implies that I would need to center every pixel of the slides (which are btw. roughly 4500x4500 for the hospital dataset) and run it through the network. However, I think it would be a good starter baseline as the approach is simple and there not much too much magic behind it that you need to tweak whatsoever. 

Nevertheless, I'm tempted to try some newer approaches that are available for object detection and instance/semantic segmentation. I believe, if the problem is modelled correctly, they would give better results. The obvious architectures are of course something like Faster-RCNN, Mask-RCNN, any kind of U-Net. However, I'm not sure how to make use of the datasets for this, especially the ones that only have the centroids. Is it for Mask-RCNN or U-Net sufficient to provide the centroid of an object as a label? Then I could throw everything together and see what's happening. Overall, I'm also not sure if a 1-class annotation is good in general or if I should provide more classes as annotation, for example another class for nuclei which of course appear in a huge number in the slides. 

And of course there are other tweaks that I thought about incorporating and that would maybe help the problem, for example Focal Loss, a sort of data augmentation like in [2] etc.


As for evaluation, the official metrics of the ICPR'12/ICPR'14 is appropriate in my opinion. They calculate F1-Score on the basis of the distance between the centroid of the prediction and the centroid if the ground truth. So if it's the predicted centroid is in range of x pixels from the ground truth centroid then it's a true positive otherwise false positive/negative. This is a flexible metric and can be applied to any annotation. But I'm of course open for any other suggestions.

So bottom-line: 

Sorry for the wall of text but I don't think I could have done a tl;dr version of my problem. As I said, I'm still unsure how to tackle this problem and besides trying out the Mask-RCNN approach, I'm also at the very beginning. I believe the most important question right now is: Can I work with the publicly available data or do I need to get more data? The latter would of course imply that I have to annotate my dataset further which costs a lot of time. I realize that this question cannot be answered beforehand and needs to be somewhat experimentally evaluated. If I was going to use only the public datasets which approach would you design? Is there a way you can think of to make it a segmentation task or at least an object detection task? 

I would be really glad to head some feedback from you guys. Thanks a lot for your time!

While the original intent was to get the most interested reviewers for submissions, as always the reality is somewhat different. This has apparently led to people bidding for each others papers (finding authors via arxiv) or authors themselves exchanging paper IDs, resulting essentially a ""i'll scratch your back you scratch mine"". This will guarantee at least a single if not more positive review(s) in the process, which is a huge benefit over others who are not partaking in this process. Is this true? How widely is the system abused in your experience?

610,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2018-6-12,2018,6,12,1,8qaqa1,self.MachineLearning,[D] How would projected natural gradient work with differentiable plasticity?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8qaqa1/d_how_would_projected_natural_gradient_work_with/,abstractcontrol,1528733184,"Trying to work out the [BPRONG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07147) updates is no problem as long as they are on the linear regime. I can extend the equations readily for vanilla recurrent nets and probably could for convolutional nets. Likewise for nets with skip connections.

Here a short explanation of the problem. 

    R (W U (z - c) + b) = R' (W' U' (z - c') + b'), for all z

`R` and `U`  are whitening matrices and `W` is the standard feedforward multiply. `z` is the input and `c` is the estimated mean of `z`. `W` and `b` are updated using SGD, and `R`,`U` and `c` are updated in an unsupervised fashion much like batch norm. After that last step, `W` and `b` need to be reprojected to `W'` and `b'` so that the function itself does not change. That is accomplished if the above equation is satisfied.

That can be done by setting `W' = R'^-1 R W U U'^-1` and `b' = R'^-1 (R W U c' - R W U c + R b)`. This is similar to how it is done in the paper, I've merely merged the forward and the backward updates. The method in the paper is not iterative and could be made a lot faster by updating the whitening matrix iteratively and doing the above updates without resorting to matrix inversion. The first could be done by taking the scheme for the update of the whitening matrix from the [EASS paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Equivariant-adaptive-source-separation-Cardoso-Laheld/ca9fc6bb80d7fd89055f46d716aa8b6e2e377a5e) and the second using SGD or maybe some other convex optimization method.

How could the method be adapted to work when the update is something like from the [differentiable plasticity paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464):

    x j (t) = o(sum (fun i -&gt; w i j * x i (t-1) + a i j * Hebb i j (t) x i (t - 1)))
    Hebb i j (t+1) = n * x i (t - 1) * x j (t) + (1 - n) * Hebb i j (t)

The issue is how to make sure that the function does not change after updating the whitening matrices and the centering vectors. When the linear matrix multiply is replaced by a nonlinear function that is no longer obvious.

    R (f (W, U (z - c)) + b) = R' (f (W', U' (z - c')) + b') for all z

The above can no longer be solved by setting `W' = R'^-1 R W U U'^-1`. Can anything be done here to solve this?

It might be plausible that BPRONG could work without reprojecting the weights after the unsupervised updates if they are smooth enough which could be the case if they are done iteratively, but that does not feel right though.",8,4,False,self,,,,,

Most variables were answers from a customer questionnaire (to prevent fraud). These were answers such as 'agree, strongly agree, disagree, neutral, ...', so they had inherent ordering. The guy ( who is no longer a collegue, cant ask him about it) noted in a short accompanying powerpoint that using simple integer substitution wouldn't be correct for most of these cases, since the truth is more nuanced than that.

I however have never encountered RIDIT in my textbooks, and the topic of ordinal categorical variables as features is indeed something that I don't see widely discussed. Most texts go as far as 'categorical variables go into one\-hot encoding' or something like that.

So my question is, can anybody point to some insights on this technology, some case study or cool textbook? Or has it been 'replaced' with some modern variant of PCA?

A toy example would be weather measurements over a series of days and the M_i are temperature readings at random unknown times during the day. 

I was hoping to compress the M_i by first passing them through a feedforward network and then taking the average of the final layer for each timestep, and feed the resulting vectors as a sequence into an RNN. The output of the RNN would be a prediction based on the sequence.

Conceptually this all seems fine to me, in terms of being able to propagate the error back through the RNN and the FF/averaging network, though I'm not sure if any of the prominent packages support a variable length sequence within a variable length sequence, or if they do, how one would go about it.

Hello everyone I have two awesome announcements today: 

\- First, I'm really excited to announce that **we published our first video version of the course on youtube** , videos will focus on the implementation part with Tensorflow** with new environment**s (OpenAI Taxi\-v2 , Space Invaders , Outrun  ...). One published per week  every Tuesday.

This first video focus on the implementation of Q\-learning agent that learns to play OpenAI Taxi\-v2  where she must **learn to take a passenger at a location and drop him off at another as fast as possible.**

\&gt;\&gt; This is our first video **so any feedback and advice is welcomed**** **!

**Q\-learning with Numpy and OpenAI Taxi**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ZOEFAaaI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ZOEFAaaI0)

\- Second our website has been improved, with the new calendar . I apologize for the delay in publishing the articles, **don't worry the course is back on track !**

Next week will be published :

 *Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)* article and implementation with tensorflow

 *Improvements in Deep Q Learning* (Dueling, Prioritized experiences ...) article and implementation with tensorflow

Again let me say what you think about the course (articles and videos) and **how it should be improved!**

Thanks for your help!

Have a great day!",2,45,False,self,,,,,

But I don't know what I can implement with my current knowledge, and I need a list of assignments related to the topics, for example a Stanford course's assignments or sth like that.

https://i.redd.it/ex5hj0oycj011.png What is Nurture.ai?

It is an online platform created by AI learners like you. We were frustrated with our difficulties in efficiently keep up with the fast pace of AI research. We also wanted to push for more reproducibility and facilitate better understanding in AI papers. Therefore, we built the free Nurtue.ai platform to encourage online collaboration and exchange among an AI community. Nurture.ai is also the organiser of the NIPS 2017 challenge and AI Saturdays. To date, we have a strong community of over 2500 users ranging from PhD students, industry practitioners and self-learners. We believe in the value of helping learners worldwide to get more out of AI research. We hope you feel the same way too. You can:

Share your learning notes on Nurture.ai. Simply highlight any text in an arXiv preprint to annotate and start a discussion thread.

Contribute to community reviews on your favourite papers

Post and discuss code implementations Follow us on facebook and twitter. Note! We are NOT nature.ai. Yeah, it's the nurture versus nature question, ain't it?My team and I are working hard to optimise user experience on the platform, let us know how we can make your learning more enjoyable on Nurture.ai.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

However, consider the situation where a child sees a dog for the first time and while seeing it its mother says ""This is a dog."" The child is thus able to link the utterance ""dog"" and the appeareance of the dog he sees right now.

I am wondering about the requirements of a machine learning system that could deal with such a supervision signal. Probably lots of skills like language understanding and even reasoning is nessecary to link this information together. For the sake of simplicity imagine that the problem is somewhat easier and our system loosely consists of 3 components: audio classifier, image classifier and a mechanism that decides whether to use the output of a classifier as target for another classifier. Also let's assume that the components are based on neural networks.

In the ""dog"" scenario the following would happen: In the image classifier a new category ""dog"" is created: In the context of neural networks envision that a new output neuron x is added to our image classifier. Neuron x is magically trained to react to the visual appearance of the dog the child sees right now. Also in the audio classifier a new category belonging to the utterance ""dog"" is created, so we have another neuron y that reacts to utterance ""dog"" strongly. But even more importantly we also have to save that the utterance ""dog"" and the appearance of the dog is linked together, so there has to be saved somehow that x and y belong together. Now imagine that a couple of days later the child sees another dog but is not quite sure if this is also a dog. Luckily his mother is with him and tells him again ""This is a dog"". The audio classifier recognizes with high confidence the utterance ""dog"" so neuron y gets activated. Because neuron y is linked to neuron x, which is part of the image classifier, a mechanism decides that the new dog that the boy sees right now can be used to update the ""dog"" visual category. So the target for the image classifier is provided by the audio classifier.

This is only one very specific example of uncountable scenarios where it is neseecary that supervision is provided by ""the system itself"". A scenario like I described here is probably completely out of reach, but I am generally interested in examples where people used the output of one system as a target for another system. For example WaveNet uses a perceptual loss: As far as I understand when they generate audio they use another speech\-to\-text network to check whether the recognized phrase matches the phrase that is tried to be generated. Also GANs use a special source of supervision that is provided by another neural network, the discriminator.

I am sure a lot of people already thought about this and I wonder if you guys could point me to some related work. Also what are the most creative sources of supervision you ever came across?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I know it's not right place to ask this kind of questions but i think there are guys who can answer that question.

Machine learning translations provides high quality translation results, but i think, it's possible to translate texts with statistical calculations as well.

I just wonder if there are any specific reasons to do translations with ML. I think one of them is about processing large files, instead of parsing and calculating everything from scratch. This is not good idea. But that can be solved with different ways as well.

Why ML has very important role on that kind of job?

Before asking that, i worked on my personal project to solve if it's possible to translate sentences without ML, with statistical computing. And i wrote PHP function to do that. It reads file and calculates probability of words and sequences and returns a result of these scores. It looks like that, it really works with English-Turkish and English-French pairs. Even with small dataset.

I am currently working on a project to forecast time\-series data. The data looks like this:

I have water usage in farms (on hourly basis for every part of the land). It's a very big farm, every big part contain some kind of plants. I divided the land to small squares. Furthermore I also have on top of that the weather data. Obviously, the hotter weather is, the more plants consume water. I have other information such wind, rain, type of plants on this square.. etc

In order to tackle the problem, I was thinking of treating every small square independently. Every square has 1 time\-series, with other related features that I can use. What would be a good way of preprocessing this? I want to train a LSTM that can predict the use of water. I was thinking of two choices:

1/ use multivariate time\-series data and somehow preprocess data to build multivariate LSTM

2/ process only timeseries and use the other features on the last layer (dense layer)

\*\*Question1\*\* What would be the best option, from the perspective of using LSTM the right way ?

The other thing I was thinking about is incorporating the inter\-related parts (the small cells). I assume that the cells that are near to each others have the same behaviour, so I started thinking of using CNN to capture the regional dependencies/similarities. 

\*\*Question2\*\* Does CNN\-LSTM make sense on this case ?

Thanks in advance for your time. ",17,27,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently working on a project where I am doing sequence-to-sequence prediction, and I'm evaluating several models of networks. For this particular instance, I'm evaluating the use of deep convolutional networks to predict a time series. My input series is a fixed-length sequence of vectors each with a length/""feature dimension"" of 16. 

I'm intending on using a 1-dimensional ""causal"" convolutional network, similar to that used in Google's famous WaveNet project. However, I'm still thinking about how to intelligently deal with the high dimensionality of my input. WaveNet, for instance, operates on simple single-value audio waveforms, whereas my input ""waveform"" has many independent channels.

Does anybody here have experience with this and Keras?

Thanks.",6,9,False,self,,,,,

This idea comes several times in the paper. On p.2, 

&gt; our goal is to tran an autoencoder as a generative model by keeping q(z)...close ot the prior),

earlier on p.2

&gt; set the prior to be p(z) = 1/k sum q(z_j|x_j)


I understand the ganeral goal, that q(z) should be close to the prior (and a problem iwth VAEs is that the KL term pulls q(z|x) rather than actually q(z)). The prior is used to ""shape"" the encoding.

My question: why is it a good goal to set the prior to be the approximate posterior?

I feel like in this case the prior has no role, it is just mimicing what would already happen if there was no regularization to a prior.

Basically pointing me to papers or just a good dialogue would be much appreciated. Im not in school so I dont have much access to others interested in the field.


Uncertainty and exploration: Ive been tinkering with cartpole and using an e-greedy exploration method. But, I dont like fixed or pre-determined exploration rates because theyre just not realistic. One way Ive approached this differently is to increase the likelihood of exploration when the net is uncertain about with action to take. Ive implemented this by looking at the certainty conveyed by the softmax output; higher certainty is conveyed by a larger distance between outputs. Note that certainty doesnt entail accuracy, merely a large about of consistent training for the current state. This does work but my experience is that it takes longer to converge. Open to suggestions.

Novelty nets: Along the lines of thought above it would be nice if upon entering a state the agent knew if it had been there before. Easy enough for the finite case right, but not so for continuous spaces. Itd be great if this would be accomplished with a neural net, but my understanding is that its impossible. You can only update a net with new info via backprop and one cant train on data unseen. Which leads to my next line of thought...

Unsupervised categorization: If youve followed my previous two points this will make more sense. Its a given that learning good categories enables good RL, but most robust categorization methods seem to involve supervised learning. I attribute this to the fact that nets can learn to engineer better distance metrics than the ones classically used in unsupervised learning. It strikes me that in a similar way that people abandoned hand-engineer features for learning them the future of unsupervised learning methods will involve learning the best distance metrics for the data set at hand. BUT, Im not really sure where to start on this. If I could integrate a good unsupervised method that just so happened to have a way to judge classification uncertainty then I could address the novelty and exploration points above in one blow. This leads to my last thought...

Long-term memory: Robust unsupervised learning like that mentioned above would also enable a very compact form of memory storage, and storage in a way that doesnt depend on unraveling RNNs through time. We certainly retain memories bizarrely well. I remember things from both my childhood and yesterday, likely using the same retrieval methods. As Sutton has pointed out, What function approximation cant do, however, is augment the state representation with memories of past observations. I just feel like we need a better way to address long-term memories and its access. For example I can see a new scene that triggers an old memory, which is a scenario that maybe could be well approximated by an LSTM, but could it follow the memory down so to speak; one access triggering a related memory and so on until that linkage chain is exhausted and the useful memories assimilated. I think an unsupervised learning method could very well enable this by use of its learned relation methods.

Thanks to anyone who stuck with me, all thoughts welcome.",26,6,False,self,,,,,

I am self taught when it comes to machine learning, so I wanted to come to the community to ask about the feasibility of my idea before possibly wasting my univeristy's and professor's time.  

I have a dataset of 60 people here watching 6 virtual reality videos, and their head positions in 3D frame-by-frame.  I then took each video, and produced a saliency map frame-by-frame to mark the ""most interesting"" parts of the video.

What I was wanting to do is use an LSTM, trained on *previous head positions* *and salient areas*, to be able to predict *where the user will look 2-3 seconds in advance*, given I have the saliency map of an arbritrary video as input.

Is this a feasibile problem?

Is an LSTM the first type of architecture I should be looking into if so?  I've done some research and some people **praise** LSTMs for their work on time sensitive information, but other people say time series specifically are not the best for LSTMs because they will look heavily on the previous time step for their prediction which can be a problem.

Just some additional information if anybody is curious as to why I want to produce this model:  If I know the user's head movement 2-3 seconds in advance, I can then use SVC video encoding to incrementally upgrade *certain* areas of the video, while keeping others at lower quality to meet bandwitdth requirements in the case that this VR video is being streamed over a network.

I want to find similar images of p in M.

All the images in M have different sizes, so the process is more complicated to fixed sizes.

I notice that google has this function. What is the mechanism and algorithm for that?

I searched on the web. In deep learning, a CNN is used first followed by LSTM and then dense layer.

However, there are some problems.

First, the image sizes are assumed to be fixed. It is suggested to crop the images before processing. In reality, some important information may be lost due to improper crop. How to deal with variable sizes?

Second, this is a classification problem using training set. In reality, training samples of some classes are much fewer than the others. It may affect the accuracy. How to compare pairwise images, that is, compare every images in M to p and find the most similar one in M instead of doing classification?

Any examples on similar image processing?

I'm currently doing my masters in Electronics and I want my thesis to be on a machine learning system. I've worked with multiple neural network architectures like MLP and RBF and have pretty good knowledge about CNNs, GANs and other machine/deep learning structures. I've been lurking for a long time.

I've done some research and projects about bioinformatics and optimization algorithms, maybe have a 1 or 2 paper coming up.

I need to decide on a project for my thesis, which is why I've opened this discussion.

I've some ideas revolving around GAN and music. Also, had my mind set on drones, balance and reinforcement learning for some time. But, I couldn't decide what to work on yet!

What are your opinions? I'm open to everything. Which methods, structures are hot currently?

More recently, I've been working on integrating AR into indoor environments, and my recent [Retail AR](https://twitter.com/AndrewProjDent/status/981635577488519170) demo went viral, even being featured [on Mashable](https://mashable.com/2018/04/05/artificial-reality-retail-shopping-tool/).

My skills are in R&amp;Ding solutions to the technical and user experience challenges involved with AR, and being able to create compelling experiences from that.

CV is a key part of AR, especially when it comes to integrating with real-world environments, such as when recognising products in a store. I've spent a while learning CV, but it's clear that it's not an area where I'm effective, and I feel my time is wasted there. It'd be better for me to partner with someone who does CV really well.

1. Two or more randomly weighted neural networks receive the same input.

2. If they disagree on the output, use backpropogation on the odd one[s] out until the output number is the same as the the other network[s]. 

The goal is to have many different models agree with each-other. The output numbers being the same means the models agree on what it is seeing.  The outputs ""mirror"" each-other.  

After many rounds of backprop, this generates thousands of ""numbers"" which do not behave as numbers, but rather symbols that represent models/experiences.  

The numbers could then be used as causal logic. Like 1.557 + 1.665 -&gt; 4.234. This would create a causal spaggetti code. These would represent something like dog + hungry expression -&gt; dog will seek food.  This is because the network experienced seeing a hungry dog, and then saw it eating food, so the logic center would make the causal connection.  


It could also see that dogs don't always have a hungry expression before they eat food. This would represent a weakened connection on some hypergraph. Or a ""!-&gt;"" relation.   Or even a statistical relation.  


Eventually, after the network is fully trained and has few disagreements on what it is experiencing, the numbers could be paired with words, representing learning language.  For example you could input a few pictures of animals running and the numbers which result could be paired with the word/tag ""running"".  

As the mirror networks get more and more trained similar ""objects/groups/archtypes"" from the outside world will group together in their numbers, creating Venn diagram like structures, which are each represented by symbols pairs.  For example, nouns, cats, frisbees.  Every group has the same causal behaviour.   

If trained networks disagree on what they are seeing, the causal logic center can step in. And the correct model is chosen.  

The best part of this is that there is no ego and no doer. Pure awareness(experiencer) and intelligence(thinker). No possibility for a robot uprising.  

At the start, the network might see two completely different things and experience two similar numbers, but the glorious thing is that those numbers don't represent anything yet. As the neural networks start to differentiate, the separate ""objects"" start to emerge. Similar output numbers would mean similar things.  For example numbers 1.002 to 1.009 could be different types of dogs. 

Once you start labelling the output numbers, you can start labelling them with pictures that triggered the experiencer neurons. This completes the input-output loop. It allows for memory and lets something re-experience something by putting in the image for analysis by the mirror networks.  

This explains why babies do not have memories. What neurons represent what experience are constantly in flux.   A picture that triggered one group of neurons early on would trigger another group of neurons later on.  

Babies also do not learn basic concepts at the same time they learn words, they spend a very long time just trying to figure out what they are experiencing.  ",15,0,False,self,,,,,

For each one of these flowers, I have 1000 participants tag a set of features. However, the features in this set are difficult to tag for humans, and while the majority of the data is accurate, some of the data is unreliable. There are also a small number of flowers that might be ""special cases"", i.e. might have mutations where the recorded data should point to one result, but actually (correctly) points to another result. All 1 million instances are correctly labeled by an oracle in addition to the 1000 human observations.

How do I go about training a model on such a dataset? Structurally speaking, I am not sure how to 'bundle' the 1000 observations per flower. I want to make sure that I am not simply predicting the petals on the flower for each observation, because any given observation could be incorrect, and any given flower has a small chance of being a mutant. I want to predict the number of petals on any given flower given all observations of the 1000 taggers, meaning that I essentially want to treat the bundle of 1000 observations per flower as a single observation, and train over 1 million training samples. 

The simplest naive way that I can think of doing this is to take an average per feature, perhaps also take into account standard deviation for applicable features. However, I feel as though there must be a more principled and effective way to approach this problem. The crux of the problem is that there may be multiple ""mutations"" or versions of a flower that all are valid instances of having n-petals, and training on a observation-by-observation basis throws valuable information about the existence of such mutations. This leads me to believe that perhaps I should do some kind of clustering based pre-processing step to cluster similar observations per petal-count pool, and produce a more granular label set that takes into account these mutations.

A few days ago I decided to implement mobilenets\_v1 from scratch in tensorflow and use the stanford dogs dataset to test it. However I've been stuck in a few days with this problem:

Upon starting training, I noticed that the final softmax layer was predicting the same class for all instances in the batch.

After some debugging I found out as the convolutions got deeper and deeper, their values were becoming the same on all instances, reaching the final fully connected layer on that state.

I've tried multiple weight initialization techniques, different activation functions (relu, relu6 and leaky relu) but with no avail.

Has anyone encountered a similar problem?

It's also easy if the entropy of the distribution is zero. I feel that it's nearly as easy if the entropy is nearly maximal or nearly zero. Then, under what condition on the entropy of the data distribution is it difficult for generative model to perform well? Is entropy not an appropriate measure for the difficulty? By performance of generative model, I mean the JSD (or KLD) of the model's outputs with the data distribution. The paper ""Exploring Generalization in Deep Learning"" proposed a complexity measure for NN's difficulty in learning a data distribution, but if I understand correctly, its analysis is not necessarily applicable to generative models.

Companies ranging from the manufacturing sector to the robotics and mechanical engineering sector are increasingly using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML.  
Beyond that, the AI concept has extended its impact to the financial markets through machine learning. Over the last two decades, markets have become more dynamic and trading using ML algorithms is seemingly taking over from the traditional exchange-based trading. Hedge fund managers and traders alike are now focusing on developing programs that assist their daily trading business in an effort to increase returns. 

![img](qs69fxjq2d511)

 There is also a recent trend for banks and finance firms to ask for more data analysis skills and market knowledge. This is quite rational, since understanding the economics behind the data and the market is as important as developing complex technical solutions.  
It is also a fact that human beings cannot be excluded from trading. However, the size of data required for making a good trade are increasingly bigger. For this reason, it is inevitable that at some point in the near future machines will become increasingly prevalent over humans on this task. Machines have the ability to quickly analyze data, news and tweets, process earnings statements, scrape websites, and trade on all these instantaneously. This ability will provide an invaluable tool for traders, fundamental analysts, equity long-short managers and macro investors.  
Nevertheless, humans still retain an advantage on seeing the big picture. Machines are still not very good at spotting market turning points and making forecasts involving human responses such as those of politicians and central bankers, or anticipating how markets are going to move. In addition to this, the data required for predicting the markets are getting more and more complex.  
This is why data scientists are getting increasingly sought after nowadays. Before machine learning strategies can be implemented, data scientists and quantitative researchers need to acquire and analyze the data with the aim of deriving tradable positions and trends.  
This data analysis is extremely complex. Todays datasets are much bigger than yesterdays. They can include anything from data generated by individuals (social media posts, product reviews, announcements, search trends, etc.), to data generated by business processes (company data, commercial transactions, trades etc)  
These new forms of data need to be thoroughly analyzed before they can be used in a trading strategy.

Machine learning includes many concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning and deep and reinforcement learning.  
The purpose of supervised learning is to establish a relationship between two datasets and to use one dataset to forecast the other.  
The purpose of unsupervised learning is to train an artificial intelligence algorithm using information that is neither classified nor labelled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.  
The purpose of deep learning is to use multi-layered neural networks to analyze a trend, while reinforcement learning uses algorithms to explore and find the most profitable trading strategies.  
As a result, the skills required for a data scientist is actually the same as for any other quantitative researchers. Existing buy side and sell side quants with backgrounds in computer science, statistics, maths, financial engineering, econometrics and natural sciences are continuously moving into this new field of expertise.

Apart from Machine Learning skills, expertise in software development is also a useful asset. Most of the Machine Learning methods and libraries are already there (e.g. in Python): you just need to know how to apply the existing models and be confident to modify them if required.

In general, the use of ML-based trading systems has started to make trading easier and more profitable. While these systems are common among both large hedge funds and smaller startups, third party trading software developers have also provided a new way for individual traders to get in the game.  
All the above have changed the way traders are doing their every day jobs. We are living in an era where making money in the stock market is not only a question of how experienced you are, but also of how powerful your trading tool is.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I've been working on a prediction problem with a fairly strong class imbalance using tree ensembles. I have no problems with too much or too little data, but I do read everywhere that addressing class imbalance improves predictive power.

However, most of the papers (including the \[paper\]([https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302)) for SMOTE) evaluate their performance in terms of benefits to the Area under the ROC curve (AuROC). This is not the best or most informative metric to use as the AuROC metric is sensitive to class imbalance. See \[this paper\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349800/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349800/)) which explains why the Area under Precision-Recall (AuPR) metric is better in such situations. Essentially, AuROC is boosted when the classifier correctly predicts either a True Positive or a True Negative, which in cases of class imbalance can lead to drastic inflation of the score due to the True Negatives making up the majority of the dataset. The AuPR score only increases when the model correctly identifies a True Positive.

To address that, the SMOTE paper evaluates the AuROC on a separate balanced dataset each time it rebalances. However, the improvements to their AuROC score still derive from tradeoffs between precision and recall, making the benefits of the technique difficult to assess. (Moreover the AuROC benefits were marginal and susceptible to the multiple comparisons problem).

In my experience, using simple undersampling or oversampling techniques never changed my AuPR score, and only served to make me recalibrate my probability predictions. SMOTE, however, seems to be a fairly sophisticated technique and I have not seen it being questioned. Despite this, I can find no literature involving the AuPR metric. 

Am I understanding something incorrectly? Do any of you have any experience with SMOTE and evaluating SMOTE, or other class balancing techniques? Did SMOTE or other class balancing techniques improve your predictive power?

Thank you so much!",14,9,False,self,,,,,

While learning to program I didn't use wikipedia as a source much because other reliable info (in more digestible format) was available, but for machine learning the sources can be very unreliable and sometimes hard to come by.

For a couple of examples, last semester I did a LSTM in numpy, all of the guides I could find were incomplete or wrong, focusing on the intuition and not the algorithms and code. One guide had a professional looking video to go along with it and with his code each back prop and feed forward took on average SEVENTY FOUR SECONDS. That is not what we should be teaching the kids. 

Recently I was trying to do a GAN in keras. I read the paper first and then looked through at least 10 implementations that all seemed wrong before learning in a comment thread keras was inflexible for this task and you needed to train it with tensorflow.

In the former case, a model definition and training algorithm in psuedo code like the merge sort article, and in the later case a note in the ""implementations"" section of an article would also have saved me a huge amount of time. 

Then there's the problem of dissemination of research, it seems like stumbling across the paper / method relevant to you requires too much luck. 

Then there's incomplete sources, research papers that leave out their model definitions, algorithms, data sets, and code. While it couldn't make up for what people leave out it could give you the accepted approach, corresponding data sets, and benchmarks against other methods.

During the training, I report the reward for each batch, and the A3C without LSTM can get reward that converges to 200.

However, the reward of A3C with LSTM can converge to 200 with a moderately large variance. After the reward staying close to or on 200 for a  long time ('long' means you have seen reward 200 for many batches, and thought the model succeeded), the reward will suddenly decrease to a small value like 15, and then slowly converge to 200 for the next batches.  I observed such cases for several times even I keep training. 

Could you have any suggestion? 

BTW, I use LSTM in A3C, because based on some paper like CVPR 18 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04595](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04595) and ICML 18 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10561](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10561), LSTM can memorize the history states ,which can improve the A3C.

I am a law student and in couple of months I will start to write my optional mid-studies thesis. I would like to tackle problems in the field of AI from legal point of view, however I am suffering from general lack of thesis.

I am mostly looking for problems related to intellectual property, if not then secondly related to legal responsibility of AI (but no self-driving cars, it has been beaten to death already) and lastly about application of AI in judicial proceedings.

However I am opened to any suggestions you might have (facial recognition, ethical problems...). Anything that you feel that this field faces or might face in near future from legal point of view. Did you already ran into some related problems?

Feel free to make it as technical as possible, for what it's worth (honestly not much) since I am interested in this ""intersection"" I am familiar with some of the underlying concepts, can code in python and took several AP courses in maths and stats, so bring it on bois.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions or tips you might have for me, it would really help my studies.



Edit: I don't want to end up on /r/choosingbeggars but preferably it should be something ""new"" (hence the slefdriving cars) and preferably some really specific problems that I could form my thesis around. But of course any insight will be appreciated. And yes, you will get credit in the thesis.

Eugene says things that will make many stakeholders in the DS community uncomfortable or defensive (myself included):  

\- The lack of depth many data scientists display 

\- The problem with IT owning DS 

\- The lack of understanding of DS from mgt teams 

\- The lack of rigor (e.g. most ppl see no diff b/n prediction &amp; causation) 

\- DS by &amp; large is not necessary for most orgs.

While I know genomics is probably not everyone's specific area of interest, I did write a couple of sections that help explain some background on machine learning and how it differs from statistics (Section II), with heavy references to concepts Leo Breiman's ""Two Cultures"" paper from 2001. There is also discussion about common errors in both classical statistics and machine learning. Section I introduces radiogenomics. Section III has discussions about how ML can be applied to genomics and how to handle some challenges. Section IV discusses common ML models used in radiogenomics. Section V discusses how to improve ML in radiogenomics.

However, would models not want to incorporate some 'rule based/exception' learning, in the sense that in the case of rare examples occurring, some set of neurons encoding that occurrence become active, and thence feeds into classification/prediction etc. One way of encoding this through a deep network would seem to be using some L_1 regularization for one subset of nodes (encouraging sparse activation) and L_2 regularization for others (encouraging some 'generalist' neurons for common behaviour) Yet, it seems to me that RMSProp/Adagrad would tend to destroy this 'contextual/sparse' activation by increasing the learning for sparse nodes, and hence forcing them to act in solving the general loss minimization instead of performing a specialized function. Is this an actual issue, and could one perhaps choose to use RMSProp/Adagrad with a subset of 'L_2 regularized neurons', while having another subset which uses a different gradient optimization along with L_1?

I can produce myriads of ground-truth labeled training examples for those two superclasses. But ultimately in order to get valuable physics knowledge, I need to divide my signal class into subclasses and here comes the problem. The only way to make training data for those two classes is via numerical simulations, but those insert a lot of noise into the model, for example, coming from inner workings of the model e.t.c.

The de-facto way how it is done now is that we take few models, simulate signals for subclasses and train our models directly on those data. But the question that always has bothered me is - can we use our knowledge of superclass signal vs background data to which we can assign ground-truth label in combination with simulated data? We have petabytes of those, generated by nature itself. 

What would be the learning paradigm that utilises those ideas called? Can you please provide some references for those?

This quantity is not equal to the perplexity of the language model, which uses its predictions instead of the generated sequences (they are slightly different). The former is probably smaller, but I'm not sure about how much the difference would be. If we know the amount of difference, then we can conclude the reduction of perplexity due to beam search. Unfortunately, calculating the former perplexity is intractable, so is there any way to approximate the difference between the former and the latter? One naive approach is to train a LM on generated sequences, but I doubt the result's numerical accuracy. Any thought?

For example, I have an autoencoder with discrete latent variable (of length slightly shorter than the input texts) that models the test dataset with log-ppl being 0.3. Then, on average the model assigns e^(-0.3) = 75% to the correct next token on test dataset. Doesn't this mean that beam search (or even greedy decoding) would bring the likelihood to nearly 100% (i.e. the net perplexity being 0), since the probability mass in this case is pretty much concentrated on the correct next tokens? Is such a drastic improvement in terms of perplexity limited to models with log-ppl near 0?

* The  combination of methods was the king of the M4. Of the 17 most accurate  methods, 12 were combinations of mostly statistical approaches.
* The  biggest surprise was a hybrid approach that utilised both statistical  and ML features. This method produced both the most accurate forecasts  and the most precise PIs, and was submitted by Slawek Smyl, a Data  Scientist at Uber Technologies. According to sMAPE, it was close to 10&amp;#37;  more accurate than the combination benchmark.
* The  second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical  methods and an ML one, with the weights for the averaging calculated by  an ML algorithm that was trained to minimise the forecasting error  through holdout tests. This method was submitted jointly by Spains  University of A Corua and Australias Monash University.
* The  most accurate and second most accurate methods also achieved an amazing  success in specifying the 95&amp;#37; PIs correctly. These are the first  methods we are aware of that have done so, rather than underestimating  the uncertainty considerably.
* The  six pure ML methods that were submitted in the M4 all performed poorly,  with none of them being more accurate than Comb and only one being more  accurate than Nave2. This supports the findings of the latest PLOS ONE  paper by Makridakis, Spiliotis and Assimakopoulos.

Is there a consensus as to 'Best Practices' or general considerations one should make when thinking about how to use machine learning for predictive analytics and enterprise level decision support?  

I'm not necessarily referring to (but maybe) ad-hoc data scientist requests like:  go find some data, wrangle a dataset, train a model, and classify a prediction.  Often times, that sort of data doesn't persist (yes, I am making gross generalizations here).

What I'm wondering about is how an organization could approach its data architecture to make semantic connections across the various business entities and critical knowledge assets, avoid data integration problems, and exploit those assets to machine learning for various decision support activities.  

Is SOA-related data architectures the best practice here?  Maybe the Data Mart (master data management), or data lake approach?  What does this community think about graph databases for enterprise level analytics??

I just found out that I got rejected from a ML role with one of the big ML companies. I got rejected at the coding interview stage, without getting to the point where they ask me any ML related questions. I know this is bit of a whinge but I studied pretty hard for the past 6 months, spending money on training courses (leetcode + udemy), taking time off to study and doing my best to balance study and life. So its a little heartbreaking to know that a 40 minute coding test just stopped you from going further.

Anyway, the reason I'm quite adamant about being at a large company is that I really want a mentor in DL. I did do my PhD (in Bayesian ML) and worked in the data science space but I feel like there's still large gaps in my knowledge. The two areas I want to learn more about is DL in distributed settings (eg. with kubernetes) and reinforcement learning. The latter at least udacity seems to have a good course on it.

I know I only applied to one company, and I should apply for more. But thought I'd get people's input before going further. So here are my questions:

1. I know the coding interview is pretty standard, but are there well known ML companies that have something else instead? eg. A take home task, or questions on ML straightaway without the coding interview?

2. Have I got the wrong mindset only applying for big software companies (google, fb etc.?) Is it worth applying for startups in SF? I know there's a demand but will I meet a suitable mentor. Then there's the question of working hours and (low) salary when it comes to startups.

3. Do recruiters have a tougher standard for people living overseas considering its more expensive to hire them? Thinking mostly about relocation fees + sponsorship. &lt;- This might be more of a question for recruiters than this forum.",5,2,False,self,,,,,

I am a research scientist at a top ten computer science university by day, but I have been spending the last ""240 minutes"" of my day trying to develop my own brand or start some sort of side hustle. This is all with support of my wife and son (to give some context). Personally, I think as a freelancer, I am worth at least 100$ an hour. I think that is on the low end of the spectrum, because while I have experience implementing many ML/DL models -- I'm new to freelancing.

In general, I have seen people commonly posting they charge 20-40 bucks an hour on UpWork. This number would be fine if you were an employee at some organization where they take on much of the overhead (you don't have to find work, they take on the financial responsibility of that)... but as freelancers we are operating on our own brand usually in our off time.

Let me explain why I think this is a bit crazy with a few bullet points.

* You are spending resources to find work (off hours, etc) UNPAID
* You are spending resources not investing in your own brand (working on your own startup, personal projects, reading textbooks)
* You are spending resources not doing the things you love (Hanging out with family, playing dark souls).
* ML takes a large time investment (heck even programming), and there is large demand
* ML has the potential to earn huge profits for companies
* There are operating costs (similar to resources i.e. electricity bill)
* You have to research constantly to stay at start of the art level
* Time is valuable, especially to someone who has the ability to develop ML models. You have to invest lots (FOR FREE).
* Not even including large expenses like insurance and taxes (if you are full time).

I think in general, there is a huge opportunity in the ML world. Charging 20-40 bucks an hour just doesn't capture the opportunity cost (in my opinion) of running your own brand. I think to capture your opportunity and operating costs, you could easily multiply the hourly rate you expect to receive at a large company (\~40?) and multiply that by 2.5-3.5. In fact, I think that's what large companies do because you cost more than just your take home. I think a more reasonable price range would be 100$(beginner-intermediate)-200$(expert) hourly (as high as that sounds). Frankly, I think it should be even more as I think working on personal projects or our own business would likely be a better long-term investment. It should take some serious cash to get us to spend time on some sponsors project.

Maybe this is preaching to the choir, or I am a lunatic expecting way too much money. I think the bottom line is that there are some machine learning peoples out really undercutting their skills, and I would be interested if this community has noticed any trends in this regard.",37,30,False,self,,,,,

I have limited opportunities of advancing in this area on my current job, I can apply ML here and there, but nothing especially groundbreaking or interesting. 

So, I am thinking about more efficient ways about getting into ML, and especially ML research. Could you recommend me ways to get into this fields.

I haven't worked with pytorch so I would definitely have to learn it if I had a shot at translating it. From what I've looked at I think I would prefer to work in keras and tensorflow because I can make my code prettier. 

But is this even a good idea if I want to recreate and expand upon their results? Would I have to rewrite half the fairseq library? 

I read that differences in how things like math operations are implemented can have a pretty big impact. Not to mention the other larger implementation details that are all under the hood.  

I do have access to a proper cluster if that makes a difference.

I've occasionally encountered with a certain characteristic distribution of losses in each target sequence: for a certain token, the error is significantly larger than on other target tokens, and these tokens dominantly contribute to the overall loss. This means that, as training progresses and most but a small number of tokens have a tiny loss, the overall loss is essentially equal to the fraction of the sum of losses on tokens with large loss over the number of all tokens. Since the number of tokens with large loss is much smaller than the number of all tokens in a minibatch, the gradient is small. In order to make the gradient large, we can add to the usual loss term the correction term that is the cross entropy over tokens with large loss only (the ones above a certain threshold). I haven't tested this loss. It this kind of technique well-known? If so, could you list some relevant references? Overfitting isn't an issue in my case. I'm not certain if this is a commonplace issue, but I'd like to at least fix it for my problem.

My &lt;not so good&gt; solution was to use a convolutional GRU and feed the network with one frame at a time, and let the hidden state aggregate what's important to save.

Im a ML noob that needs direction on how to train a NN for a Bejeweled style game. Ive looked into Q-Learning, RL and MCTS but am confused, mainly because of the nr of possible states for this game seems to be too big (64^8 possible grid positions). Am I interpreting above mentioned techniques in an uncorrect manner? What is your advice? What would be the best way to implement such a bot, and how could I learn to do so? 

Hi all,

**Background**
Im relatively new to the ML field; only started studying AI this year at uni. The stuff they teach at school is very theoretical and basic. I understand this is nescesarry, but I really want to get my hands dirty. Already did some work on the basic stuff like MNIST and spoken digits datasets, but I want to delve deeper in more sophistocated techniques. Got decent Python coding skills

**The Project**
I want to make a game bot for the android game ""Zookeeper Battle"" using deep learning. This game is like Bejeweled where you switch tiles in a grid to make combinations. 

**What I have**
- Win32api functions for controlling Windows (drags, clicks, etc)
- A way of recognizing the grid and turning it into a Numpy array representation
- A way of making moves using Win32api
- A basic main() function

**Where Im stuck**
Im basically stuck at 'the brain' of the bot: hoe to select *which* move should be carried out. How do I train a NN for such a game? Where do I start? If i use RL, I need to come up with a way of constructing a 'reward'. A thing that bugs me as well is the fact that the nr of states seems huge; 64^8 board positions which would lead to a policy table with an insane amount of rows. Or am I misinterpreting 'states'? Shouls I make a preselection of possible moved and go from there?

Ive got so many questions but am determined to make this work. And no, I would rather not try by starting with something easier. I think I tend to learn more from taking on something difficult right away.

Help/ideas/advice/resources would be greatly appreciated!",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I am an undergraduate in management, and for the last two years have been working on data analysis. I am interested in doing a Master in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I dont pick favourites with my countries, so Europe/USA/Canada/Australia any of them work for me. 

Now, I was confident in joining the master until I stumbled across reddit and started reading your masters recommendations. I feel I lack some strong mathematical background to join the fray, and seriously, I dont even know the professors you mention. Still, most masters entry  requirements are *low*. For example, I could apply to University of Edinburgh, since I meet the 60 credits in maths (even though  I am an undergrad in management). I have not lost touch with programming, but I would not consider myself an expert.

For those who are currently in a master (or have been) what do you think of the requirements? Do you think a strong mathematical and programming background is needed? Or did your master help you get to the required level?

In Advance, thank you

Labels are created manually and it's time-consuming (e.g. the case of semantic segmentation). I can make tools to improve on the time it takes to make labels, but I also know that my currently trained model already yields somewhat correct outputs. Knowing this, I want to use my model to generate initial labels and improve them by hand. This should take less time than creating labels from scratch. I also want this to be in an online fashion, so that the model may improve as I go.

This approach seems very intuitive, and most people working in ML have probably already thought about it. However I don't see popular articles or paper that make use of this approach. I see the following drawbacks:

- Creation of a bias in the labels, especially complex ones. You're likely to accept labels created by the model as they are when they're sometimes partially correct.

- It's not easy to obtain a full sample efficiency: should older samples be seen in training more often than new ones? Issue of mode collapse.

- Improvements in the model become slower with higher orders in the amount of data, i.e. the model improves slower than the time you spend labeling is cut back. In other words, it doesn't scale for problems that require a lot of data.

And the attractive parts:

- Efficient manual labeling, potentially more so than specialized tools.

- ""Inside"" look at the performance of the model on unseen data (good for debugging).

- Good idea of how much data is needed to get good results, and when to stop.

I'm very interested in what you think about this. Your opinion on the legitimacy of the method, similar alternatives and existing research on the topic.

Then I create a model (Model A) that can tell the difference between human speech and this cheap text-to-speech software 95% of the time.

Then I create another model, say Model B, that takes the cheap, synthesized voice and makes it sound human. It does this by using Model A to train - it changes a bit every training step until it gets a ""RESULT: HUMAN"" (1 instead of 0) from Model A every time it outputs something.

Then, say we do another model(C) that takes that(B) as input, and compares it to _real_ human speech again, and tells us which is which with high accuracy (if it's still possible?). Then we do another model (D) that takes model B as input, and trains using Model C until Model C also says it always sounds human.

Maybe we could do this a few more times, or have other models that are specifically designed to take human speech output from B or D and make it sound happy, sad, excited, etc... using the exact same method (would imagine this would be a spectrum (0-10), like a rainbow, one colour for each emotion, and the spectrum being an input to the final layer, maybe have some more spectrums for things like angry-happy, old, tired, young, male, female, etc...

I've thought up something to sort of test this using the mnist-tensorflow tutorial - it would take a 10-length array and output a 32x32 image and use the mnist digit analyzing model to train itself. Eventually would add sliders as an input to test ""hastily-written"" vs ""slowly written"" and ""hard to read"" vs ""easy to read"", and stuff like that, but would be a pain in the ass to sort all that without a bunch of help.

**TL,DR**: possible to train a neural network to notice the difference between human and robot output, and then use that to train another neural network until it generates output that the first NN always says is human?

between the mammalian prefrontal cortex and birds' corresponding 'nidopallium caudolaterale'?  Both support reasoning by analogy for decision-making. Recent work seems to be mostly paywalled.

https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Nidopallium

    The experiment sought to measure the densities of various
    neurotransmitter receptors in both the avian NCL and the
    human prefrontal cortex, using quantitative in-vitro receptor
    autoradiography.  It was found that the NCL contained lower
    absolute quantities of these neuronal receptors. However, 
    the experiment also revealed that the relative densities of 
    these receptors in both organisms were surprisingly similar.
    With this, there is the possible implication that the capability 
    for such sophisticated mental processes in these structures is
    reliant on the receptor architecture of the neurons which 
    comprise them.

The problem is rather simple to explain: Given the DOM tree of an HTML page, assign a label 0/1 to each node whether is relevant or not to our goal. Maybe could also be seen as a regression one, and assign a probability or likeness to each node, I don't know. Some examples of this could be product gallery extraction from online shops, article content extraction or ad removal.

I suppose that the information the classifier should take into account is: the content, type and attributes of the node together with its position inside the tree to decide if its relevant. 
 I've searched the literature, but I'm not really sure I've found anything relevant. This is not my area of expertise, so pardon me if I've missed some obvious paper or equivalence between problems.

Could anyone point me to prior work or suggest an idea about how to confront it?

I graduated with a bachelor in Statistics and have been working as a data scientist for about 4 years after graduation.

This year, I decided to go to grad school and got accepted from two master programs in the UK,

[Oxford MSc Statistical Science](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/study-here/taught-postgraduate/msc-in-statistical-science/) and [UCL MSc Machine Learning](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/)

If my goal is to pursue a PhD in the field of Statistical Machine Learning in Europe, what do you think would be a better option in this case considering that I am an international student.

It would be super helpful for me to have opinions from you guys so that I can eventually make my decision. Thank you so much!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

If I were to use one of the popular  automatic differentiation packages to train a deep neural net, how  reproducible would my results be? Assuming I've set the seed and  controlled for any other obvious gotchas, would I be able to reproduce  the weights in a deep neural net exactly (to machine precision) on two successive training runs?

In a  traditional ML algorithm, the answer to that would be ""yes, obviously"".  But for deep neural nets, the computations are orders of magnitude  bigger, and run in parallel. I don't know enough about low-level  programming or the ISO float standard to guarantee that 1/ truncation  errors don't get propagated in a non-deterministic manner, and 2/ that  race conditions in a graphics card won't cause non-deterministic  behaviour in my training batch.

There's a lot more to a post that matters to its sentiment. For example context, where doesn't seem to much discussion. One very basic example where context is important is the following: a negative tweet or Reddit comment that itself is booing a negative comment is considered negative. Of course, the negative tweet may actually be counted ""in favor"" of the original topic.

The relevant fields in NLP would be [coreference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference), and possibly other subfields involving semantics. Basically, these fields work on the very difficult task of disentangling the meaning behind sentences. They can be used to figure out what the participants were discussing. It's hard to find any of these techniques publicly used.

  
Another strategy of getting around the above issues are skillful ""hacks"" that rely on domain knowledge. One example of this is just using top level comments in Reddit. Maybe there is a universe of such tricks and techniques to get around the issues of context. But this doesn't seem satisfying and certainly discards useful information.

I'm mostly used to Stack Overflow posting guidelines, so let me know what I can do to improve my posts here, or if this isn't the right place for a post like this. (Thanks!)

It looks like there are a [lot](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/extra_capsnets.ipynb) of [different](https://github.com/bourdakos1/capsule-networks) [implementations](https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks/blob/master/capsLayer.py) of Capsule Networks in TensorFlow. However, most of these seem to be versions of [https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow).

My issue with naturomic's (Huadong Liao) implementation is that it's hard-coded specifically for MNIST.

For example, there are assert statements like assert caps1.get\_shape() == \[cfg.batch\_size, 1152, 8, 1\]  
 that only make sense if you're using a dataset with the same dimensions as MNIST.

Are there any implementations of Capsule Networks for TensorFlow that are more general?

If not, I'll try to go about making my own, probably by working from [naturomic's implementation](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow) and replacing the MNIST constants with variables and editable properties.

I have tried using both Python scripts and Jupyter Noebooks. I find  using Jupyter Notebooks to be quick while writing and debugging code.  You can always see the shape of the tensors you are manipulating. You can check if the values appear right. Your plot appears in the same  place. You can interact with your model, check how it is performing on custom input, stop it while training, lower the learning rate, etc.

But writing python scripts has its own benefits. You save writing  redundant code for different experiments. For changing some line in a  function you don't have to change that function in all the experiments'  codes. You can also run these scripts directly through the command line.  

Please point out to some resources or give some advice on best coding  practices and how to organise code. If possible please link to some GitHub  repos where you think codes for different experiments is organised in an efficient manner. ",23,116,False,self,,,,,
