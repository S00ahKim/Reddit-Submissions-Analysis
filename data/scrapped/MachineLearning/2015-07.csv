I will soon be going for a postdoc position at a new university. One thing that the panelist asked me to think of is if I were to start, what would I work on.

Now the thing is so far with my PhD someone has always given me a problem and I went away and worked out the maths behind it. 

So my question is what are the upcoming areas in theoretical BAYESIAN machine learning. My speciality I would say is in Variational Bayes. I like this area because 1. Fast compared to sampling 2. There is quite a bit of maths involved.

New areas that I want to get into is stochastic Variational Bayes. This is a technique that helps deal with big data. This answer in itself didn't seem satisfactory. So I'm putting it out there to see what would be a good area/ project to work on. Something theoretical but might have a real world application. I'm happy to consider things like Deep Learning as long as there are mathematical problems involved.

p.s. yes I realise this might be quite open ended",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Reading through it, though, I began to wonder whether **this application is part of a [Sokal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair)-style gambit whose ultimate goal is to overhaul the patent process for algorithms and similar intellectual property**.

Could Google be trying to make a point amid all the patent trolling going on these days?  In other words, if the patent *is* granted, could Google come out and say that it was intentionally written to be as vague as possible and designed to hide (albeit poorly) how derivative the idea ultimately is?  Could one of the biggest companies in the world then publicly say that its own patent should never have been granted?

A Google-engineered embarrassment for the USPTO could be enough to turn the tide for how tech patents are evaluated.  Such [point-making hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#Similar_incidents) have occurred before, with the ""[Sokal affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair)"" being one of the most famous.

It's just that I have an image in my head that I'd really like to make a reality, but I utterly suck at AI-programming.

The thing I have in mind is this:

A white background filled with colored dots. Every colored dot is like a living being, meaning it can take a few actions, it has a few needs and it has a few feelings. The actions it can take are: changing its color and moving around. The needs it has are:

* Being around other dots X percent of the time
* Being alone (100 - X) percent of the time
* Being (around) cold colors Y percent of the time
* Being (around) warm colors (100 - Y) percent of the time
* Dancing and moving Z percent of the time
* Staying calm and still (100 - Z) percent of the time.

X, Y and Z differ per dot and that's what makes every dot a unique living being. And finally it feels pleasant feelings when it just fulfilled one of its needs and it feels unpleasant feelings when one of its needs have not been fulfilled recently.

A dot is not aware of its needs, its only aware of its feelings and tries to take actions that lead to pleasant feelings.

I imagine that this app would create a beautiful ""dance of life"" to look at. All the dots will just try stuff out to find out what's the nicest way to live. And what I most like about this app is the very clear absence of right and wrong / normal and abnormal. Some dots will like to dance and change color wildly all the time and other dots will like to stay still and stay the same color all the time and neither is better than the other.

I like the idea of turning the topic mappings from LDA into word clouds with the relative 'importance' of each term being represented by size in the cloud. Something similar as what is done [here](http://voidpatterns.org/2015/03/conspiracy-theories-topic-modeling-keyword-extraction/). Going by the blog post it seems that the beta parameter is what gives us the relative weight of each term in the topic. When I examine my betas I get values ranging from approximately  -6 to -12. The negative values suggest that maybe this is a log likelihood measure? I don't really have the stats background to confidently say how to best map the betas to a metric that could play nice with word clouds frequency.  parameter. Any advice is much appreciated.

I am not sure if this is a subreddit that is okay with people asking for help, but everything else on this topic is pretty dead. Happy to re-post in a more appropriate place if needed. Also, it doesn't really matter in this case but I am implementing this in R.

I've successfully created both networks and can project the output of the lstm to the input of the classifier, but I get issues when I try to activate and perhaps train it.

First, it trains very quickly ( but, granted, I'm training it with 2 simple, inputs so that might not be an issue ). But it trains with out error. I train it with a single input as it has one input neuron and then 5 outputs for each class.

Now when I activate it, I don't get an error, but I get that all of the outputs are undefined: `[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]` with an activation of `[0]`, which was explicitly trained.

I'd greatly appreciate any help in getting this small deep network working. Each network works individually, but I believe there is an issue in training both together.

I haven't any experience with them, barring reading about the theory and playing with some CNNs on image data. 
Currently, my results are quite poor, despite a lot of playing with reasonable (I think) network parameters. 
**I want to get a ""sanity check"" regarding whether I missed something obvious**. The better parameters I could find just barely outperform (F1 &amp; ROC_AUC metrics) a bog standard logistic regression with a tuned C, implemented in scikit-learn - and an SVM with an RBF kernel strongly outperforms the LogReg itself. Being outperformed by a different model (e.g. Decision trees) would make plenty of sense, but a Neural Net should be able to do anything a LogReg can. The code/nets are all implemented in Keras and/or Lasagne (I'm experimenting with both). 

#Data Details: 
Training+ Evaluation set hold ~2,491 samples (~800 positive class) - Binary classification. Metric of choice is the F1 score. 
 Features: ~1,200 ""raw"". Filtering the set to remove zero variance features, along with a FDR (ANOVA) test (alpha = 0.01) drops that down to 500 features. (An FDR with an alpha of 0.7 drops it down to about ~900 features. Many features are co-linear; Applying a PCA on the data dropped performance notably, and reduced the NNet performance more than the LogRegs ). 
Features are sequence properties for a protein, manually extracted, and not necessarily sharing any form of spatial order (e.g. one feature is the count of each letter in a sequence). There are DEFINITELY higher order interactions between features. 
Features are a mix of variables (e.g. ""propensity for X= -0.21"") and counts (e.g. ""AA@position 7 = R"" (1 hot encoded)). Data is normalized (using sklearn).

One is Host and the other is Network. The host creates a matrix of a given size, distributes neurons into 3 layers (1 input [layer 1], 1 output [layer 3] and the rest on a middle hidden layer [layer 2]). It gives each neuron as many random weights than there are neurons, a value between 0 and 4. I then input a number which is given to the input neuron's value, and it runs Network.

Network will take each neuron in order, check if his layer is not input, then for each neuron whose layer is right before him (so layer-1) it will multiply its value by the given weight for that neuron and add it to its own value. It goes on like this and then displays the output neuron's value. Back to the Host.

Host will divide the obtained number by the wanted number (input*2) and will see how much correction is needed. It will then apply the correction to each and every weight on the grid. So if the output was 2x the wanted value, it will divide each weight by 2.

Bottom line is that it works, but I'm really unsure whether it qualifies as a neural network as it's easy and fast and the correction part seems like cheating. Also, the less neurons I have the faster it reaches optimal values (around the goal) and I doubt that's how it's supposed to be.

Previous reddit comments have said ""don't hate the player, hate the game"", i.e., we should blame the US patent laws for allowing patents on well-known abstract ideas; that Google might as well exercise its legal rights.

I am afraid that Google has just started an arms race, which could do significantly damage to academic research in machine learning.
Now it's likely that other companies using machine learning will rush to patent every research idea that was developed in part by their employees.
We have all been in a prisoner's dilemma situation, and Google just defected.
Now researchers will guard their ideas much more combatively, given that it's now fair game to patent these ideas, and big money is at stake.

Even if Google never publicly sues based on these patents, and besides the damage to academic culture that could result from this new trend, there are at least two other reasons for concern:
1. In computer vision, SIFT and SURF features were patented. This caused major annoyances for open-source software libraries like OpenCV. The Debian repos did not contain the ""nonfree"" module, so users had to build from source, which was a major hassle. The same thing may happen in future open-source machine learning libraries.
2. These new patents cast doubt on any new company based on machine learning and make it harder to attract investments -- now there is the looming threat that Google has rights to their IP and can sue or at least use the patents as a bargaining chip in case of a legal dispute.

Suppose we consider Ruslan's paper in which he proposes the likelihood estimation using AIS on RBMs. In his paper he uses the MNIST data for handwritten digits. While training the RBMs do we use the knowledge that a particular picture corresponds to a particular digit? If so then when I have a test digit the RBM will only tell me some  probability about a particular digit. what is the use of this probability, however, because this doesn't tell me anything about the test data. If that is not the case then what does the RBM exactly do after we have trained it on so many image samples?

This problem only gets worse for longer videos, where most people either drop off at the beginning, or use the video player scrubber to randomly scan the video in the hopes of finding something interesting. With ClipMine, we are reimagining online video by making video players more aware of the content being played. We use both *crowd-sourcing* and *machine intelligence* to tag interesting points inside online videos. Then, using our Content-Aware Video Player, anyone can share or embed their tagged videos with their audience to help them discover and view the content that matters most to them.

All of the YUV values are just linear functions of RGB values. It should be trivial to convert the first layer of weights between YUV and RGB and vice versa.

E.g. a neuron with a weight of 1 to the Y dimension, would be converted to a neuron with 0.3 R,  0.6 G, and 0.1 B. It's exactly equivalent.

In fact the NN should be able to learn the weights as if the image was in any color space it likes.

This fall I'm starting my MSc programme, and would like to get myself an internship for the next summer. I have a decent background in software engineering and math. I have passed several courses on machine learning, and comfortable with reading research papers. I did several internships during my undergrad study: one was a SWE-internship in Silicon Valley, another was a recommender systems research at a local company.

The job of my dream would be that at DeepMind (well, who wouldn't say that?), but I do realize that I have no research experience (i.e. published papers), so I aim a bit lower.
Another thing to note: I don't feel like these Data Science roles are right for me. I see them mostly as stats guys doing stuff in their excel / r / matlab with the outcome of better understanding your processes / audience, whereas SW guys deliver new features.
And the final note is that I plan to do a lot of research during my MSc so in 2 years I can get into a decent PhD programme. Thus, good recommendation letters are a plus.

Sorry for the lengthy introduction. So my questions are:

 * What are my chances to get this kind of internship being a Master's student? Haven't they all been taken by hungry Phds? :-)
 * What can I do to improve these chances? I have something like 3-4 months before the applications start.
 * How should I position myself (both in CV and during interviews): should I emphasis my software engineering experience, my research attitude (mostly lots of ML-related courses), or something else.
 * How does an interview for such positions look like? Is it usual SW-interview (algorithms, programming techniques, etc) without any emphasis on ML part, or quite the reverse?

TL;DR math-and-software-engineering heavy internship without business-shit is wanted. Preferably at a top company. And then there're 4 silly questions I want wisdom of reddit to answer.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I have been submitting an article repeatedly to CVPR/ICCV/ECCV since 2013 that is a reasonably simple method, is well-formulated showing promising results on benchmark datasets. While all the reviewers in all my submissions seem to agree that my proposal is novel and that it is indeed superior to many SOTA and often times I get even more positive reviews, I get rejected on the notion that my method is ""simple"". I write rebuttals arguing the elegance and the superiority of my methods and while everyone agrees with everything I say, there is always still one reviewer who gives a borderline or a weak reject based on the fact that its not ""complicated enough"". Now I am also being forced to switch topics ( I am entering my fourth year of PhD) because of this reason.

Here is my question: Many I have talked to seem to think that conferences like CVPR now focus more on engineering and on results rather than on novelty. Is this true ? If this is indeed true what are my alternatives to get my paper published. It is indeed a good method and shows good results and IMO fills a void in the literature, which quite frankly should have been filled ages ago. I really think that my paper should have been written in early part of last decade. Secondly, is it acceptable to switch topics so late in my PhD. I am thinking of getting into deep learning. Will I be perceived differently post-graduation, if at all I get to graduate in time, about my late change of topics ? 

[Update]: Thanks for all the suggestions.

It seems like the problem is that, when it stops exploring, it just keeps increasing the Q-values of states that it's already deemed the best in the past. So for example, it visits the price 5 at a certain state and time and gets a reward. Then, in the next several episodes, it continues to visit 5, and continues getting a reward, adding that reward to the Q-value until it's pretty high. At that point, even if it were to explore at the same state and time, the reward it gets isn't enough to overcome the inflated Q-value, so it just goes right back to 5 in the next episode. There must be something wrong with my interpretation of how this is supposed to work, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.

- **What are other requirement other than CPU / GPU / RAM ?**  
- **Is there any reason to use an UNIX OS if I'm used to coding on Windows?**  
- **Finally, what's a good example of a machine one should buy today with a 1k budget? 1.5k? 2k?**

In this recent, very interesting [post](http://yosinski.com/deepvis) (Jason Yosinski et al.), ""natural image priors"" are described as follows:

""To produce more recognizable images, researchers have tried optimizing images to  (1) maximally activate a neuron, and (2) have styles similar to natural images (e.g. not having pixels be at extreme values). These pressures for images to look like normal images are called natural image priors or regularization."" 

Lets say, we got a synthetic image, produced with a BAD ""natural image prior"".
Questions:
(1) This image activates a neuron maximally, but does not look like a natural image at all. Correct?
(2) This image fools the DNN, as it is very confidently classified wrong and corresponds to an ""adversarial image"" (Goodfellow et al.). Correct?
(3) Overall, on a higher level, does that mean that we - as humans - are trying to provide the DNN with our prior knowledge of the world? Is this the goal of whichever ""regularization"" ?

Any ideas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3cu3pp/reinforcement_learning_or_fully_convolutional/,zZJollyGreenZz,1436558575,"My dataset is similar to the idea for grayscale rice or mitosis detection , but I seem to run into issues using non-learning methods, such as adaptive thresholding and/or the OTSU method.  Essentially I need to run an algorithm at a coarse resolution to generate possible detections/boxes.  Each box will be followed up by a multi-class convnet that examines the area at a high resolution.  I currently have the multi-class convnet working, and it works very well!, but a sliding window approach is just too slow.  The events at the coarse
resolution are relatively sparse, so it would be nice to use a smaller convnet or other learning algorithm to search for areas of interest that could be classified with the multi-class convnet using the high resolution data.


I am wondering if there is a good way to do:

binary image segmentation

and/or

bounding box detection / regression


for detection of rice kernels or mitosis cells in a grayscale image with varying backgrounds and interference.


It seems like there might be a way to perform the task with reinforcement learning or by using a method similar to ""Fully Convolutional Semantic Segmentation Models"".

We recognize there is an opportunity here to build a ""smart"" questionnaire based on responses to questions.

For the ones of you who don't have too much experience with machine learning but still want to play with deep dreams, you can try the account [@DeepDreamThis](https://twitter.com/DeepDreamThis) on Twitter. It will *deep dream* any image you'll tweet to it. There are few other online services which do that, but this is the first one which allows for some customisation.

In the text of your tweet you can change the style with one of the following parameters:

* -strokes:  maximises the layer *inception_3b/5x5_reduce*
* -flowers:  maximises the layer *inpcetion_4c/1x1*
* -vortices: maximises the layer *inception_4a/1x1*
* -wrinkles: maximises the layer *conv2/3x3*
* -waves: maximises the layer *conv2/3x3_reduce*
* -fluffy: maximises the layer *inception_3b/output*
* -glass: maximises the layer *inception_3a/3x3*

If you don't put anything, it will maximises the layer *inception_4c/output*, which is usually the one commonly used.

You can also tweak how many iteration you'll have (standard: 10), by adding:

* -heavy: 14 iterations
* -light: 6 iterations

and also changing the number of octaves used to find patterns in your deep dream (standard: 4):

* -deep: 6 octaves
* -shallow: 2 octaves

Loosely speaking, iterations determines how heavily your image is modified, and octaves determines the size of the patterns it will find.

You can also use -random to get some random effect, and -gif to get an animation.

I'd like scores to be computed in isolation on each ngram.  I can't rely on the greater context.

A very simple approach would be to have a list of many bigrams that Jim uses frequently and Bob uses infrequently in some training data.  If Jim used ""hello there"" 100 times in the training data, and Bob only 5 times, then in test data I could say with high confidence that ""hello there"" was said by Jim.

I've read a bit about smoothing and interpolation, but my uneducated guess is that those are more aimed at scenarios where you need to provide an answer all the time.  Maybe that's not even a real distinction.

By short ngrams I mean 2-4.  I don't think single words are reliable enough

Any tips?

Although I believe this game is actually solved, I think it would be a good learning exercise to write an ML program for this. Basically, liars dice is a turn based game where all players roll their dice while keeping them hidden (5 each at the start) and then go around making bets about the number of dice on the table (while only being able to see your own dice). Eg. ""three fours or four sixes"" Each player must either raise the bet or call the previous player a liar. When someone calls the previous player a liar, the hands are lifted and the player that was wrong (either the player who made the last bet or the player who called them a liar) must place one of their dice in the middle and out of play. The last player to still have some of their dice wins.

I am very much a beginner in the machine learning field so I need some help coming up with a learning structure. My initial thought was to use genetic algorithms along with recurrent neural networks. Basically the RNN would be fed each previous bet, the values of the dice belonging to it and the total number of dice on the table and would output the bet it should make or some signal for calling the person a liar. Initially, a large population of RNNs would be randomly created (say 100) then a series of games would be started containing (2-5 randomly selected RNNs). The RNNs would be given points for adhering to the rules (making bets higher than the previous ones) and for winning games. Then the next population would be bred using tournament ranking where the top ranked RNNs would have a better chance of being picked to breed.

I have a couple questions about this:

* First of all, is it possible to feed an RNN different types of information at once (eg. a possibly infinite vector of previous bets along with a fixed vector of dice and a fixed number of total dice) and how would I go about doing this?
* Secondly, would this method work in practice? I feel confident that this program could create RNNs that adhere to the rules of the game but I'm not sure how much strategy these RNNs can develop when they are not playing ""good"" competitors.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm a senior in college and will be sitting for Job interviews in a fortnight. I had completed a course in Machine Learning in college as well as Andrew NG's course on coursera (albeit partially) in the second year. During this period, I completed two decently good projects:

1) Active Learning based Sentence classifier of Scientific Papers
    - Query by committee sampling method was used to train an active learning classifier. It was implemented by writing a decision tree classifier to annotate these papers.
2) Time series based forecasting of product sales in a local super market.
	- The Naive bayes classification technique was used.

Due to a few reasons, I lost touch with the field of ML and haven't been very active in reading up on new research nor completing projects in this field.

I am finding it difficult to remember the logic I used while using these methodologies to complete my projects, hence I plan to do a quick overview of the relevant/most important ML algorithms and techniques. I have come up with this preliminary list of topics to cover in the next 14 days and I would appreciate it if anyone could direct me in the right direction. 

Techniques to read up on:
	
        I) Supervised Learning:
		a) Classification:
			1) Logistic regression
			2) Linear SVM and kernel SVM
			3) Random Forests
			4) Neural Networks
			5) Ensemble Methods: Bagging
			6) Naive Bayes
		b) Regression:
			1) Least Square Method

	II) Unsupervised:
		a) k-means clustering

	III) Reinforcement Learning

	IV) Dimensionality redution Techniques

I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Statistics. I have also taken three semesters of Computer Science courses, including a class about data structures and basic algorithms. As I look at graduate institutions doing research in Machine Learning, I find that many of them are located within Computer Science departments. From reading a few discussions here ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qb1jz/graduate_study_in_statistics_or_computer_science/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2cx4ca/applying_to_top_phd_programs_with_statistics/)), I think I may be more interested in those than the ones based in stats departments.

My coursework generally meets the prerequisites for PhD programs in Statistics (Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Calc-based stats, Real Analysis), but I am unsure what it takes to be qualified to study machine learning from a CS perspective.

Some institutions offer no information, while others say ""the equivalent of an undergraduate education in Computer Science,"" and few give specific requirements, which generally include Theory of Computation, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Programming Languages. I doubt that a course in operating systems is necessary to study machine learning, but I suppose it could be necessary for some other parts of a given program's curriculum.

I'm in process of learning about and experimenting with Deep Learning. I'm thinking about starting a for-fun project for my learning sake and hoping someone can tell me whether this would actually work.

This would be another image classifier. The use case is as follows:

1. A user visits a web application I've built (which fronts the neural net)
1. The user bulk uploads 1,000 or so photos (probably using FTP)
1. After upload, the user is presented with a list of all their photos
1. The user now can select 5 - 10 or so similar photos
1. The selections are passed to the neural net, and the neural net finds all photos within (and only within) the user's 1,000 or photos
1. The user now sees a filtered list of photos they uploaded based on the 5 - 10 similar photos they selected.

So let's say a user uploads 1,000 photos of car parts, and then they select 5 - 10 photos of just tires; their 1,000 photos would then be filtered to only show tires.

Or let's say I have 1,000 photos of clothing, and I select 5 - 10 photos of shirts; I would only see shirts from my 1,000 photos. OR, let's say I specifically select *red* shirts -- I would only see shirts that happen to be red.

I imagine the network would require a significant amount of pre-training based on ImageNet and other data. And then it would continue learning based on data uploaded by all users. I figure the same network would be used for all users.

Does this seem feasible using a Deep Convolutional neural network? Can a Deep Convolutional network be used to continually create multiple different classifications, per user, as described?",10,7,False,self,,,,,

I'm working for my university this summer attempting to analyze timbre of various instruments and play styles. The end goal is to find a way to *visually* separate a 'desirable' tone from a 'poor' tone using data from real time FFTs. We hope to be able to design an app for students that will allow a teacher to record sounds that are 'desirable', have them displayed as a region in some sort of 2 dimensional space, and then have the students attempt to match their tone to the teacher's by moving their own marker into that 'desirable' region by working on their technique. At the moment, we are trying to figure out which strategies we should be using in order to get the best spacial visualization for this purpose.

**Warning**: Neither I nor my co-worker have taken a course in linear algebra, statistics, programming, or machine learning (why they hired us, I'm not sure). We've done our best to learn about each of these topics from Google (as well as some other resources), but we certainly haven't mastered any of it. It's very possible I'm going to sound like an idiot at multiple points.

If you have any suggestions for any part of our process below, please let me know! So far, our process goes a little something like this:

**Record audio**: We asked our performers to play various scales in ways both 'good' and 'bad' in order to find patterns between 'good', 'pure', 'developed' tone and 'poor', 'elementary', 'muddled' tone. The best format we've found for doing so is in wav, 44.1khz, 16-bit, mono.

**Standardize length of audio**: I wrote some code to chop up all of the audio files into pieces of 2205 samples each (50 milliseconds). It seemed like most audio analysis tools lean more towards 20 milliseconds, but we thought that the FFT appeared to be losing too much resolution at that point and took it a step longer.

**Take FFTs**: We're using np.fft.rfft simply because it appeared to work best for our needs.

**Find the fundamental**: We had the most luck using a piece of code found [here](https://gist.github.com/endolith/255291). The autocorrelation method was the only one that gave us consistently reasonable results, so we settled on that one by default. If anyone has better suggestions, I'd certainly be open to trying them.

**Normalize the FFTs**: For each piece of audio, we divide the amplitudes by the max amplitude and the frequency data given by np.fft.rfftfreq by the fundamental in order to do away with differences in pitch and volume.

**Interpolate and stack**: We use scipy.interpolate.griddata to take all of the frequency and amplitude data and line it up with each other. Right now, we're just arbitrarily choosing one of the normalized frequency arrays as the basis for the rest, but I'm guessing there's a more fool-proof way to do this. If you know of one, please let me know.

**Interpret the data!**: At this point, we can visualize all of the FFTs directly by graphing them together (to see differences in harmonics between each instrument), or we can feed them into a PCA(principal component analysis) or LDA(linear discriminant analysis), both of which are taken from the scikit-learn library.

This last piece is where we need more help. Applying a PCA to the data reveals *some* differences between instruments, but timbre is a little too subtle to see any clear separation between our 'good' and 'bad' inputs. LDAs have been much more fruitful since we are able to specifically separate the data based on both instruments *and* type of timbre, but I'm getting worried that the separation is *too good* and may actually be misleading. When I input, for example, 'good' cello and 'bad' cello data, LDA returns only a single dimension with all of the 'good' on one side and all of the 'bad' on the other with next to zero mixing. I find it unreasonable that the separation between 'good' and 'bad' should be so distinct. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/FNXj3) are some examples.

I hope some of you with more experience in this area may be able to suggest some strategies that haven't popped up in our googling. I've begun taking a look at using MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) but as of yet, I haven't discovered a meaningful way to apply/visualize the data from this technique.

But the top layer has neurons for all kinds of things, right? There's a neuron that turns on for a cat face and one that turns on for german shepherds or whatever.

I have seen a number of papers that talk about accent classification.  What I want to do is along the same lines: given an audio clip is the speaker talking with accent A with greater than X% probability?

My approach thus far has been to break each of my labeled training clips into windows, construct a feature vector for each window, and train an SVM.  Then with another set of labeled training clips, I classify each window in each clip as being part of the accent or not, and then train for a threshold on the number of features in the clip labelled as being part of the accent.

The problem with this is rather obvious: given a window into a clip it is very likely that its classification is indeterminate (perhaps it's a pause, or a sound that doesn't leave much room for an accent to differentiate itself).  Also, an SVM doesn't really take into account what my goal is.  An SVM will do its best to differentiate between individual features in my two classes labeled ""yes"" or ""no"", but that isn't what I want--I want to be able to train a SVM that optimally differentiates between ""bags"" of features.  I have also read about using Gaussian Mixture Models for this sort of thing, but again, I am still worried that the large amount of common features will skew the model to be very sub-optimal.

I remember back to my introductory class a problem where we used a ""bag of words"" representation of emails to classify them as spam.  In that case, it was easy to find the features that should be ignored since it is just a question of counting the occurrence of a given word in both classes.  Obviously in this case it isn't so simple because the features are very high-dimensional.  I can try clustering my features regardless of their labels and then mapping my audio clips into a ""bag of words"" linear classification model where the feature vector is the number of windows that map to a given cluster for a clip.  I could also try to do something to reduce the dimensionality of my features before the clustering.  However, in both cases, I still am afraid that the indeterminate features will dilute things by a lot.

I followed the instructions in the thread and set up a nice Ubuntu VirtualBox VM running Torch7 and a LSTM RNN. However, it does it so damn slowly, due to being limited by my CPU through the VM and not being able to use my GPU. So my question is... how do I make it go faster?

**The options that I'm aware of:**

* Try to install Torch7 on Windows, to access CUDA with my gtx560 ti. Attempted this; it's heinously difficult and I've pretty much failed. One guy who's apparently done it responded to my email by saying, essentially, ""don't"". Failing that, install other software that can run on Windows and use CUDA, which can also do LSTM RNNs. Problem is, I don't know of any such software out there that fits those requirements.

* Try to get PCI Passthrough working for Ubuntu in Virtualbox. This is tricky, but at least there's explicit instructions (unlike Torch for Windows, which involves arcane handwaving and guesswork). The one failure point is the requirement for the motherboard, cpu, the Ubuntu kernel, the BIOS, (the pet dog, my neighbour...) to all be IOMMU compatible, which for an Intel cpu translates as having VT-d. Now... my i7-2600k has VT-x. But, no VT-d. The i7-2600 (which I didn't buy, because hey, the K must be better IN ALL WAYS than the non-K, right?) has both VT-d and VT-x. Goddamnit, Intel. 
Therefore, the only way I can do PCI Passthrough (as far as I know) is to get a CPU with VT-x. Ok, but these days (if I want to maintain same number of cores, etc.) that means something like an i7-4790k. It's 400 CAD and won't fit into my Asus P8P67 motherboard, so add another 150 CAD for a new one. And after all that, PCI Passthrough might even not work that great. Yeesh. I don't know if there's other virtualization software out there that's free/low cost and lets a GPU run CUDA through it, but I find it unlikely (since I've searched and not found any).

* Dual-boot Ubuntu. Probably the easiest option, but also the most annoying. I use Win7 as my daily OS, and there's plenty of stuff I can't do in Ubuntu that I can do in Win7. If I wanted to run training or sample a checkpoint file I'd have to be in Ubuntu, which is more annoying than being in Windows.

So ideally, I'd want to find a way of running Ubuntu through some sort of VM, on Win7 as the host, with it having access to my GPU for CUDA calculations. Or, find some software that can do RNNs on Windows.",34,7,False,self,,,,,

We've been having a debate on what the best way would be to teach a machine to play poker (not solve GTO like the alberta project but teach it to be proficient at the game).

I think the approach of having it play against itself and improving iteratively that way like the first checkers machine learning algorithm did is going to be far too inefficient with the complexity of no limit holdem. Another approach would be letting it learn from the hands that myself or my friend have played and draw conclusions from that, knowing that it will be drawing/learning from a base strategy of people who were winning players, so the assumption is that most of those plays are good plays.

That said, the issue we both have trouble with is how it would actually learn on it's own what is a good play or what is a bad play. There are many instances in poker where you can make a good play that leads to a bad result. Example:

You have a board of AKJT4 , you 'know' your opponent only has a Queen in this situation 5% of the time. There is 500 in the pot, and you both have 1000 left. You go all in, knowing he will fold 95% of the time and you will win 500 chips, or he will call 5% of the time and you will lose 1000 chips, giving you a net gain of +425 chips. You have 78 (nothing), and go all in. In this specific instance your opponent calls you and you lose, although in an overall strategy this is a good play.

So my question from our argument is, what ML approaches would be best for tackling this sort of problem and is it likely that the machine would be able to classify individual plays with such depth or would it simply say ""Over the 5M hands that I have seen, making this play in this scenario is associated with a higher winrate than any other play in this scenario""?


This is not something we're going to be implementing since at the moment it's beyond us but we were curious how the different ML algorithms actually approach this scenario when you can have an action that results in a positive result but is in reality a negative action (and vice versa). Is the solution just that with a large enough sample these things should be weeded out and their true value/worth established?

It's an algorithm that takes the titles of youtube videos and is supposed to output if the video is a lecture or course (1) or if it's something else (-1). In this example I use the index of a character in a string of all characters as input for each neuron. The input layer has 50 neurons so the text can't be over 50 characters.

I noticed that the amount of GPU memory and processing time needed for a net seems to scale faster than linearly with the number of cells per layer. I *think* it's quadratic because adjacent layers are densely connected; that is, each activation output from an LSTM unit on layer L links to the inputs of *every* LSTM unit on layer L+1. Thus a GPU with more memory and processing power is going to pay pretty limited dividends in terms of scaling the horizontal size of the network.

If I've got that right, I was wondering if anyone is aware of any example code or other pointers for how to implement sparsely connected LSTM layers -- where each LSTM unit in layer L connects to (say) exactly 256 LSTM units in layer L+1 (chosen randomly upon initialization), such that the GPU memory and computer power required to add another marginal LSTM unit to each layer is (much closer to) constant.

Does anyone know if that architecture or similar has been successful, or any pointers to implementing it in Torch? I think it probably works to some extent, because I found an oblique comment by Prof. Schmidhuber somewhere to the effect that sparse LSTMs work well, and I have this (quite possibly crackpot) theory that with enough training data, the sophistication of LSTM sequence predictors could grow with their parallel breadth without limit to the point where they could generate ideas and complete arguments rather than phrases and short isolated sentences.

In the tensor, not all the ""k"" experiments have all the ""n"" observations available. However, when the observation exists in an experiment, it is guaranteed that all the ""m"" continuous variables are present. It is expected that only a small number of 'm' variables (i.e. no more than 100) are needed to explain a 'p' variable. These 'p' variables are not expected to be completely independent from each other, and the classes can be quite unbalanced in some cases. Moreover, the ""k"" experiments are very different and each one provides information from a different perspective, so I would assume that flattening this X tensor will lead to loss of information.

In particular, I am interested in constructing a classification model that can explain the 'p' variables (or groups of these variables), and that is interpretable in terms of which variables enter that model, and therefore I am avoiding black-box methods. I would like to reach conclusions of the form ""The set {p_1, ... p_a} of variables from Y can be explained by variables {m_1, ... m_b}, which are more strongly represented on experiments {k_1, ..., k_c}"".

I've been having trouble on how to approach this problem. It looks to me that if X was just a matrix I could use Canonical Correlation Analysis.

Does that mean that a neural network which classifies different images has generic low-level processing in most of the early layers and image-specific information in the last one or two layers?

After reading a handful of papers/books, I was able to get a simple model built to classify [SMS messages](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) as either **spam** or **ham** using [Torch7](http://torch.ch).

I've seen quite a bit of discussion on RNNs/LSTMs, and am interested in learning a bit more about how they work. My current understanding is that RNNs are well suited for sequence data. The typical example being *given this sequence of letters, what's the next most likely letter?*. 

I'm interested in reframing my toy SMS problem in the context of an LSTM, but am having trouble understanding how RNNs/LSTMs are used for classification. For instance, how do you take an SMS message: 

&gt; Had your mobile 11 months or more? U R entitled to Update to the latest colour mobiles with camera for Free! Call The Mobile Update Co FREE on 08002986030

And convert it into a sequence? My current idea is as follows:

* RNN would take N inputs, where N is the number of characters I want to pass in at any given time.
* Chunk the SMS into several N length parts (e.g. N = 5 would result in chunks *Had y*, *ad yo*, 
*d you*, etc). That is, I would have a window of size N that I would slide down the message. 
* Each window would be passed into the RNN as input - these would serve as my sequences. 
* Whenever I get to the end of a message, if I don't have enough characters I simply fill in any empty slots with a null value.
* For each window in a message, I'd use the label for the overall message as my target.
* The network would have two outputs: One for spam, and one for ham.

I feel like a poor understanding on my part is resulting in an over complication.

For a year or so, a physics professor and I have worked together to develop a thesis centered around the mechanical application of neural networks into real-world robotics (basically, we came up with a system that reworks the dynamics of motion and utilizes a self functioning, semi-aware, neural network to command a robotic device). We've devised an intricate series of differential equations and PID-esque formulas and algorithms to back up our research.

When it comes to Neural Networks, I nearly understand all theoretical information (I've read a lot and documented myself) but am not sure how to start applying this knowledge into real world, live, programming. Was wondering if anybody could provide some sources for learning material.

I am stuck on a small problem at my internship. Any recommendation/advice would be very helpful.

I trained a MultiLayerPerceptron (weka) with inputs (let's call them a, b, c, d) with ouputs (power, time). Now, with a hard constraint (i.e. power &lt; 3000W) and soft constraint (decrease time as much as possible), I need to find inputs (a, b, c, d). 

Here is my approach: 
Using a genetic algorithm I can go through the search space (10^7) and find the inputs(a, b, c, d) that would fit my constraints.

Few Questions:
Anyone know good genetic algorithms or greedy algorithms APIs where I can set my hard and soft constraints?
Any other way of approaching this problem?",1,0,False,self,,,,,

In the past , for tasks such as this, i have used randomized hill climbing ; where the cost function or grading scale is simply assigning points to different accomplishments (how long did you survive,how much food did you find, were you eaten,etc) and searching for the best agent.

Further, a ""game over"" will be triggered whenever account balance drops below some threshold.

In addition to price and volume data, the charts will probably include indicators (rendered into the charts), as well.

Sorry for the silly/noob question, I'm a french software engineer and I'd like to learn about self-driving vehicles (mostly cars).

I've started to read about machine learning, and I'm really excited! I've studied good basics of mechanics and electrics, and I'm wondering **which other fields I should study**, like maybe :

- embedded systems
- control theory
- haptics
- ...


If I'm confused it's both because:

- I lack of vocabulary (there's a lot to know about this, and I'm french, voil!)
- I'm not sure what is really useful, like maybe control theory is useless with machine learning ?

I would like to ask your opinions about how ethical do you think that it is to use such systems in the borders. I mean that such systems rely in the same ethical area as the current laws about immigration, since they are only a technical contribution to the border infrastructure. However, although I understand the concerns for extra tight security at the borders wouldn't it be a bit too far in the ethical sense to adopt so many sources of identification in order to prevent illegal immigrants from entering ? (lets put aside the cases of human trafficking, drugs being sold illegaly at the borders...). Isn't it too cruel to consider people as smuggled in case they just simply want to come to the country to work but not having the means to do it in a legal manner ?What is more if such systems are adopted more and more wouldn't they cause illegal immigrants choose more dangerous options (for them) in order to enter the country ?

This is because character a or [0.1] is of class 1 in word x, but is of class 4 in word y. The same input can not have two classes, right?

However, how else do I do this? The reason I am training one character at a time is so that similar words result in similar classes; for example read and reading. Another reason I am training one character at a time is because I don't know how many words there will be in a input so I have one input neuron. I input each character and the lstm then takes in the whole sequence of vectors with the same class, which is also the last character's class.

Is there a way to do this properly? Meaning train a deep-network one character at a time with the ideal output pertaining to the sequence of characters / vectors and with it converging and completing training?

Highly likely for us we be starting out with batch processing and having predictions reside in a BI database server, so we will port our Python development code to a production server and have it run there (in this case, a ""production server"" would be something with a little more attention to backups and redundancy, maybe virtualized so the sysadmin crew can more easily allocate resources or move it around on hosts if needed, locked down from a deployment aspects, etc). 

Not sure if we would need anything beyond crontab for job scheduling...we might as processes become bigger or involved (multi-step) or need better redundancy. 

We'll be using Git for source control and deployment.

Haven't settled on anything from a visualization standpoint yet. 

If/when we have anything closer to an app or a management more real-time predictive capabilities, of course we'll be looking at those particular aspects of a system (and language) to manage that more effectively.

We then go on to measure the performance of our algorithm by making an ROC curve of false positives verses false negatives, or just state the percentage correct.

However, this is not necessarily correct to assume that all the labels in the test set are correct. If the test set isn't vetted well enough, it's reasonable to assume some small percentage of the labels were assigned by mistake. And even further, on some problems, human performance on the test set is not even close to 100%. If people can't even be correct close to all the time, it seems foolish to assume we've got all the labels in the test set correct.

Also, for a given example, maybe there isn't a label in the dictionary of labels that accurately corresponds to the example. What if (for example) somehow someone drew a smiley and it slipped into a dataset like MNIST on accident? In that case no label would be a correct label.

So assuming we don't have a perfectly labeled test set, how can we mathematically adjust our performance calculations or interpret them to account for that? If we had a test set with 5% wrong labels (maybe that's extreme, but imagine it), there's probably not really any difference in the performance of an algorithm that got 97% and one that got 99.5%. What are good ways of figuring out what the true accuracy of our labels are? Human evaluation? Multiple human evaluations? If we find incorrect labels in our test set, should we remove the examples and test again?

Of course all these questions probably depend on what problems and datasets your have, how they were constructed, how things are being evaluated... etc. But I'm looking for other people's opinions and anecdotes for what they've done, and other people's thought process on the matter.",1,4,False,self,,,,,

fast-rcnn - http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083

faster-rcnn: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497

The fast r-cnn code was released pretty quickly, but was an absolute nightmare to make a product out of. After some development I was finally able to train fast r-cnn code on my own datasets, and sure enough it is super fast and pretty accurate. My advice is unless you are a masterful python-ist (and even if you are), set aside some time to really understand and look at his code. In many places it's just bad and you'll have to rewrite it to work with it for your own datasets. All that said, great idea, and great algorithm.

faster r-cnn just says ""The code will be released"" in the abstract. Instead of waiting for another repo that may also be cryptic and obfuscated, I was just gonna start coding it up myself from my initial edits of fast r-cnn so I can keep the papers flowing.

A questions about it I'd love to hear peoples input on though:

1. Did you find Girshick's code hard to mutate so you could use it or was it just me?

1. At what point do we need to say that test speed isn't worth it for all the extra training? Fast r-cnn only has to be trained once, but the procedure for the faster r-cnn looks like you need to train/finetune 4 different nets? (1- Finetune an imagenet model for objectntness with anchor points on the new dataset, 2- Train a fast r-cnn on the new dataset using the regions proposed by (1), 3- Use the conv layers from (2) on the first model and fix the conv layers, to finetune the fully connected layers, and 4- Finetune the fc layers of (2) with the regions proposed in (3)). After training 4 networks, they can use 300 regions, and go end to end detection in about .2 seconds. In an upcoming paper (probably arxiv), I have found that you can do end to end detection in &lt; 1 second for around 2250 regions).

I have several completely different software components that are producing scores for certain candidate solutions.

Now, setting aside the technical details of what is the problem that I want to solve and how the several software components (riddled with complex heuristics) are obtaining the scores, I would like to know how to combine these (potentially 0..1 normalized) scores.

The goal is to have one final summarizing score, the candidate solution that get the maximum score will be chosen.

One possibility is averaging, another might be multiplying, but I wonder: aren't there any smarter techniques?

The scores might be interpreted as probabilities if they are normalized in the interval [0,1].

The model is a black-box because for any particular parameter set, I'm running simulations of neural circuitry (with noise), and I'm then applying a predictive model on the output of the simulation to measure a latent feature in the artificial data. 

The error of this black-box is then the discrepancy between the estimated latent feature from the simulated data (generated via a candidate parameter set), and then a target which I can define manually. Thus my main aim is to identify the parameter sets which generate the latent feature which match my target as closely as possible.

The main issue with this is that certain values of parameters produce simulations from which it is not possible to estimate that latent feature I mentioned (it requires inverting a matrix). As a result, the prediction error is undefined at that parameter value. Consequently the prediction error function has points that are undefined.

My question is, are there any sensible approaches to dealing with this situation? Currently I just set the error to be artificially large (say, 10000) and hope that the optimisation algorithm learns to ignore those parts of the parameter space. However I intuitively feel that the value of this artificial error could make a huge difference, and I've no idea what kind of value would be sensible.

I would appreciate any help on this. Thank you very much",3,1,False,self,,,,,

How would you go about implementing such a system? What models/approaches would you use?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

And why is it best to select traits from the two best, as opposed to say.. 50% from the best, 30% from the second best, 20% from the third best, or some other multiple parent solution?

Also could a neural network (that has already been 'trained') be trained to respond to new input, by introducing the new input into the system with a low weighting so that it can slowly integrate into the system? For example if you had a path finding AI, adding in an extra 'eye' input so it can see another angle.",21,16,False,self,,,,,
