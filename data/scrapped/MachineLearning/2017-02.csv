1. How many of the insights about hyperparameters in a supervised setting for deep learning apply to deep RL? For instance, should I just make the batch size as large as possible to fill up my GPU as I would do for supervised learning or can that have negative effects on the RL?

2. What hyperparameters would you normally examine first when a specific RL application isn't working? % chance of taking random action, learning rate or something different?

3. RL training seems to be very noisy with many different metrics measuring performance. What advice can you give on how best to see if your model is doing well? What metrics do you normally focus the most on?

Example at time = 8 with periods 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. t is divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 8, so at this time step these modules will be updated, and are updated as a function of *all* modules from the previous time step. However module 16 will flow through untouched, because it's not its time to tick.

Side note: If you're not yet familiar, go straight to Figure 2, which is very clear. (Figure 1 reminds me of something in On Writing by Stephen King... sometimes it's hard ""to kill your darlings"" upon revision. I think Figure 1 was one such darling :).)

I have implemented clockwork RNNs in TensorFlow, as no vetted versions exist yet. (See https://github.com/tensorflow/models/pull/198)

I have tested it in many environments (copy problem, addition problem, flattened MNIST), and it is *significantly* outperformed by other RNN architectures in all cases (where the number of free parameters in all models are kept as close as possible).

Have others experimented much with this architecture? I'm wondering if anyone has had a different experience.

From one perspective, I could of course have a bug in my code, but I will mention that I reproduced the paper's toy example of using extremely few parameters and memorizing a short clip of music, and in this strange setting it does indeed outperform LSTM.

One of my colleagues asked me to retrain a network using only the samples from the training base that are not recognized. Within an original database of 250K, we are talking about retraining with 1.4 K.

It seems like an interesting idea, similar to how we learn by repetition of failures until success. But I am kind of afraid of the result on a CNN.

Abstract

Despite partial success, communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing, a state called complete locked-in state (CLIS). Based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric braincomputer interface (BCI) communication attempts in CLIS, we here report BCI communication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an implicit attentional processing procedure. Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS without reliable means of communicationlearned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a yes or no thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. Three patients completed more than 46 sessions spread over several weeks, and one patient (patient W) completed 20 sessions. Online fNIRS classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine (SVM) resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70%. Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a yes or no response. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior communication performance, probably because of decreased vigilance and attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS, these positive results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in states, at least for ALS.

I have a 1M sample database of signals (no labels) containing a variety of freq phenomena seen in their spectr0-gr@ms, with enough repetition of phenomena for about a dozen consistent categories to appear upon inspection. I would like to cluster these samples well enough so that I can label per cluster, but I fail to achieve this result.

The spectr0-gr@ms are converted into small images containing enough detail. The typical features seen are fairly simplistic, like a narrow line, a collection of narrow lines, broad line(s) and stroking and dotting. It is more complex than MNIST, for example, because the categories are not clearly defined as there is much more variation that merges potential categories.

I have used dense and convolutional AE from 20 to 2 encoding dimensions with a large variety of sensible architectures that manage to reconstruct very well, even with 3 encoding dimensions. I follow a 8D AE with tsne as a necessity for agglomerative clustering to produce sensible clusterings, as there is still a curse of dimensionality preventing  good clustering at say 5 or more dimensions.

I have used engineered features that perform much better at showing wider variation of samples in the clustered result than with AE+tsne. I have played around with reducing the AE neuron capacity to prevent overfitting to capture just the coarse sample characteristics, but with no real improvement, the engineered features do much better but they still don't give adequate clusters.

I believe it is possible to use neural networks in an unsupervised setting to avoid feature engineering and to produce a good variety of image clusters, but my poor and limited attempts thus far has not produced this outcome.

I know there are very sophisticated unsupervised feature extraction + clustering algorithms out there, but I just want to be able to use well known components like Deep AE and tsne, etc. to solve this. Any advice is welcome, thanks.",6,4,False,self,,,,,

My intuition is that local hardware is more common as that has lower TCO if you can keep utilization high, OTOH you don't get the flexibility to scale up and down and have more operational costs.
Another issue that comes to mind is managing data itself - just moving very large data sets to the cloud can be time consuming, and then there may be compliance issues with off-site data, worries about security etc. 

Clearly, there are trade-offs between these two approaches, so I guess I'm really asking - does anyone have experience of how these approaches play out in practice, outside of an individual/academic setting? Is there any particular factor that ends up dominating in most situations that makes one approach clearly superior?

This algorithm was additionally found to be attain performance that was not statistically different from deep learning approaches in another work (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06455v4.pdf). 

The general gist of BOSS is to compute a Symbolic Fourier Approximation (string based representation of the first few Fourier coefficients) over sliding windows of the series and to use the distribution of those symbolic approximations (in terms of a histogram) as a low dimensional representation of the data. 

That said, I have only recently started working with time series data and have been simultaneously been trying to catch up with the literature in signal processing and in time series classification. As of right now, it seems to me that there is some disconnect in the methods considered by the two communities. For instance, to me, BOSS seems like a somewhat roundabout way of recreating wavelet theory, which allows for an efficient representation over both the time and frequency domain. Given that wavelet theory is somewhat mature and ubiquitous in the signal processing community, it seems odd to me that is not considered as a candidate method for representing time series in these review papers from the time series communities.

Overall, I am interested in why there seems to be some sort of disconnect in the methods considered between the signal processing and the time series communities. Additionally, if anyone has any anecdotal evidence as to the performance differences between wavelet based feature extraction and methods such as BOSS, that would be immensely helpful for my personal research.",5,19,False,self,,,,,

Most papers say, that one could download the Dataset from the author's Homepage (Luca Marchesotti), however, this page ist down. Scraping the images from DPChallenge.com does not work, I got blocked after I scraped some 200 Pictures... 
Does anybody have the dataset or knows where I could get it? This seems to be the dataset everyone uses in this field.

In MDP, the value of a state is total expected reward of the optimal policy. That's great if (1) the Markov assumption is acceptable for you, and if (2) the states and actions are well defined.

When transferring knowledge from a human to a robot, you can't easily map the human's actions to that of the robot (i.e. the correspondence problem). So instead, we're working on a **value function** using a ranking approach. 

In order to validate our algorithm's performance, we need your help!

I like the framework of iteratively improving a final representation and the attention model, compared to RNN sequential decoders.

My plan seems straightforward:

* Input is a matrix, where each row is a static word embedding, normalized to (0,1)

* For read and write attention, the convolutional receptive field will be the full width of the input matrix (unnecessary?)

* Output is a matrix, convert each row to a word for a sequence of words

The final representation is a matrix of positive continuous real values, with each row representing one word in the output sequence. Each row gets multiplied by an output projection matrix, to result in a sequence of vectors where each represents the output distribution over the vocab. Will it suffice to let 
    
    loss = softmax_cross_entropy() + latent_loss()?

I built this tool for 4 main reasons:

1. The training phase of a ML model is almost the same for every model of a certain type
2. When we train a model we usually want to monitor some metrics and visualize some result
3. During the training phase, we want to save the best model, where the goodness of the model is given by its performance on the evaluation set, measured by some metric
4. There's a lack of engineering in the ML field

I think that this last point requires an explanation: usually, researcher builds their models and input sources as they want.
Even if different researchers uses Tensorflow, everyone follows it's own pattern:

* someone writes a huge python file with everything inside
* someone writes different scripts with different names and write somewhere how to execute it
* someone refers to some dataset that's not provided with the code and who want's to reproduce the experiment must waste its time looking for this dataset on the internet.

**In short**:  it's hard to reproduce the experiments, running the code, obtain and preprocess the datasets.
As a consequence, there are lots of people that are *wasting their time* reimplementing stuff.

DTB aim is (also) to standardize the definition of the input sources (how to obtain a dataset, how to preprocess it, how to split in train/evaluation/test) and the training procedures.
Moreover, even models should be standardized: if I'm defining a classifier I must implement a Classifier interface; if I'm defining a Regressor I must implement another interface, and so on...

I invite you to browse the [models](https://github.com/galeone/dynamic-training-bench/tree/master/models) and [inputs](https://github.com/galeone/dynamic-training-bench/tree/master/inputs) folders to find out how I defined the interfaces and their implementations.

Clearly, there's still a lot of work to do. There are lots of datasets that can be implemented, tests to do, interfaces to define and implement and so on... Moreover, even the organization of the train.py and evaluate.py file can be improved, maybe creating an interface `TrainProcess` and it's specializations like `TrainClassifier`, `TrainRegressor`, ...

I aim to be super high-level and 101, so this is for newbies and unconfidents. 

One goal of the podcast is to be a syllabus, where in each episode I recommend ""required readings"" resources - books/textbooks/courses/etc that I've boiled down from the most common recommendations from around the web. So anyone asking ""which maths should I learn? which textbooks would you recommend? which language is best?"" - this is for you.

Is anyone here working in this area? Have you been more successful, and if so how?

My most successful approach to this problem looks as follows.

Training data:
44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono audio

Input:
65-3500Hz spectrogram with a 4096 FT window size, 40ms step, and a logarithmic scale for the amplitudes. Rather than having the amplitudes in the value dimension I have created a new third dimension with 15 elements that holds the amplitudes. The value dimension is unused and contains only 0 or 1. The reason for moving the amplitudes from the value dimension is that I think the filters/neurons have poor expressive power on that dimension.

Normalization is done per spectrum rather than over the entire spectrogram to make it easier to detect amplitude patterns over frequencies (but harder over time).

Layer 1:
360ms long filters that are moved only along the time axis. ReLU activation function. The thinking is that these filters will extract the timbre features. More layers can be added on top of this one to catch temporal features.

Optimizer: tensorflow.train.AdamOptimizer(1e-4)

I'm working with voice separation/fingerprinting from short (2.5s) voice samples which requires good timbre (and pitch) perception. The human performance on this task ~98% success rate and I'm only getting a 53.3% success rate with the approach described above. By scaling up the network and adding more training data I could probably get the success rate up to around 70% but that's still nowhere near human performance.

A detailed description of my project, code, training data, and trained networks can be found at the link below.

http://pytt3.blogspot.se/2016/12/better-voice-recognition.html

Update 20170303:

I have rewritten pretty much everything in my project except the audio perception parts (the blog post have been updated) and the results have improved a bit. I now have a success rate of 94.6% on the training data and 80.7% on the test data. At the link below you can see the network labeling previously unheard voices. Still nowhere near human performance, but maybe it is reachable with some upscaling.

  2) https://jaan.io/what-is-variational-autoencoder-vae-tutorial/

1. states the following [and has positive losses]:

            reconstr_loss = \
            -tf.reduce_sum(self.x * tf.log(1e-10 + self.x_reconstr_mean)
                           + (1-self.x) * tf.log(1e-10 + 1 - self.x_reconstr_mean),
                           1)
        # 2.) The latent loss, which is defined as the Kullback Leibler divergence 
        ##    between the distribution in latent space induced by the encoder on 
        #     the data and some prior. This acts as a kind of regularizer.
        #     This can be interpreted as the number of ""nats"" required
        #     for transmitting the the latent space distribution given
        #     the prior.
        latent_loss = -0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(1 + self.z_log_sigma_sq 
                                           - tf.square(self.z_mean) 
                                           - tf.exp(self.z_log_sigma_sq), 1)
        self.cost = tf.reduce_mean(reconstr_loss + latent_loss)

2. has errors that go from negative error --&gt; positive : i.e. maximization. 

        prior_predictive_inp = distributions.Bernoulli(logits=p_x_given_z_logits)
        prior_predictive_inp_sample = prior_predictive_inp.sample()

        # Build the evidence lower bound (ELBO) or the negative loss
        kl = tf.reduce_sum(distributions.kl(q_z.distribution, p_z), 1)
        expected_log_likelihood = tf.reduce_sum(p_x_given_z.log_pmf(x),
                           [1, 2, 3])
        elbo = tf.reduce_sum(expected_log_likelihood - kl, 0)
        optimizer = tf.train.RMSPropOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
        train_op = optimizer.minimize(-elbo)




Which one of the two is correct?

If I worked it out correctly then the ELBO that we maximize is:

    log p(x) - KL[ Q(Z | X) || P(Z | X) ] = E_{z ~ Q(Z | X)} [log p(x|z)] - KL [ Q(Z | X) || P(Z) ] 

Since we cant compute `- KL[ Q(Z | X) || P(Z | X) ] ` we drop it expecting it to be ~0 and work with the RHS. Since we want to maximize the log likelihood we would equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood:

    max { log p(x) } = min { -log p(x) }= min { - E_{z ~ Q(Z | X)} [log p(x|z)] + KL [ Q(Z | X) || P(Z) ]  }

So should we be seeing a minimization of the KL term and a maximization of the expectation? thus if the error is dominated by the reconstruction process then the total error should be negative most of the time?",9,3,False,self,,,,,

I'm tasked with looking at the options for buying hardware to train convolutional neural networks. I'm a software developer in a research department at a hospital, and my ML experience starts at a ML course in my master and using an optimiser for my thesis, and ends with me reading [Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.](http://cs231n.github.io/). As for selecting hardware experience: I bought a not-of-the-shelf-gaming-computer about 10 years ago.
I have come across these very helpfull blogposts of [Tim Dettmers](http://timdettmers.com/2015/03/09/deep-learning-hardware-guide/) and [Roelof Pieters](http://graphific.github.io/posts/building-a-deep-learning-dream-machine/), and with these I made several profiles for options, ranging from cheap to expensive. I want to present this to my not very tech-savy boss in clear numbers (performance factor), for easy comparison, just like Tim Dettmers did [here](http://timdettmers.com/2014/08/14/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) (Titan X Pascal = 0.7 GTX 1080 = 0.55 GTX 1070 (...)). Currently I have this:

Name|Price|perf.|perf/price
:--|:--|:--|:--|
NVIDIA DGX-1|130000|25|0.192
4x titan X|8300|1|0.120
2x tital X|4900|0.55|0.112
4x 1070|3500|0.5|0.142
2x 1070|2200|0.27|0.122k
1x 1070|1700|0.14|0.082
buy a gpu|200|?|?
Current state|0|?|--

The performance estimates of the titan X and GT 1070 systems are based on Tims numbers, but i have trouble estimating a comparison to the current system. The rest of the hardware of the systems is compatible with the cards given tims and roelofs guidelines, and take an i7 and i5 processor respectively. Currently we own several year old [dell optiplex 9020 minitower](http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell-OptiPlex-9020-spec-sheet_Final_V2_G13001038.pdf) (notably, 1x 16pin PCIe 1, 12GB ram, 4th gen i5 cpu).

Some other details that might be relevant maybe. Well be using 3d CT data (grayscaled) of bones, dimensions are of the order 50x50x250, probably / maybe we'll process these as images. We have about 100 to 200 of these images, but data augmentation is planned. The plan is to use Theano with Lasagna, since involved people have experience with this.

Given this, I have several questions 1) How much better will the current system perform training convolutional neural networks after I add a GPU, 2) What kind of gpu will I be looking at? and 2) How will this system, including the gpu, compare performance wise, to any other system in my list?, assuming that the GPU is the computational bottleneck here. Any other remarks or suggestions are very welcome too.

The best DCNNs from years past perform a centering and normalization step on input images by subtracting either 1.) a mean image map, 2.) a mean channel vector, or 3.) a mean pixel value.  These normalizations on the input data have been shown (Wiesler &amp; Ney) to help converge faster and was the driving insight behind performing this normalization at each layer of the network.  Instead of pre-computing the mean and variance for each layer across an entire dataset, batch normalization approximates this by learning these values from seeing the mini-batches during training.

This is at the heart of my question: why perform dataset centering and normalization when batch normalization is designed for exactly this purpose?  Will batch normalization learn the ideal mean and variance values for the image dataset without having to pre-compute it or guess what the optimal value would be?

It can be a pain to pre-compute and carry around these additional centering and normalization values, why not integrate them directly into the model and learn them from scratch?  At the very least, why not simply initialize the input batch normalization layer from these pre-computed mean and variances and let back-propagation tease out the optimal value?",17,14,False,self,,,,,

For simple examples where the weak classifiers can fit the actual training set correctly it will correctly converge to the desired result, but for more complex examples, such as true positives in a circle while only having linear weak classifiers it spirals out of control after a few iterations by focusing too heavily on certain samples in such a way that it starts to misclassify the parts that were once classified correctly.

You can see a demo here: https://drake7707.github.io/adaboost-example/ (might not work in all browsers due to the use of ES6 Promise but it does in Firefox and Chrome), you can find the full source code in a github repo if you're interested: https://github.com/drake7707/adaboost-example

While I understand that the quality of the weak classifiers is important (if there is no linear combination of classifiers that can get near the labelled training set it's impossible to solve). However I don't understand why it degrades after a number iterations. I remember reading the error rate should decrease exponentially until a minimum is reached, as is the case with the '2D - Random split with axis aligned classifiers' example, well at least until it 'overfits' on the sample weights.

Am I trying to solve certain examples that are impossible to solve with linear weak classifers with adaboost?

As a pretty naive benchmark method, I binned the output interval and encoded the continuous truth values as one-hot vector transforming the regression into a classification problem. Surprisingly to me, this simple methods achieves a similar performance as the mixture model.

With the first approach you would stop when you have finished K beams but this might be really bad.

Also, what can I do on my own to have a stronger application? I'm not sure any professor in my university (not North America or europe) does Machine Learning research. A lot of people recommend having lots of publications out if you want any chance to be at the top 10 universities.

I'm finding the terminology quite confusing, and is having a hard time reading the code and figuring out. The equations in the thesis has separate equations for the input, forget and output gates, but in the ExportedData file, there's just a few vectors containing weights. I can see a multiple of 4 in certain weights, but am still having a tough time tracking which weights go where. I'd be grateful if someone can lend a hand. Thanks.

I wanted to know your opinion on this paper. After a couple of readings, this seems to be very similar to Deep Q-learning, except for the fact that rewards are replaced with 'measurements', which are essentially surrogates for the 'true reward'. 

During test time, the goals are formulated in terms of some required change in measurement and the current best action is chosen in a greedy fashion.

Similarities:

* Experience replay is gathered similar to DQN
* An L2 loss between expected function approximator value and experienced value is computed for optimization
* Follows an epsilon-greedy behavior strategy during training
* Eval time uses an argmax over current actions to choose the best action

Differences:

* Well, it isn't exactly SARSA or Q-learning in its objective. The function approximator tries to predict the change in measurements during training.

What is the reason this works better than DQN? This method doesn't bootstrap like DQN, and looks into more of the future while training ""latest three time steps contribute to the objective function"". Can DQN be modified subtly to be just as good?

Have I missed out on some nuances? Any other insights? Thanks.",5,17,False,self,,,,,

I'm the author of [gorgonia](https://github.com/chewxy/gorgonia), which is a graph computation library in vein of Theano/TensorFlow written in Go. And I'm happy to announce that Gorgonia now supports CUDA Ops (well, rudimentary ones).

# The Ask #

1. Play with Gorgonia - build neural networks in it. Write K-means algorithms, SVM algorithms (well, this is more the `tensor` package)! They say all bugs are shallow given enough eyeballs. I'd like the bugs in Gorgonia to be found and fixed.
2. I need help with CUDA, and its kernels. Write more CUDA kernels. If possible, use cuDNN. Contributors welcome. My goal is having a CUDA kernel for every Op in Gorgonia.
3. I need help with distributed computing. Distributed gradient descent is very very difficult to get right. And  difficult to test. 
4. Implement papers in Gorgonia! Well, I can hope. Every academic institution has their own framework. And those who don't, use TF/Theano. 
5. Test allthethings! My goal is for Gorgonia to hit 90% test coverage.  Right now it's at 75%. A big concern for me is larger data sets. The datasets I use in my daily work are about 300k - 1.2M elements in a matrix/tensor... so they're quite small. I need to think of things such as when the data cannot fit in memory and the like.
6. Help write documentation for Gorgonia. At the past 2 Go meetups I've been to, I've been told that Gorgonia has a number of features (such as that Gorgonia comes with a bunch of gradient descent optimizers) that without digging further, would go unnoticed. There is currently an [open issue](https://github.com/chewxy/gorgonia/issues/80) with regards to this. Pull requests are welcome.

# FAQ #

1. **Yet Another Deep Learning Library?** Yes. Sadly. There has been an explosion of deep learning libraries, but not one for Go. Furthermore, Gorgonia works at a much lower level than most deep learning libraries. 
2. **Why?** The main reason why I wrote Gorgonia was mainly because a few years ago, installing and deploying Theano was a pain in the ass. With Go it was easy - compile into a single executable binary, and run. I wrote more about the reasons [here](https://blog.chewxy.com/2016/09/19/gorgonia/) and [here](https://github.com/chewxy/gorgonia#why-use-gorgonia). Also, Go is a really nice language to use. 
3. **X operation is not supported!** Gorgonia was written such that it is easy to add ops. However, if you do write a convolution op or `im2col` and/or `col2im`, please do send a PR - that's been on my TODO list for years. 
4. **How does Gorgonia compare to Tensorflow?**  For the operations I use Gorgonia for (generally NLP stuff -  dependency parsing, word vectors, attention mechanisms etc), the speeds are comparable.

A trick that I've seen is that people maintain the RNN's hidden state across minibatches for pieces belonging to the same underlying sequence, instead of doing the usual thing and just setting the first hidden state to zeroes for every minibatch.

What are your main concerns or delights with both libraries?

I never made a switch from Torch7 to Tensorflow. I played around with Tensorflow but I always found Torch7 more intuitive (maybe I didn't play around enough!). I also had a tip that Pytorch was on the way, so decided I would wait for that.

After a few weeks using Pytorch, I don't think I'll be moving to Tensorflow any time soon, at least for my passion projects. It's ridiculously simple to write custom modules in Pytorch, and the dynamic graph construction is giving me so many ideas for things that previously would've been achieved by late-night hacks (and possibly put on the wait list). I think Pytorch is an incredible toolset for a machine learning developer. I realise that the wealth of community resources is much stronger for Tensorflow, but when working on novel projects (instead of re-coding known architectures or reading tutorials) this isn't always much help.

As training examples, I can just extract short subsequences from a stream recording, that contain the pattern.
But how do I evaluate it's performance on an actual stream?

Lets assume, that I'm trying to detect some kind of motion in body worn sensors.
I have a classifier that predicts true or false for a input sequence of length X.
The classifier would try to detect an event after every new sensor reading.
If I know when the motion was executed, how do I define a true positive? There has to be some kind of tolerance range.
What do I do, if my classifier says true for two successive sequences? Both TP, one TP one FP?
There are a lot of problems like this and I have not found guidelines and a lot of papers seem to not really care about this problem.

Is there any similar alternative data sets for deep reinforcement learning? So far the simplest environment I find was OpenAI's GYM cart-pole environment using only state values and rewards. But even that still takes a longer time(more than an hour) to converge to a solution in a simple DQN.


Is there any other simpler alternative toy environments (Python) where I can implement RL networks such as DQN easily and fast.
