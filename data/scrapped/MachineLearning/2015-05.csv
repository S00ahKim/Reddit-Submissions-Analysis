Let's say I have 3 million emails and I have a hypothesis that 1% of them are spam. So, I expect 30,000 of these 3 million emails to be spam but I don't know which ones.

Now, lets say I randomly choose 1 million of these emails and label them using a classifier I've trained. My classifier predicts that 40,000 of these 1 million are spam. I go review those 40,000 and find that only 10,000 of them are actually spam.

So, my precision is 10,000 out of 40,000 or 25%.

Now, let's say I go review those 3 million emails manually and find that my initial guess is correct and 30,000 of them actually are spam.

Can I make any guesses about what the precision of my classifier would be given another set of email with different distribution? Say 50% spam? 20% spam?

On one hand, it seems like precision says nothing except how my classifier did on this particular data set. But, on the other hand, it seems that if my classifier has a precision of 25% on a data set that was only 1% spam then surely it will do better on a data set that is 50% spam!

I want an error estimate along with the prediction (e.g. predict(X) --&gt; 2.5 +- 0.5).  I've combed through the documentation and cannot find any reference to this feature.  Is this possible with the tools above?  Other tools?  Is it even common or clearly defined?

I have implemented a simple decision tree on my own primarily to learn how they work and behave.  My intuition is to use the RMS of the values in the leaves to estimate the error of that leaf.  This seems to produce results that are consistent with being correct (i.e. my pull distribution is unit normal).  But my code is very simple and cannot match the performance of much more mature implementations (like forests and fancier splitting).

I would prefer not to use my custom code for this purpose and instead take a best practices approach.  Thoughts?  Did I miss something obvious?

I am stuck with this problem with a perceptron and really need advice. Everything I've googled so far didn't give me a clear answer, although this problem seems to be not completely uncommon.

I checked the code several times and also back propagation (BP) itself works just fine. But something weird happens in batch learning.

A snippet looks like this basically:

    weights = weights_old
    
    weight_deltas_sum = 0

    for I = 1:number of patterns
    
    [neuron_outputs, weighted_sums] = perceptron ( pattern_input(I), weights_old, ... )
    
    weight_deltas = backpropagaition( neuron_outputs, weighted_sums, ... ) 
    
    weight_deltas_sum = weight_deltas_sum + weight_deltas
    
    end;
    
    weights = weights_old + weight_deltas_sum 

The result that I get doing simple scalar function approximation looks like this:

An issue I foresee would be handling words that I don't have a sample of. For instance, if I don't have a clip of the person saying ""banana"" but in my mind I can imagine a plausible sound for the word in their voice. How could I go about generating that ""plausible sound""?    

I imagine that in addition to developing a map of words that have an available transcription, I would also need to construct a mapping between specific letters (or combinations of letters) and a phonetic sample for that sub-word element so I can generate new words (like banana).    

I would appreciate any guidance, links, terminology, or papers which might be relevant that I should investigate.

&gt; Why so awfully deep?

&gt; Recent ImageNet CNN architectures such as GoogLeNet, NIN, and VGG's net are usually really deep, having 10-20 convolutional layers. I can't help but ask: why so deep?

&gt; When I think about a conv layer, I think about composition. That is, a conv filter composes multiple ""parts"" into a ""whole"". In the early conv layers (1-3) this is clearly true. In the later layers it's less clear what is going on.

&gt; My hypothesis is that in the later convs the composition transits from ""hierarchical"" to ""combinatorial. That is, they become more like those kernel classifiers and no longer give us the exponentially better representation power they are supposed to deliver.

&gt; What's so great about ""Extreme Learning Machines""?
&gt; 
&gt; There is an interesting sociological phenomenon taking place in some corners of machine learning right now. A small research community, largely centered in China, has rallied around the concept of ""Extreme Learning Machines"".
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly, I don't understand what's so great about ELM. Would someone please care to explain?
&gt; 
&gt; An ELM is basically a 2-layer neural net in which the first layer is fixed and random, and the second layer is trained. There is a number of issues with this idea.
&gt; 
&gt; First, the name: an ELM is *exactly* what Minsky &amp; Papert call a Gamba Perceptron (a Perceptron whose first layer is a bunch of linear threshold units). The original 1958 Rosenblatt perceptron was an ELM in that the first layer was randomly connected.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, the method: connecting the first layer randomly is just about the stupidest thing you could do. People have spent the almost 60 years since the Perceptron to come up with better schemes to non-linearly expand the dimension of an input vector so as to make the data more separable (many of which are documented in the 1974 edition of Duda &amp; Hart). Let's just list a few: using families of basis functions such as polynomials, using ""kernel methods"" in which the basis functions (aka neurons) are centered on the training samples, using clustering or GMM to place the centers of the basis functions where the data is (something we used to call RBF networks), and using gradient descent to optimize the position of the basis functions (aka a 2-layer neural net trained with backprop).
&gt; 
&gt; Setting the layer-one weights randomly (if you do it in an appropriate way) can possibly be effective if the function you are trying to learn is very simple, and the amount of labelled data is small. The advantages are similar to that of an SVM (though to a lesser extent): the number of parameters that need to be trained supervised is small (since the first layer is fixed) and easily regularized (since they constitute a linear classifier). But then, why not use an SVM or an RBF net in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt; There may be a very narrow area of simple classification problems with small datasets where this kind of 2-layer net with random first layer may perform OK. But you will never see them beat records on complex tasks, such as ImageNet or speech recognition.

The idea is to try and use Fourier Transforms of time series in distance matrix of a clustering algorithm in place of the occurrence vectors.
The potential use cases may include things like telling which are busier traffic signals and less busy ones if number of cars passing through them every minute is known.
For example I would consider traffic signals 2,0,0,0,0,2 and 1,1,0,0,1,1 busier as compared to 1,0,0,0,0,1. Now if we try to apply k-Means over data like this, instead of passing just the total number of cars passing, we might want to ""deorder"" the series into frequency domain using Fourier transform and then give it to distance matrix.
First of all does this line of thought make sense at all ? When I do it for some sample data, I can see that the Fourier transforms do give some estimate of both total frequency and the spread of the data. Also if it makes sense, what might be the possible real world interpretation of such Time Series transforms ?

Recent work in NLP has shown impressive results with RNNs (language modelling, language translation etc). However, these problems involve mainly modelling the transition probability between states. For example for language modelling, the number of occurrences of a repeating word will be negligible. 

However, there are several problems where the symbols in the discrete space being modelled repeat themselves. For example RNN phoneme models when used for phone recognition have to deal with the problem of repeating phonemes over frames (Boulanger-Lewandowski et. al.). Similarly, RNNs when used to model frames of MIDI music have to model repeating frames (Suskever, Boulanger etc). 

I was wondering if there is any literature on duration modelling and RNN states. What kind of duration models are implicitly learnt by RNNs? HMMs implicitly learn exponentially decaying distributions for state distributions. Is there any way to infer what duration distributions RNNs learn? Are there any simple ideas that could be tried to improve/evaluate their duration modelling capabilities?

I recently got a position (unpaid) as the IT specialist for my job (our organization is also a bit of a club/volunteer organization). Right now, shifts have start times and no end times, which I think is really inconvenient for our members. Unfortunately, we are not told end times. On the bright side, we know how long shifts took after they were worked and similar shifts take similar amounts of time. Factors like day of the week, words in the shift title, and start time influence the length of the shift. I want to make a program that is integrated into our shift picking program that predicts the length of shifts based on priors. I know a bit about bayesian networks and I at first I thought this would be a job for them. However, my knowledge of bayesian networks ends at random variables with a finite set of values and nothing in between. I am not looking for someone to solve my problem for me but I was wondering where I should start. I know bayesian networks can be used for this kind of thing. Is there something I could read? Am I headed in the wrong direction? Is there some sort of better method for predicting these values? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

This software leverages a relatively new machine learning technique known as [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) which relies on artificial neural networks. It enables a machine to know what is in a photo, but I argue that a machine cannot yet understand what it sees in the photo.

I have a hypothesis on what it means to ""understand"" something versus merely having knowledge of a concept, and I am interested in feedback.

**In summary:** Understanding a concept requires the aggregate of having 1) knowledge of the singular concept's existence and 2) knowledge of and associations with closely-related singular concepts.

**In detail:**

1. A concept is physically stored as the weighted connections between neurons within a cluster of neurons (a ""neural cluster"").

2. Having knowledge of a single concept means that a neural cluster representing the concept (a ""concept cluster"") exists for that concept.

3. Understanding a concept requires having knowledge of related concepts as well as associations between the concept's concept cluster and the other concepts' concept clusters. Thus, the concept cluster is associated/linked via synapses with concept clusters for other, closely-related concepts.

4. A concept merely acts as a very concise summary of the other concepts linked to -- much like a word in human language is a fast way to reference something. Because a concept cluster is associated with other concept clusters, the whole of the linkage to other concept clusters is what actually defines a concept and gives it meaning.

5. Understanding allows for recall of a concept and a subset of its associated knowledge. The action of recalling a concept results in activation of multiple, closely-associated neural clusters. When one cluster is activated, it quite possibly (depending on signal strength) activates other strongly connected clusters (i.e., causes action potentials in multiple neurons within these clusters) in a cascade effect. Further, an activation feedback loop ([more info](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/28xf1x/how_can_we_learn_things_so_quickly/cifhykf)) may occur as a byproduct of recall such that neurons are constantly reactivated over time with gradual activational decay. This feedback loop could be what is known as short-term memory.",11,2,False,self,,,,,

I've been using machine-learning in conjunction with neuroimaging for quite some time now.

The long and short of it is that:

1) I have time-series of brain data (~1 3D picture of the brain every second)

2) I denote activity-states of the brain based on onsets-of-interest (e.g at this point in the time-series they were doing a memory task)

3) separate each picture into voxels (3D pixels)

4) Use subsets of those voxels as features in a classification that aims to dissociate activity states from one another.

Typically, someone may be doing a task over the course of 10 seconds. In this case, we'd have 10 pictures. Normally, we confound this with a hemodynamic response function, sum, and end up with 1 set of features-- 1 average activity value for each voxel.

Recently, I've been playing around with skipping this part and feeding all 10 pictures in at once, so as to capture a spatio-temporal pattern of activity instead of just a spatial pattern.

While classification improves significantly, I was worried about the lack of independence amongst my features. That is, one feature is the same as another feature, just one time-point in the future.

Is this okay? If not (or even if it is), is there a way to ""bind"" certain features such that they can still contribute to a classifier, but the classifier knows about their non-independence?

I'm used to SVM, LASSO, and logistic regression, but would be more than happy to explore new classifiers.

I've checked that finite differences matches my back-propped derivatives even over large sequences (at least when I use a CPU implementation...on a GPU there are often significant precision issues).

But to really check the architecture I want my implementation to pass the sequence order task (6a) of the Hochreiter-Schmidhuber 1997 paper.  I modified the test slightly so the two tokens are placed somewhat randomly but always with a significant seperation between them (that grows with the sequence length) and also I ask the network to output the correct answer when it sees a particular input token rather than at the end of the sequence.  So e.g. I have a random alphabet (a,b,c,d) for most of the sequence, two special tokens (x,y) input at random timesteps but spaced far apart and a final input token e which always appears at a random timestep near the end of the sequence.  After the network sees the input e it should output 1-4 depending on the possible orderings of x and y (xx, xy, yx, yy).

Unlike HS97 I train with minibatch learning (rather than online) and backprop through time rather than RTRL (which I don't know anything about).  This makes it very hard to compare results unfortunately or to steal hyper-params from them.

My LSTMs are able to acheive 100% accuracy after several epochs (of a few thousand examples) for sequence up to length ~75 (here the min seperation between the x,y tokens is ~30) but when I try sequences of length 100 I can't get it to work.  They claim to get 100% accuracy after only 30k examples but of course they use online learning (so they're doing far more updates than I am).  

Even for sequences of length 50 or 75 there is a lot of hyper-parameter tuning needed to get it to work so I'm wondering if  my implementation really has a problem or if I just need to work harder to find the right parameters.  

Has anyone had any luck with this task using BPTT and if so can you share your hyper-params and # of training examples?  ",6,3,False,self,,,,,

The goal is to have machine learning pick which stocks will outperform the market indexes following earnings announcement. This should be recognizable because there is a lot of known and successful research in ""post earnings announcement drift"", showing stocks do drift upwards following announcements of specific quality levels.


This being the case, I setup the problem basically as follows:
Input for SVM:
% Beat EPS, % Beat Rev, (A couple other columns)
Mapped to an Observation state of percent change after x days, where x can be 1, 5, 10, 20, etc.


I train on data from 2011, and test on 2012, (etc) asking the machine what predicted state the stock will end up in, and then reveal what the actual changes were. I have data from 2011 to today.


I bin the input data into 3 or 4 different states, so that something like 857% is bin 4, and -20% is bin 2, and -756% is bin 0, etc.


To optimize the problem I am running through all the different combinations of the bin cut offs and finding the model that has the most consistent median and average return, and with the smallest standard deviation, for each year.


My question is, is there a better way to find this ""most consistent model"". And the thing that really stumps me is the ""number of days"" to hold the stock. The research papers say 1/6th of the movement is in the first day, but I've had good results on each x days I've tried (5, 10, 20). 


My plan is to add all the days, from 1 - 90, to the model search, so I have to perform 40*40*40*90 model tests essentially. This will take my computer all week, so I was wondering if there might be a better way. Is there a way to map the attributes to two observation states?


Thanks, let me know if anything is not clear.

Currently I am working on a university IEEE project called Robomagellan that will be competing with AVC Sparkfun's 2015 competition (stupid, I know, we dropped out of the actual RoboMagellan competition).

Being that this is my first real project dealing with machine vision, I've done some research into object detection of unique objects (unique as in anything, really). Based on what I've read, this means I need to use some sort of classifier (I've only been reading on HAAR(?) classifier). My question is how would I go about detecting images such as http://imgur.com/3Tg1J4P  ?
Can I just find any sort of red barrel and train the classifier or would I need to scour youtube for videos of the actual competition and take stills where there are these barrels?

Additionally, I know that all the positive images required need to be similar as in they are cropped to a specific size showing only the object of interest, but does this mean they need to be the same size or need to be the same aspect ratio? So for example would it be fine if I find some object that is cropped to 50x50 pixels, and have another image, maybe its taken closer or further way and if it turns out to be 100x100 or 25x25 cropped?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Terribly sorry if I double posted in two subreddits.

I'm a third year PhD student in the UK who is nearing the end of my study, and have some questions to anybody who has transitioned from the academia to the industry before:

1. Is going to a postdoc considered necessary if I want to go to the industry after finishing my PhD? If I do a postdoc, that would be pretty much on the same field (bioinformatics) as what i do now. I'm kind of feeling burnt out from academia, so I'm considering the jump to the other side. For example, [this kind of job ads](http://www.indeed.co.uk/viewjob?jk=1a8ee57050c8bd48&amp;amp;amp;amp;q=machine+learning&amp;amp;amp;amp;l=london&amp;amp;amp;amp;tk=19l5gk4ds9n1edcf) or [this one](https://boards.greenhouse.io/workingatbooking/jobs/41969?t=7cu1qi) are pretty appealing to me (these are just random examples). I also got in touch with a recruiter from Google, although everything is still pretty tentative now -- haven't been to any interview yet. I suspect doing a post-doc might make me overqualified for such positions or make me viewed as too 'sticky' to the academia, if that's true?
2. If I go to the industry straight after the PhD, I take it that this is a one-way trip then? Seems like the chances are low to return to the academia after this, is low or at least I haven't heard any who has successfully done so? Apart from some famous figures in the field.
3. For those who are already in the industry, how's your working day like and what's your background that led you to the job? Do you spend most of your time on feature extractions, like what people tend to say about such work, or there are interesting ML/CS/engineering challenges involved in the work too?

-------

Thanks for reading. My background is below.

My PhD work is mostly on ML/Bayesian modelling applied to biological data -- so I worked on the development of Bayesian models, e.g. hierarchical mixture models with non-parametric priors or topic modelling like LDA, to find interesting things/produce a generative process to explain my data. I also work on feature extractions and cleaning, implementing various inference procedures (mostly MCMC-based, with the occasional variational inference throw in), followed by model selection, evaluation of performance etc. 

I worked as a software engineering for a couple of years before grad school, so I have experiences with enterprise-y stuff too, like Java EE and others. Coming from a mostly CS background, my math isn't that great as those from a math/stats background, although I have enough general machine learning knowledge (classification, regression, clustering) to get by and get my work done. The same goes with the biological side of my knowledge. It's a bit of ""fake it till you make it"" situation here.",34,8,False,self,,,,,

Then I'm given a chunk of text.  I want to quickly find out with decent accuracy whether one of my 10 million paragraphs is contained somewhere within that chunk.  Essentially finding a substring or near substring.  Maybe a substring match can be done to confirm a positive, but that's expensive and I don't want too many false positives.

A naive approach I thought of would be to compute the top (say) 5 ngrams with the most entropy of each paragraph I have, and store them on disk with those top 5 ngrams as 5 separate keys for that paragraph.  Now I'm given a chunk of text which *might* contain one of my paragraphs.  Now I compute the top 5 ngrams of it, maybe use the top 2 to do a look up, and then with the paragraphs that look up returns, see if one or two other ngrams match.

Additionally, the surrounding 'noise' text is not guaranteed to not be about sports.

Any ideas?

Nested cross-validation is a useful technique to select among different algorithms. Via the outer loop, you select the training and test folds, and in the inner loop, you tune the hyperparameter tuning and select the model based on the performance of the test set selected in the outer loop. Pooling the average performance scores and looking at the different models is then a useful indicator for the model stability and its performance. However, after nested cross validation, it's still useful to tune the hyperparameters of the best selected algorithm and perform model selection in a new round of k-fold cross-validation to tune its hyperparameters, and a separate test set (data that the algorithm really hasn't seen before, neither in the tuning nor the model selection process) is required to get a fairly unbiased estimate of it's true performance.

In my opinion, this is kind of violated in the current kaggle leaderboard as well as the independent validation set since the validation set is a subset of the public leaderboard, which leads to biases.

I think that kaggle does a great job, however, I think that most of the submitted models are biased. I am not exactly sure about how to solve this problem, but one idea could be to hold out more data and ask the participants to rerun their model on a new hold-out data set every week or month (only 1 submission should be allowed to avoid overfitting), and the leaderboard could be constructed from the average performance on those holdout sets. 

I am just curious about what you think about the current kaggle approach, and if you have any better idea for how to improve the current situation!",0,0,False,default,,,,,

Note, I'm not the author and I have no financial ties to the book. Just a student with an opinion. 

I finished working through the book ""Mastering Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn"" several months ago, and I found it to be an incredibly helpful introductory level book on ML. 

Why this book specifically?

This is mainly in contrast to the ""Building Machine Learning Systems with Python"" book. That book assumed some level of understanding of ML while the Mastering ML with Scikit-learn book does not.

The reason why I recommend this book specifically is because I think it does a very fine job of merging light theory (using lots of simple examples, plain English, without sacrificing the equations) with usable code. I used it to learn how to work with scikit-learn for a research project at my university alongside a few other people, and we were able to learn by tweaking the code and reading ISL alongside it for further theory. 

Anyway, just a suggestion for the mods to add it to the list of introductory ML books. It's not free, but it's a pleasant beginning.

On a side note, I would also like to recommend ""Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)"" by Ethem Alpaydin as an intermediate level theory book. I purchased it as a step above ISL while still being more friendly than ESL. Again, just a student opinion with no financial interest. I really struggled for a while to find some intermediary step between ISL and ESL, and I think this book can bridge the gap. ",4,20,False,self,,,,,

Unsupervised training still appears useful for:
1. cases with few labelled data
2. transfer learning

4. generative modeling

Although target propagation by Bengio's group is over my head at the moment, it seems like one of the primary motivations was to allow for cooperation between layers during representation learning in contrast to greedy layerwise training which does not (""greedy problem"").

So comes the question, has anyone worked on or have information about deep autoencoders using dropout + relu (or softplus) to overcome the vanishing gradient and greedy problems? It seems like the simplest nongreedy way to train autoencoders.",2,3,False,self,,,,,

Tieleman builds a system where each capsule has a template, and after the image is inputed, it outputs pose variables (x translation y translation scaling etc) as well as a probability that the template is in the image.

The template is then decoded to the output by applying the the specified affine transformation to the output.

The thesis seems to be claiming that the pose outputs for the capsule are learned through back propagating the error between the output and the target, but how is this possible?

I'm a 4th year medical student taking time off from medical school for research. I'm interested in applications of ML in healthcare, and have a basic programming background. I have backend access to all of Epic (the electornic health records system) data at my institution and have collaborated with a ML guy on creating a mortality prediction model using hospital data (labs, monitors, meds, etc)...

We have had great success with the results (implementation is the hard part) but I am hoping to dig into ML a little more myself before continuing my clinical training. I am comfortable using R and SQL, but have had difficulty in understanding how the ML topics I've been reading about online can be applied.


Just wondering if anyone here knows a health IT - ML community I could tap into, or if anyone had any suggestions of how I could learn about applications of ML for other similar questions.

So I have an array of class labels (integers ranging from 0 to 9), and it has a variable length but it's about 10-20 elements long.

It kind of looks like

[8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

Sometimes there are errors where a 2 is a 3 or any other digit, and sometimes there are a lot (although oftentimes &lt;5 errors in any instance). 

I need to convert that into a list of 4 elements. For the above list, the 4 element transformation would be [8 2 1 0]

I tried using the KISS principle and just taking the mode of the quartiles, it seems to work well but I'm wondering if there are any alternative ideas that the community here can suggest for such a problem.

Oh and some more rules to keep in mind:

The list doesn't have to have 4 distinct labels in it, it can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, up to 10 different labels (almost always &lt;5) if it's a really noisy list. The quartile mode system works well in the weird situations where the list might look like

[1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3]

where the above list should be converted into

[1 1 1 3]

Are there any techniques that can be applied to make the network update the weights to conform to a new distribution?


I'm looking at mainly an on-line algorithm that utilizes SGD. Would SGD **itself** be enough to pull the network out of the minima that it might have converged to?  Ideally I would like to adapt to the new distribution rather than completely retrain.

**Update: adding more info**

You are generally minimizing dW/dE where dE is the error. So 'convergence' is generally when the updates to W are very small. I.e. in the simplest sense: 

  - W(t+1)=W(t)-alpha*dW/dE 
  - abs(W(t+1) - W(t)) &lt; epsilon

However, these weights are hypothetically positioned at some local (or global) minima for some distribution that properly enabled y = f(W*x) + b for all given x **up till** now. Now supposing x changes entirely, eg: you are say modeling some sort of traffic pattern and then it changes altogether (i.e. add another cluster node or something). If the alpha is too small it won't escape this minima. So is there a way to perhaps scale alpha dynamically at some point to make this occur? In momentum based SGD the momentum should drop pretty low after convergence I'm guessing. So something like an inverse operation of this. Just curious if anyone has heard of something like this.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

is an edge between two nodes i and j unless i and j have the same remainder
when divided by k. Then the fraction of possible edges that are actually
present is approximately (k  1)/k. There are many cliques of size k, of which
{1, 2, . . . , k} is but one example.
Yet there are no cliques larger than k. To see why, observe that any set of
k + 1 nodes has two that leave the same remainder when divided by k. This
point is an application of the pigeonhole principle. Since there are only k
different remainders possible, we cannot have distinct remainders for each of
k + 1 nodes. Thus, no set of k + 1 nodes can be a clique in this graph.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

RMSProp from how I have seen it is usually implemented:

I'm currently working on implementing the good old, tried and tested, Viola Jones algorithm using a known classifier, but quite stuck on few points. Specifically understanding the classifier, and I think, what even makes a response from applied a haar-like feature. I feel like I'm missing something basic here, and I would be infinitely grateful for clarification

So, the response first. All the literature states that calculating the response means summing the intensities of two adjacent rectangles and subtracting their respective values. It's here that my confusion starts: what then, does the most idle response look like? I thought that if one took, lets say, a side-by-side white-black (type 1a) kernel and applied it on a white pixel next to a black pixel, then a perfect ""hit' or ""match"" would mean that our response would equal 0! But... this clearly can't ever be the case. A black pixel is just equal to zero, and plainly 255-0=255. 

This result only adds to my confusion when I look at any xml classifier.

However, when I attempt to train the network with the same technique, it never converges. The training goes one forever.

Here's what I'm doing, I'm converting a natural-language string to binary and then feeding one digit as a time. Later, I will vectorise the words and then convert them into binary. The reason I am converting into binary is because the network only takes values between 0 and 1.

I know the training work because when I train with an array of as many values as the input-neurons, in this case 1 so: [0], it converges and trains fine.

I guess I could pass each digit individually, but then it would have an individual ideal-output for each digit. And when the digit appears again with another ideal-output in another training set, it won't converge because how could for example 0 be of class 0 and 1?
Please tell me if I am wrong on this assumption.

In my experience, when I try to train a neural network with &gt;4 layers (either convolutional or fully connected), the initial gradients end up being either very large or very small, depending on how the weights are initialized (I initialize them by sampling from a normal distribution with the same variance for each weight).  

In my experience the best way to train such networks is to use small initial weights, like N(0.0, 0.01) and then to renormalize the gradients for each layer by dividing by the L2 norm of the gradient: 

renormalized_gradient = gradient / ||gradient||

I then use sgd + momentum to train.  

However, I see a lot of papers where the networks are very deep and the authors don't use this sort of gradient clipping.  Are the authors doing something special with the initialization that I'm unaware of?

My setup is currently like this:

I have a 2D grid which represents the world map. Typically both ""food units"" of some sort and agents are spawned and distributed randomly on the map. Agents have a neural network, the inputs represent the data from the tiles around them, and the outputs represent movement possibilities to new tiles or actions on the same tile (whichever output has the highest value is the action taken). Over time, agents lose ""energy"" and die unless they eat food. They also require a minimum energy to reproduce, for which I generally create a clone with mutations in the neural network weight, structural links, and neuron units.

There are some things I would like to work towards:

- Understanding how an NN structure may be encoded for the purpose of genetic algorithms such that minor mutations do not always disrupt the network's ability to function (preventing fragility, increasing redundancy).
- Determine if a grid system is inherently limiting or if agents should have continuous movement (and collision detect)
- Symbolic representation is a problem; I want to move toward more complex behavior than instinctual, which means agents communicating ""verbally"" and ""in writing"" by dropping artifacts. However, I don't know how they would encode some knowledge in their output so that it may transferred to the input of another; considering that even basic ""memory storage"" is a problem
- I have only seen multiple discrete value environmental variables encoded as a set of bits in the input neurons; for example, if an agent queries a tile for its basic type (say ""W"" is water and ""D"" is dirt), if there were types A-Z then I need 26 input neurons (that would be 0.0 or 1.0 depending) to encode just that one thing which seems very inefficient. Is there a better way to encode inputs?
- The environment provides a lot of preprocessed information; for example in Polyworld the agents had color/visual neurons to detect their environment and classification happened in a higher layer; for mine I am pre-classifying tiles because I don't care about evolving that classification ability, only the higher level ""what do I do with that information?"" processing. Is this a mistake, is lower level processing essential for learning?
- Increasing simulation complexity from gathering food to specific things like finding items and ""crafting"" new items from it. I'd like some ideas on how I can make the simulation more ""challenging"" without the agents getting stuck at a basic level where they cannot move toward the goal. I was thinking of having multiple goals that are unlocked as part of the fitness calculation as previous ones are sustainably met; example: they are consistently learning to feed themselves, now they need to deal with another environmental factor; maybe they even get a new sensory node to deal with it.

- For the purpose of persistent agents: I feel like my choice of NN units and structure doesn't fit with what I am trying to do. Sigmoid units are good for what I originally was doing which are things like market prediction, or predictive models which is about relating data sets but the answer is known in training. I have tried LSTM cells with limited success. The agents need to do more than I/O processing; for example, how can it ""choose to remember"" a location on the map, and how can that be ""stored for later"" in a neural net? I've learned that sparsely connected network clusters can be better in some ways than fully connected networks (and computationally cheaper). I've also recently discovered spiking NN which may have capabilities that I didn't anticipate. It is incredibly important to choose a structure that fits the function you are going for and despite all my research into it, I still do not know what I should do. For example, the simulation runs in steps (where it is updated, agent actions are taken, etc), agent output is parsed for a ""decision"" and all neural networks are updated (input update, firing neurons transfer their values, output is updated). This presents a few challenges:
- In contrast to many NN applications, I cannot evaluate ""fitness"" of any given output/action; this is because fitness is based on the agent's lifetime: what did it do, what did it accomplish (if specific goals are being rewarded)? At this point the network ""dies"" because the agent ""dies"". Although a better performing network will have a higher chance of replication, it doesn't help me ""train"" the NN at all, it only performs natural selection on random NN mutations (thus it doesn't systematically ""evolve"" the NN structure or weights).
- I am unable to encode symbolic memory into traditional NN units. This could be many things such as: recalling the set of inputs at some time T, storing and recalling the value of some neural unit when another condition exists, and linking action to consequence more than a single step in the past. It is possible for recurrent connections to store something small for a time, and LSTM cells to store a value for an indefinite period, but to store more complex data (related values vs. a single value) I have not found a good way to link neurons to ""memory blocks"" or any such thing and could use recommendation on that.
- Traditional NN neurons that store a value and pass it on with weighting seem very ""brittle"" to any changes when attempting to use genetic algorithms to restructure them slightly, as a small change causes a cascade effect where all downstream units fail.
- In examining spiking NN, I'm not sure how the simulation time step should process in the NN since time is a factor. I'm also learning that a ""tonal"" signal may be needed to ""keep-alive"" the NN, and the perturbation of this signal by input is what causes ""activity"" and ultimately output.
- It's not clear how an NN in the simulation can learn or evolve its weights while alive (ie, within one life cycle). Currently changes are only happening when spawning new agents.


What kinds of designs for both the simulation and the agents (body nodes + mind structure/NN) can improve the system's range of capabilities? What sort of data and processing structures might be appropriate here?

I'm fairly novice to the ML field, having only recently taken some introductory ML courses, and I have a question about LSTMs that I thought maybe you could help me with.

My understanding is that LSTMs are RNNs with memory cells. The way a memory cell works is like this:

* we have an **input gate**, which determines whether the current input to the cell will be ""written to memory""
* we have an **output gate**, which determines whether the current state of the cell will be ""read out of memory""
* we have a **forget gate** (or alternatively, a keep gate) which determines whether to erase the memory of the cell

These memory cells, like any other units, can have the weights of their gates learned through backpropagation.

The part I am having trouble with is this: where are these memory cells placed in the system? Do they replace your typical hidden unit, and a hidden layer is just a row of LSTM cells, or do they work in conjunction with typical hidden units - in which case, what does the architecture look like? Does each typical hidden unit have an LSTM cell attached to it, or something similar?

I hope this makes sense, if not perhaps I can clarify further.

Thank you!",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm working with a motor-task fMRI dataset where I want to classify which action they are doing from a sequence of 3D images. I've tried different neural network architectures, but I'm having trouble getting them to learn anything.

Here's what I've done so far - I'll try to keep it brief.

Originally, the dataset is split up in two experiments of 284 frames of 91 x 109 x 91 voxels per subject. In each experiment, there is 170 frames where they are performing an action (moving each hand, each foot and the tongue twice continually for 17 frames). I've extracted each action from the data, delayed according to a cannonical hemodynamic response function peak (~6 seconds). That is, when I know they are starting an action, I extract 17 frames 6 seconds later in the experiment and label them accordingly. Additionally, the data is normalized to values between 0 and 1.

OK, on to the stuff I've tried. I've tried both CNNs and RNNs with LSTM units. For the CNNs, I've tried both flattening the image, treating the sequences as a dimension in the image (that is, the input is #timesteps x (h x w x d)) and collapsing the depth of the 3D images by taking the mean, treating the sequences as channels of the image. The architecture has been different number of convolutional -&gt; max pooling layers, with 32 filters of size 5 or 15 (arbitrarily chosen, I'm not sure how to pick these hyperparameters) followed by one or several fully connected layers of sizes 128-512 and a softmax output layer. The results has been around random (~20 %) in all cases. 

The RNN has been trained on the flattened images (either downsampled or collapsed, to reduce input dimensionality), where I only take the last output of the recurrent layer (in a sense, I want the network to process the entire sequence before attempting to predict what action is being performed). The architecture has been one or more (mostly one) recurrent layers with 128-512 LSTM units followed by zero or more fully connected layers with 128-512 units, with a softmax output layer. Again, only random accuracy was achieved.

In both cases I have been able to get the network to overfit on very small subsets of the data set (8-16 data points), but when training on the full dataset, the accuracy does not change significantly. However, the mean training loss (categorical cross entropy) does seem to be declining, albeit on the 5th or 6th decimal point.

I am completely new to the world of fMRI, and not an expert on deep learning at all, so it might be that I have missed something completely. I have tried finding similar work, but have not been successful. If anyone have any pointers, or know of someone who has done something similar with some success, the help would be appreciated. Let me know if something I have written is not clear.

Cliche coursera courses with Andrew Ng (geeezus that guy is a king), and ""do this"" style of guidance. So here is my advice as an individual who has already taken courses with artificial intelligence and machine learning.

So as an unorthodox approach, I will describe things in terms of microsoft excel.

**Math** - Machine learning is the most practical harmony of statistics, calculus, linear algebra and discrete mathematics. You have to think multidimensionally all the time, and not just 3d. You need to be very comfortable with thinking in nearly infinitely many dimensions.

Surprisingly (actually very surprisingly) it's actually quite easy to think multi-dimensionally (*cue the linear algebra*) where each column of an excel spreadsheet is a particular dimension. So if we were to assume small images of handwriting that are 30 pixels by 30 pixels then we can flatten this into 900 columns of a spreadsheet (aka a 900 dimensional vector).


Considering that each row is a character image, we then load thousands upon thousands of rows of images that we already know as the particular characters (courtesy of [the MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset). 

Divide the dataset into the 52 (uppercase and lowercase english characters) that we have known since kindergarten. And for each ""classification"" (there are 52 classes) of letters that we already know, take a statistical average (*cue the statistics*) for each 900 columns per each few thousand images that are an ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ... ""Z"". 

We now have 52 averages in 900 dimensions. You now just figured out the near perfect averages of handwritten characters. 

What if we add in a new letter? Well, we figure out which statistical mean (in 900 dimensions) our new letter is close to. If you think of Euclidian distance, then its actually quite easy ([Pythagoreans theorem in multiple dimensions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_%28mathematics%29))

And now we can do character recognition. Fuck yeah.


**Programming** - Excel Sucks, so here is where Python, R and Haskell come into play. The machine learning model I described above is similar to the K-Means and Logistic Regression models, but if you want to get into the more brilliant models of ML, then learn yourself some set-comprehensions to chef up data-representations and multi dimensional sets in to the way you are the most comfortable with. [Discrete mathematics](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/), Its easier than calculus.

**The Bigger Picture**

Honestly, have fun with this. Allow yourself to be very, very confused. The best advise is to be patient and allow your mind some time to all of a sudden *click*, This moment you realize something, you will feel as though you just got projected to fucking pluto. For those who are Mathematicians or Computational Scientists, this is a frequent sensation that often occurs right before sleep and results in frantic ""Holy shit, I know how the world works"" chants until 8:00am the next morning. The following models will make sure you have multiple of these ""HOLY SHIT"" moments that induce said insomnia.

I am currently writing my master thesis in computer science with the Topic ""Ordinal Data in Games"". I already did a small study and want to refine my results now.

I therefore need a lot more people who can answer my small survey. You decide yourself how long do you want to participate. The questions are not depended on each other.

Just give it a try and read the one page description on http://heleska.de:8000/ and continue afterwards directly to the study.

I would be glad if you help me.

I'm fairly new to machine learning and I recently discovered topic modelling.

My data set is 10's of thousands of customer support tickets, with the back forth responses between the customers and company employees.

So that's my corpus. I have decided that the best thing to be considered a ""document"" in this corpus is the name of the support ticket (oftentimes it includes import key words) and the many notes that have been left on the ticket.

My process right now is the following pipeline:

* Step 1. Compile title and notes into one document.

* Step 2. Clean the living daylights out of each document.

* Step 3. Using Gensim create a dictionary of words from the corpus.

* Step 4. Transform the corpus using Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf).

* Step 5. Train a Latent Semantic Analysis model.

* Step 6. Given a new document or set of documents use the Tf-Idf and LSA models to categorize the new document in some meaningful way.

I have gotten OK results with this pipeline. In the course of Step 2 (the cleaning part), I realized that I could pull some meaningful information from the notes that would allow me to go to some other, more rich, data sources to get further details. For example, if I this was for a retailer, perhaps I would be able to scrape a PLU and could go get some product information.

So my question is, how should I handle this additional data?

My first, and most simple, instinct would be: scrub this additional data (it might contain some other extraneous information), and then just plop it on to the end of the document for which it's relevant. But this seems like a regression...I'm going from some pretty specific and relevant data, to then having it transformed in step 4, and possibly rendered ""extraneous"" by the model in step 5. But I know for certain, some of the information is QUITE relevant and important, and I don't want to risk having it swallowed up by my models.

I am wondering if anyone could lend a thought to the best way to deal with rich metadata while topic modeling?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A final note is that I cannot get this metadata for every document...so I think there is still a lot of benefit to be had by actually topic modelling vs. **just** using the metadata.

**TECH NOTES:**

I am using python 2.7.

I am using pattern 2.6 for my text parsing/cleaning.

I am using gensim for my topic modelling.

I am toying around with scikit-learn for clustering.

And I'm using pandas/numpy/matplotlib for exploration with my results.

I'd like to hear your opinion on what I've ""probably understand"" about each node and from this model I just made w/ labels - [LDA Model](http://oi57.tinypic.com/28kkgwl.jpg). Kindly correct me if I'm wrong

1. **** &amp; **** are hyper-parameters that control the ""sparseness"" of the clustering. Are there other things that they control?

2. **** is the mixture of topics within the document (in my case, the possible topics in the tweets). I'm not sure how this works

3. **** is the distribution of words to topics. Let's say for example: 
    animals: {cat, dog, bird, etc.} 
    fruits: {apple, banana, grapes, etc.} 
    education: {school, student, teacher, etc.} 
This is also where the Inference does its job right? The burn-in iterations for learning with *Gibbs Sampling*? (correct me if I'm wrong)

4. ***Z*** is the decision making where the word (***W***) should be assigned. (How I imagine this is every word captured on every iteration, it will be assigned a score where it's most probable then it's passed to ***Z*** and assign it where it's near. Like let's say word (***W***) ""bird"" got score of 0.33. It is then passed to ***Z*** to place the word where it's appropriate. Let's say the topic ***Z*** ""animals"" is assigned to a score of 0.35, since the word has a score of 0.33 and it is near to topic ""animals"" with a score of 0.35, the word is assigned there and that's that. Then word (***W***) iterates and moves to the next word and loops this until the tweet is finished.)

5. ***W*** is basically the word being observed at every iteration?

6. Plate ***N*** iterates over all the words in the tweet and repeats the process of ***W*** and ***N***. Basically it gets the current word ***W***, based on the score, it assigns it to the proper topic ***Z***

7. Plate ***D*** and Plate ***K***, I find them confusing because of the parameters and I'm having a hard time understanding *Dirichlet Distribution* because of the overwhelming math figures that barely understand. Got totally lost when I arrived on the part where there are formulas with integrals and limits.

Can someone explain in simpler terms the figures below without using too much math on how LDA flows and what really happens on each node in words? Found from this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/372tyj/naive_bayes_for_document_clustering/)

$i_t = \sigma(W_{xi}x_{t} + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + W_{ci}c_{t-1} + b_i)$

Similar to ImageNet (most are photos), but for sketch images, there is a dataset published by TU-Berlin, where human can, on average, achieve 73% accuracy.

Since it was published in 2012, many researchers have worked on producing better sketch classification models, however, none of those has successfully beat human so far.

Quite recently, a team in University of London tried to nuke this problem by deep learning, and not surprisingly, they have managed to make machine intelligence surpass human (75% vs 73%).

DSL Shared and Unshared Task at LT4VarDial Workshop - RANLP 2015 (http://ttg.uni-saarland.de/lt4vardial2015/dsl.html)

Discriminating between similar languages and language varieties is one of the bottlenecks of language identification systems. This aspect has been topic of a number of papers published in the last years as well as the first edition of the DSL shared task in 2014. This year we are organizing a new edition of the DSL shared task with new languages, a new evaluation methodology and an unshared task track.

In the unshared task, teams can use any version of DSLCC as a resource to investigate differences between similar languages and language varieties using NLP methods. The fundamental question that unshared task participant should answer is: ""What are the most important differences between these similar languages and language varieties?""

Some question about the first-layer features of a convNet.

I've heard that nowadays people just use backprop to train a convnet. But I think, as in animals, the features in the first layers should always look like edge detectors, and it should be independent of the goal of the whole network : No matter what the task is, caption labeling or image segmentation, you should always get edge detectors in the first layer.

But if that assumption is correct, then the features in the first layer must only depend on the input statistics of its reception field. The only way I know at the moment is to pretrain it using autoencoders or maybe RBM. But my question is : is there some optimal criteria for these features?

For example, if I have 2 neurons, each sees a 10x10 pixels patch in the image, and most of the time in the 10x10 area it's either a uniform patch or there is an edge, then, is the horizontal/vertical edge detectors the optimal features I'll get (or up to a rotation)?

For example, would I be able to understand what the different chapters of Bishop's book are about and be able, if I wanted to, to just go to the chapter I want to learn more about and read that?

Also, the programming parts of the homework are in Matlab. Are they feasible in Python too? Are there even Python solutions out there?

I understand that the input, output, and forget gates of a block depend on (the nonlinear activation of) a weighted sum of other block outputs, the values in the cells, and the input data. 

Furthermore, I see that when these weighted sums are squashed by a sigmoid, the gate value is in [0,1]. The values in the cells are then either updated (written) (if the input gate is ""open"" and forget gate ""closed"") or kept the same (if the input gate is ""closed"" and the forget gate ""open""). Similarly, the value in the cell is either output (read) or not, according to the value of the output gate. This leads me to two questions.

1. I don't see anything mathematically that makes these reads and writes perfect - i.e. since the gates don't seem to be constrained to be exactly equal to 0 or 1 (by some min/max or floor/ceiling business or something), the data in the cell is not perfectly overwritten or perfectly kept. 

2.  Given that the data is kept if the forget gate is close to 1, shouldn't it be called a ""remember"" gate? :)
