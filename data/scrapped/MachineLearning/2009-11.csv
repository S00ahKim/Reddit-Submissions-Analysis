The labels in the train set look more or less like this:

    000000???111111???00000????111??0000??22222????00000
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The x-axis here is time, the numbers on the first row are the labels I know about and the question marks are there because I don't exactly know what the labels there should be. The second row is just used to refer to timepoints in this example. The question marks really show transitions from one label into another, but I don't know exactly where the transition is. This means that a question mark should be one of the two surrounding labels (and not anything else) and that if we have AA????BB and the second question mark is a B, then the next ones should also be B's.
My first problem is basically how to incorporate the information I do have about these samples in my algorithm.

The second problem has to do with the fact that not all labels are equally important. If for every group of non-zero's just one would be classified correctly and the rest would be classified as zero, that would be great. So in the above example I would be happier if all samples would be classified as zeros except *m*, *B* and *O* than if for instance *j-o* would be classified correctly and the rest would be zeros, even though the latter would technically give a higher accuracy.
My second problem is thus how to deal with this unequal preference for different labels.

I guess I could just ignore all of this information I have, but the problem is that when I do that, performance is very bad. Of course, there is no guarantee that using it will make things much better, but I'm hoping it will.

I'm still quite new to this field, so if anyone could point me in the direction of algorithms that can be used for this, suggest resources that apply to this or even (like books, webpages or other places to ask questions like this; a StackOverflow for science questions would be great) come up with solutions for my problems, that would be great! I've tried to keep this as abstract and general as possible and I hope it is still clear what the problem is. If not, please ask and I will try to clarify. If you feel it's inappropriate for me to ask you to help with my problems, feel free to downvote. Thanks for your time!",4,6,False,self,,,,,

If people could throw some Ideas at me, it would be grand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/a53g1/im_trying_to_make_an_order_preserving_estimate_of/,TheMonkeyOfLove,1258425139,"I have a bunch of (multivariate) samples from a probability density, and at the moment I'm using a kernel density estimator to recreate the distribution.  My eventual goal is to be able to take a series of points and order them by decreasing likelihood.  In other words, I don't need to estimate the probability function, but an order preserving transform of the probability function.  My first thought was to just estimate the original function, because it's obviously order preserving with itself, but as I started to tune the smoothing (bandwidth) parameters I was finding that I needed to over-smooth the distribution quite a bit to get good results.  It looks like having a bit of variance is just fine if I'm trying to minimize the error between my estimate and the underlying distribution, but if I'm concerned about ordering, it completely kills me.  

Does anyone out there know a better technique for reconstructing a likelihood function for a set of samples?  Or maybe a modification to my kernel estimator that would help?  Please ask me questions, if you don't understand exactly what I'm going for.  I doubt my explanation is all that clear.
