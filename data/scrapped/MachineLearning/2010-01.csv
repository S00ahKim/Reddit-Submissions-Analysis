I have a decent understanding of statistics and statistical concepts-I read tons of books and articles.  I'm also good with Python.

I do lots of data analysis, on my own, whenever I can find available datasets.  With my SQL and BI experience, I know how to 'slice and dice' and aggregate data every which way.  I am also pretty handy with R and ggplot2.  

ML and the like is what fascinates me.  I respect everyone's intelligence (and PhDs!!) and would like some (accessible) suggestions on taking my abilities to the next level.

Ideally, I'd like to pair up with a project/startup where I can give hardcore dba skills in exchange for pairing up with ML experts.  I'm not a web developer by any means but whenever I look at data-driven sites(for example www.tweetstats.com - no affiliation), I think about how easy the calculations are and that I could do just that.  I 'get' data but would love a deeper understanding of ML/Mining. 

I'm not aware of any collaborative or open-source ML projects.  I follow a ton of ML and datamining experts on twitter(same username) and participate in engaging conversations.  When I don't fully understand something, I'll spend hours, or even days educating myself.

Now the hard stuff - My degree is in a completely unrelated field.  Having said that, I'm very competent considering my existing skills and want to take it to the next level.  Going back to school is tough with full time work and two kids to raise.  I'm looking for suggestions on reading, getting more involved with existing projects and learning from others.  


tl;dr i have crazy database and sql/analysis skills and want a ML mentor or project.",6,8

I'm about 1/4 of the way done. I think it's really valuable knowledge so I'm going through every detail and developing a deep understanding. 

I'm hungry for real problems to solve, for real projects. It's exciting to see there are plenty of them I can engage on online.

However, learning and exploring potential projects is much more fun, productive and efficient when done in a group.

We could work through this course together. We now have a CrunchCourse page! We can start using the forum http://www.crunchcourse.com/class/stanford-cs229-machine-learning/2010/jan/

Summary of the course:
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory; large margins); reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.",19,30

1. Find a message board/forum/mailing list where students, assistants and professors are participating in various debates.

2. Gather large amounts of raw text data from these forums/message boards. (I need to find large amounts of pairs: raw text content -&gt; is professor/ is assistant / is student)

3. Try to find a way to predict who wrote the message based on a raw text input.

Implementing this will not be a problem since I'll be using:

 * [scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) to gather all the data 

 * [orange](http://www.ailab.si/orange/) library - because it has a sweet text mining add-on and a decent implementation of the naive bayesian classifier 

Ok ... now that you have some insight to my assignment ... **here is where I ask for help**:

If your college/university/faculty has a forum/message board that is **readable without any authentication** and there exists a trivial way to **distinguish the role of the author of a single post/message** (is the author a professor, student or assistant) - please post the link to that resource. 

Thank you for your help.",9,4
