I am wondering about estimating predictive variances for regression splines. In particular, I know that I could fit a cubic spline to predict the mean given some input, but what if I am interested in the output likelihood. I know that gaussian processes do this, but for reasonable size datasets with ~5000 points, gaussian processes take a long time.

Why not simply fit a local variance using another cubic spline, such that the predictive gaussian distribution is then parameterized by two local estimates.

This seems wrong, but I'm not sure why. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to think about this?

It may help if there is a fast algorithm to do this for a single layer net, because I could settle for finding activations in the second to last layer that maximize the likelihood of the output, and then repeat on previous layers until I have input values.

Another approach would be to train some reconstruction weights to reconstruct the layer below after each feedforward pass during learning, as in the wake sleep algorithm for deep belief nets, but this would suffer from 'explaining away', because the net isn't a deep belief net. (In a deep belief net, the forward weights learn features that are able to be easily reconstructed via the reconstruction weights, thus explaining away explaining away.) My nets are trained to predict a target function, so I don't see any way around explaining away.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, and hopefully see any links to relevant papers that you might have.

**Edit:** I've posted this question here to help me brainstorm before I actually implement anything.

**Edit:** The reason I wanted to find data with this property is that I am training a net to discriminate between genuine data and potentially fabricated data. I need to constantly make fake data that the net will think is real and use those fabricated data as negative examples in the training set. We discussed an algorithm for this in the comments, in which one initializes some fabricated particles, and for each minibatch, we adjust the fabricated particles to make them more believable, and then train the net to accept the current minibatch, and reject the fabricated particles. The learning always makes the fabricated particles less believable, so they are expected to mix quite quickly, exploring a huge space of fake data for the net to learn to reject.

I implemented this persistent CD like algorithm that we discussed, and tested it using the MNIST data set. I used examples from the cross validation set to initialize the fabricated particles, as is common practice for persistent CD. For some reason the fabricated particles don't mix at all. The pixels of the fabricated particles quickly hardened to either completely on or completely off right as learning started, and then changed little for the rest of learning. Even a smudge that wasn't part of a digit hardened and stayed until the end of learning.

The features that the model learned for discriminating this static fabricated data from the training data were just blobs of mixed color pixels, surrounded by nothing in the areas that almost no digit occupies. Something is amiss.",22,9,False,self,,,,,

I am researching clustering algorithms for data that is not numeric. I am not at liberty to discuss exactly on what data I'm clustering (it's proprietary information), but I can give you an idea of the kind of data I have. Also, I am somewhat new to this area of study. Please let me know if my understanding is off and I should be trying different things.

So, pretty much all of the clustering algorithms I've come across so far use some notion of distance to find clusters. This is fine if your data is numeric and it has some intrinsic *value* that we find meaningful. For example, we would consider the value of a housing price meaningful because we could compare two instances of it in a helpful way: $200k - $150k = $50k lets us know that the value of the first price is more than the second. A distance measure would thus be helpful in this case. This is not so for categorical data. Categorical data is where the instances of the feature all fall into a set with no natural ordering. Car makes, for example, would be considered categorical data. We would find no meaning in comparing the names of two manufacturers in the same way we did the housing prices: Ford - Toyota = ??? is not very helpful. Even if we assigned numbers to the categories, the distances we would find would be arbitrary and hence meaningless.

My data is a mix of these two things. I have numeric, categorical, and boolean features in my data sets (I consider boolean data a subset of categorical data, although we *might* find boolean distances meaningful with proper scaling). My research so far has turned up these two promising-ish papers:

* [Clustering Mixed Numeric and Categorical Data: A Cluster Ensemble Approach](http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0509/0509011.pdf)

* [Rock: A Robust Categorical Algorithm for Clustering Attributes](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sudipto/mypapers/categorical.pdf)

I don't know if these are quite what I'm looking for. They seem a bit hand-wavey about certain things (especially the first), but the other papers I found were much worse. Is there anyone on here who has experience with trying to cluster this type of data? If so, could you point me in the direction of some decent papers to read up on?

Thanks in advance!

**tl;dr** - I need to cluster mixed categorical and numeric data. Know of any good papers?

**edit:** I was told you guys would be more suited to answer this question. Please let me know if somewhere else would be better. Thanks in advance.

**edit2:** Also, if you know of a good paper but there is a pay wall, don't worry. Just link it as I can get access to almost any publication through our library.

Most real data is sparse and that compressive sensing randomly samples your input with some (learnt?) bases to compress them to give an error bound that is extremely small.

* If the bases are learnt, how are they learnt? Matrix factorization? Any very simple explanation on how its learnt? And maybe a link/paper for just understanding the learning process?

* If you can, can you explain how it is different in terms of one commonly used machine learning model? (so that it is easy to understand with a comparison)

* Are there any applications apart from reconstructing noisy data, saving bandwidth etc.?

A question that has been consuming my mind for the last couple of weeks is as follows:

**When would you ever choose to do an SVD on the data matrix itself vs doing an SVD on the covariance matrix of the data (PCA), and vice versa?  What are the different end goals that you are striving for with each?**

I work in the semiconductor industry and have been using my new found knowledge to do spatial pattern recognition for wafers, and also dimension reduction.

I've primarily been a reader of this subreddit until now and I was looking for some advice for my graudate research. 

I'm working on on M.S. in Engineering, specifically in Machine Learning. I'm almost done wrapping up the exact direction I want to take my research in, which involves developing an algorithm with thorough evaluation on synthetic and real-world data. 

My problem is to address and overcome the following hurdles:

**Concept drift** (also known as covariate drift, domain adaptation, non-stationary data) - In a batch learning scenario, adjacent time-series 'snapshots' of the data can be drawn from different data distributions if there is a hidden context in the data, causing the decision boundaries to change over time. 
 
**Inductive Learning** - Since the labeling of real-world data can be expensive, the algorithm should be able to deal with only receiving unlabeled data for a series of consecutive time steps until labeled data eventually arives.

 **Imbalanced data** - Prior probabilities for a given class may be heavily lopsided at a given series of time steps.

The restrictions of the algorithm are strictly on the data retention. Training and test data cannot be stored and used in future time steps. The idea here is to deal with the stability-plasticity dilemma in an environment that gradually (simply defined as not completely at random) over time. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or information as to what direction I can explore or what the current methods are that can be used for motivation or a basis for improvement. Another great piece of information would be where I can find real-world data to experiment with. The UCI Machine Learning repository doesn't seem to have anything that specifically relates to concept drift.

I've read a couple books which have summarized some of the following methods [found here](http://sugiyama-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/~sugi/software/) (we use MATLAB for implementation at my school), so I am familiar with these concepts as well as ensemble learning methods using a variety of different base learning models (SVM, MLP, Naive Bayes). 

I've seen a lot of great knowledge shared on here and this seems like a  great place to get advice for an aspiring ML student.

Then you pass it's hidden states as data to a recurrent neural net that does a feedforward pass on every other time step, and train this RNN to help fix the errors in the original one. If one continues to stack slower and slower RNN's like this, it's possible for information to flow through N time steps in only about log N feedforward passes, rather than N feedforward passes as in a vanilla RNN.

My goals were to make it efficient enough to run on Google App Engine, and have a clean and fluent API consistent with modern Java API design approaches.

I tried a variety of different split scoring algorithms and eventually settled on [this one](https://github.com/sanity/quickdt/blob/master/src/main/java/quickdt/scorers/Scorer1.java) which is of my own design, but seemed to yield better results on various datasets I tested with.  The code is of reasonable quality, but could use a lot more unit testing, and there are some complex methods in there that should be broken down.

I came up with an approach to handling nominal attributes (eg. gender, city, zipcode) which seemed smart at the time, but now I'm having second thoughts and wanted some feedback.

So let's say I'm trying to find an optimal split for a ""city"" attribute in a dataset.  Nominal branches in the decision tree are of the form ""is the value in the following set of values?"".

I start by picking the first city, placing it in this ""in"" set, and scoring this split.  I do this for each successive city, in each case creating a set of size 1 and testing the split.  Once I've tested all cities I pick the best one, and it becomes the first city in my ""in"" set.  I then repeat this process, adding each second city to the set, and testing the split.

I keep adding cities to the ""in"" set until adding a new city results in a worse split score, at this point I'm done, I have my nominal decision node.

You can see an example of the type of decision tree this builds [here](http://cord-sa.appspot.com/dumpDT).

My concern is that the trees built using this approach rapidly approach 100% recall on the training set, even with a relatively limited depth.  My concern is that I'm giving too much flexibility to the decision tree builder to construct any set whatsoever at each nominal branch.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this.",12,3,False,self,,,,,

Let's assume that the machine learning algorithm is doing a good job (we've experimented and found the one that yields the best RMSE, and we have confidence in this).

My approach, which I think is common, is to go through each attribute, build a predictive model which excludes that attribute, cross-validate it, and measure the result (using RMSE in this case).  The attribute which yields the highest/worst RMSE when it is excluded is then assumed to be the most valuable to the predictive model.

A colleague suggested an alternative approach which I couldn't think of a good counter-argument to.  His argument was basically that the better the predictive model, the more divergent the predictions would be, meaning that the standard deviation of the predictions would be higher for a better model.

The idea seems to work at the extremes.  A model that always gave the same prediction would obviously be useless, and the predictions would have a standard deviation of 0.

Similarly, a model that predicted perfectly would have predictions only of 1 and 0, and thus would have a very high standard deviation.  You might say that the standard deviation could be higher in this case by making the predictions 50% 1 and 50% 0 irrespective of what actually happened, but we're assuming that our predictive model is doing a good job given the input data, and so that should be an option.

I have a dataset of mildly organized transaction data with limited to no demographic information on the purchasers.  This is a *massive* dataset, totaling in the millions. Transactions can be anything purchased online, from shoes to groceries and sex toys.  My ultimate goal is to have a program that will classify these transactions into their respective industries, so a TV would be placed into ""consumer electronics"" and a T Shirt would be placed into Apparel.  There will be about 10-15 different possible industries as well as a catch all ""Not Applicable"" for industries that won't be looked at.  After this, I'd like to break down the information to categories within that industry, so the TV that went into Consumer Electronics would also be in the ""TV"" category.

In regards to item information itself, I have the merchant and the price, but most information on the item is located within a ""description"" variable.  However, the layout of this variable is not structured.  So a pair of Nike shoes could show up as ""Nike: Size - 9.5: Dunks"" Sliver/Grey/Green"" or could just read ""NIKE"". Pretty much, it's a grab bag as to what's there and how it's arranged.   However, I have expanded information including brand, features, category and all relevant details for about 1% of the total database for each industry.


I was wondering if anyone had a good idea on where to start for this process?

My current line of thinking would be a Naive Bayes method using the 1% of more detailed data as the training set and classifying the data by industry first, then doing it by category. 
Another idea was to use an Inverse Document Frequency procedure to help pick apart that description field and hopefully help classify the transaction.

My intuition tells me that it also has more representational power, if just by a constant factor. It definitely has the downside of being harder to implement quickly on a computer (matrix multiplication won't work as nicely) but if it has greater representational power per neuron than a network with discrete layers, perhaps it is worth some research.

**Edit**: I am mainly asking about feedforward nets in which there is no restriction on connectivity, aside from having no cycles (that is required for it to be considered a feedforward net).

I'm a high school student working on a project at my local university. Our project has some computer vision aspects. Unfortunately, the professor I'm working with is not an expert in computer vision which has kind of left me in the dark on those parts of the project. I'm just looking to get a small start and some suggestions.

I'll start by explaining the problem.

We're working on improving the landform classification accuracy of terrestrial surfaces. Essentially, our sites will consist of many different landforms such as crater walls, ridges, plateaus, etc. Here's a ground truth for what one of our sites looks like: http://d.pr/i/Z4sI . We're trying to do this on a segmented map of that site. The segmented map was done by a k-means algorithm and consists of about 7000 segments. Each landform that you see is made up of many many segments.

What we want to do is exploit the fact that different landforms have different shapes. A crater wall is circular, ridges are diagonal and linear, etc etc. The best way to do this, we thought, was capture visual patterns around each segment. We need to extract a feature on the segment level. We hope that the visual patterns around, for example, all crater wall segments would be similar when compared to the visual patterns around all ridge segments.


The whole point is to relate the segment back to the shape of the landform.


Do you have any idea, suggestions, or papers I could look at for this.

Thanks

EDIT: Just wanted to include this to ward off any confusion. The kind of data we're working with is called a DEM, digital elevation model. The data stores the elevation of every pixel at that specific point. If I computer the magnitude of the gradient vectors of each pixel, this is what it looks like: http://d.pr/i/TfXF . Also, here's an RGB image where the 3 channels are 3 different pixel based features calculated off of the DEM: http://d.pr/i/6n8K . The k-means algorithm was done on the RGB image to produce the segments. You can contrast that with what the ground truth is supposed to look like.

I was first interested in a career as a market researcher but as I learned from my current internship, it isn't that challenging (not really that challenging). What I really had a passion for in my early years of college(which attracted me to market research), was assisting in the product development phase. Using massive datasets to make better decisions about what future products to introduce and what these products should have included in them to make them profitable. I looked into specific fields in data science (data mining, machine learning, etc..) but for me it seems like all of these are in one way or another, connected. What I seek from this post, is a better sense of what I would be doing in a couple career fields involving data science. I looked online for several applications but due to past several events (NSA spying), everything seemed to directed about data mining and the government. If someone could describe the difference between the following, I would really appreciate it. 1.) market researcher 2.) data miner 3.) machine learning 4.) predictive analytics 5.) big data. I apologize for asking such basic questions but every resource online seems to be mentioning similar things to each of these fields.
