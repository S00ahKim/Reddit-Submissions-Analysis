It takes very few batches to get to predicting only spaces and then it slowly learns which other characters may be useful before moving on to short words.

With a relatively small network, fewer layers, and/or shorter sequence length it can start to output semi-coherent text pretty quickly. Making the leap from semi-coherent to coherent seems like it will take a larger network with more layers. But the larger the network the harder it seems to be to push past the local minima of outputting spaces.

I'm not sure if it's the corpus I'm using or if anyone else has experienced this?

Right now I am coding this in python with a combination of scikit-learn and nltk. Someone suggested me to construct a NN since I will be doing this same type of classification a bit longer.

Last week I was thinking about our company's Service Oriented Architecture and all our pipes and collectors for monitoring and stats and logs and so forth, and how unwieldy and difficult to wrangle it is, and it occurred to me that perhaps ML can assist here.

I reason that I could set up a simple NN that took as input the current stream of scalar data from a single monitor, and output [FAULT, NO-FAULT].

NO-FAULT should be the default state, and emits as long as the input follows predicted traffic.

FAULT emits when the input goes some percentage outside of the prediction.

Deploy independent ML for every input, or pipe several related inputs into one?

Regardless, the goal would be to eliminate the need for an expert human to interpret 'good' data vs 'problem' data and set discrete alerting thresholds. Eliminate the need to have deployment-specific configurations; all hosts get the same treatment and the company benefits from better alerting.

This was demonstrated on HTM for monitoring energy consumption of an office building.

Is HTM still the best model for training machines to do this, or have other tools/techniques emerged?

The showcase can be accessed via **[mushreco.ml](http://mushreco.ml/en/)**.

Technical details:

* The classifier has been trained on 208 categories of mushrooms. Every category contains between 60 and 100 training images which is definitely at the lower end. 
* All images have been scrapped via Google, Yahoo and Baidu. The images where filtered by myself to avoid too many wrong mushrooms in a category.
* At the end, I had 18'000 images in the dataset. 
* A pretrained Resnet50 on imagenet has been used as a general image descriptor. 
* The whole work was done with Keras. Keras provides quite cool and easy to use pretrained models!

My first impression of the task was that it will never work. The diversity in only one species is enormous. A mushroom can look completely different if it is young vs. old. Also the amount of available data is critical. But hey, I gave it a try ;)


At the end, the classifier works impressively exact. It will not replace a expert but can help you identifying a mushroom.",22,29,False,self,,,,,

Till now, my experience with ML has been with small datasets in R on my laptop. Which was just simply loading dataset, data processing and calling the specific function. I'm learning deep nets and I'm reading not to use my own laptop as training would degrade it, apparently.

So what I see from most threads, people use cloud services. I've been reading about using ssh to use AWS/other cloud services for faster computation. I don't understand what ssh is, how to use AWS etc. Can someone provide a detailed explanation/links to tutorials on how to start using ML in the cloud for a complete novice, how to ssh and add datasets and ML algos in the different cloud services, what's the difference between the cloud services (which are better).

And also can someone explain the role of GPU's in ML and what I need to do in order to use them for ML?

Basically an ELI5 start-to-end tutorial on how to use ML in the cloud and what roles GPU's play in ML",3,2,False,self,,,,,

All of the training data is crowd-sourced from submissions within the application.

The images are 400x400, and they are shrunk down to 200x200. For some reason, the best performance I have gotten is starting with a 15x15 convolution with a 6x6 pooling layer with a 4x4 stride.

[Layer 1](http://imgur.com/EV4YILx) has an interesting pattern where every other column and row tends to be zero in the convolution (probably due to redundant information and regularization).

Here is [layer 2](http://imgur.com/eQA3enk) and [layer 3](http://imgur.com/ernf3yi).

I currently have a series of linear and nonlinear distortions for input images to artificially increase the sample size, and I've combined dropout, momentum, stochastic gradient descent, and a small L2 regularization in the network. All of the layers use tanh activation.

I am planning on purchasing better hardware in the near future, but smaller networks are somewhat ideal because the application on my website uses a CPU and is not extremely powerful.

levels for games through machine learning.

Let's say I have 500 level valid gameplays (+ invalid gameplays, more can be generated if required) for a grid based puzzle game. Gameplays are essentially path from Initial State to Goal State through Intermediate States using various directional moves like move up, down, left or right.
My question is ""**Is it possible to generate interesting, complex initial game state so that it would be hard/fun to solve?**"" 

Many papers deal with learning to play a game(q-learning) , or learning a policy, etc. But I haven't come across a paper which talks about making a initial game state difficult so that its metrics are maximized like no. of moves required to solve are high, sequences of moves are distinct, etc.

A general solution to such problems would be highly advantageous to game developers. Using other techniques like Monte Carlo tree search etc might be possible, but I guess it wouldn't be general enough or would be supervised in nature. *Here, all that is provided are gameplays.*


The game I have in mind is this grid based puzzle game. 

Orangle : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hi.brett.orangle&amp;hl=en 

Youtube Trailer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTsSh5fTItw

There is initial state. Direction moves like left, right, up and down which changes game state. Final goal state. Other states where no moves are possible (the game is stuck ) or the game goes into invalid state.

Difficulty of puzzle can be approximately based on how many moves it requires to reach the goal state.
 
It would be good if the puzzles generated are as varied as possible. 
This could be measured by sequence of game moves required to solve the level. We can have stats on the number of different blue boxes and their sizes.

Valid generated puzzles could be added back to the training data.


Some questions that I have: 

1] Since plays of the game would vary in number of steps (lets say max moves 20), how do I take the input. What should be my input neural network? Would providing the initial state be enough and proceed from that? Or having a complicated network learn the gameplays will be more intelligent.

2] Do I have to specify goal state/invalid state/stuck state differently or will the network figure it out from the sample gameplays?

3] Would a structure similar to Generative Adversarial Networks be advantageous here? Instead of discriminator network, we would have a module which exhaustively plays the game to reach goal state and then determines the label. 

4] How do we make sure the initial states produced by the network do well
on the metrics i.e. the game is interesting, varied, requires some clever thinking?

I am not sure if people have already looked at this problem. I don't know what terms/keywords to search for. Any help would be highly appreciated.",1,12,False,self,,,,,

Isn't there a lot of redundancy here? 

If you know how to regress the bounding box for a single cell in that grid, can't that be re-used for all the cells in the grid? 
Why learn a different set of weights for each cell?

Or from another angle - if the training data never contains detections in some of the cells in the grid - won't that cause YOLO to never detect anything in those cells?

You could replace that layer with a convolutional layer, so you get parameter sharing across the image.

I guess this is why the SSD detector uses convolutional layers to regress the bounding boxes.

The question is with regard to the predictive probability that appears in Step 3 of Algorithm 1 of the paper. If I am working with a scalar datum x_t, the predictive probability should be a scalar quantity with univariate distribution parameters right? Why is predprobs in gaussdemo.m a t x 1 vector with the studentpdf being evaluated with distribution parameters being estimated at everytime step. It looks like an evaluation of the predictive probabilities over multiple univariate distributions with the stored parameters for all previous time steps/run lengths. Why is this necessary?

I found this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08772 It used MSE or something to that effect, so as a result you'll get blurrier, indistinct results as you remove bits.

However, there was a similar paper, which I think used adversarial techniques to ensure that the resulting sample was always natural-looking, where compressed patches always looked like real image data. Instead of getting blurry as you remove bits, the patches would look less and less like the image you gave it, but still look ""realistic"". In other words, the network hallucinated missing information.

If anyone could help me find this paper, I'd be very thankful! In the meantime I'll look through my very long list of bookmarks of other papers to see if I find it first (assuming I bookmarked it). :)

I am trying to fine-tune an already fine-tuned model (was fine-tuned from imagenet to PASCAL VOC 2007+2012 trainval) to MS COCO. Unfortunately, my caffe-based implementation (py-faster-rcnn) is running into dimensionality issues concerning the input and output layers, which are not trivial to solve. I have done quite some extensive research, but now I am wondering, if this is at all possible (only ML demi-gods seem to have accomplished this) or at all desirable? What is your intuition? Will an aggregated, big dataset with a subset of shared categories outperform a model that has been fine-tuned from dataset to dataset...to...dataset? Thanks a lot!

update: there are two basic directions:
A) fine-tuning an already fine-tuned dataset: 
the pipeline would look like this: imagenet --&gt; pascal voc --&gt; ms coco --&gt; Caltech --&gt; KITTI. During this pipeline, for each dataset, I would change the last layers, while keeping the lower layers static. Also, for each dataset, there would be different categories. 
B) Giant dataset:
Putting all images from all datasets together to create a giant dataset, which I train on the small intersection of categories of each dataset (car, pedestrian).",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Basically, I need to solve a linear system as part of the computation of a neural network. Ideally I'd like to solve a linear system, but inverting the matrix shouldn't be a problem since it's small (100x100) and well conditioned.

The problem with Theano is that it needs [Cula](http://www.culatools.com/downloads/dense/) to work on Gpu, but, as you can see, the website has some problems.

Can you think of a workaround? I googled quite a bit but it seems that my needs are unusual. Is there any other library/framework that will do what I need (on GPU)?

I'm also OK with doing the inversion/solve on CPU and the rest of the computations on GPU, but I don't think one can mix CPU and GPU code in Theano and I think that breaking the computation into many functions would interfere with automatic differentiation.

Hi, fairly new to ML. I've had trouble grasping/remembering concepts through just reading, so I've made an effort to jump onto a project with a problem I'm interested in.

I have data of raw positional tracking data (25 fps) from NBA games (10 players and the ball), and I'm trying to detect when an on ball screen occurs. [Found a paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014_SSAC_Recognizing-on-Ball-Screens.pdf) that did this, which I plan on loosely follow the steps in the paper. I've also found a good source to watch the games associated to the data I have for labelling. 

To start i've implemented the segmentation of the data into actions [*2 Data Segmentation*], and watched one game and labelled all on ball screens to verify the sensitivity of detecting screens.

Right now I'm stuck with a number of questions...

***

**Feature Extraction**

Feature extraction is one thing I'm general pretty clueless about. In the paper [3.2 Feature Extraction], they take all pairwise distances between the ball-handler, his defender, the screener, and the basket (6 distance-time series) and defined the moment that the ball handler and the screen are closest. From what it looks like the features extracted were the time where min occurs, and the mean and average speeds for before and after the defined moment.

Why are those features here chosen, and in what is the general procedure for extracting features?

After that they ""discretize each continuous feature into five binary features based on quintiles"". What does that mean? What is the benefit of doing it?  

I'm pretty interested in general on feature engineering and want to read more about feature extraction and feature selection. Does anyone have a solid resource(s) on the topic?

***

**Small Dataset**

As one person there's no way I can watch all the games and label them (~600 games). In the paper their training/test set was only 252/234 time series respectively. From my understanding having a smaller dataset means it's much harder to avoid overfitting. In what ways can that be achieved and how large should be the dataset be? 

***

Lastly what are the best methods / approaches for time series classification? The paper uses a SVM but from some initial research, Hidden Markov Models, Dynamic Time Warping, and LSTMs are what I see commonly mentioned.

These all appear work both ways - instead of SMT where phrase-blocks are highlighted, the entire sentence is highlighted:

* English -&gt; French
* English -&gt; German
* English -&gt; Spanish
* English -&gt; Chinese
* English -&gt; Portuguese
* English -&gt; Japanese
* English -&gt; Korean

Some things to note: 

* It can fuse together words in German. German grammar allows you to fuse nouns together into a single word. SMT can't do this, NMT does it spectacularly, forming words that have never been formed before. It even does this with words that are very rare, or words that I made up, which is pretty impressive.

 * **The pancake dog is ready!** -&gt; *Der Pfannkuchenhund ist fertig!*
 * **The jam holder mechanism is durable.** -&gt; *Der Stauhaltermechanismus ist langlebig.*
 * **The dark grey road cleaning machine is in the wax cupboard.** -&gt; *Die dunkelgraue Straenreinigungsmaschine befindet sich im Wachsschrank.*

* It can make reasonable guesses as to the gender of a non-word in languages which use genders (French, Spanish, German, Portuguese), and will always capitalise it appropriately in German. For example, I made up the word ""an olutura"", which translated as ""una olutura"", whereas ""a pakank"" translated as ""un pakank"".

 * **When I was walking in the park yesterday, I saw an olutura and a pakank lying on the ground.** -&gt; *Cuando estaba caminando en el parque ayer, vi una olutura y un pakank tendido en el suelo.*

I've [linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/5d17vy/google_translate_recently_implemented_new_neural/) an example of this to /r/linguistics, and I'm hoping they'll do some destructive testing to more fully figure out whether the new algorithm is able to capture the quirks of those particular languages.

I'm looking for examples of basic methods (eg. activation function, optimizer choice, resnet-connections, regularization methods, etc) that work on MNIST but do not work on larger problems.  Or the opposite - they show no or negative advantage on MNIST but are useful at scale.

I'm not talking so much about methods that become intractable at scale (eg SVMs), or domain-specific design choices (eg methods that assume natural images as input), but more basic design choices for deep networks.

The reason I ask is that I'm questioning whether we really need huge datasets and long training times to develop basic methods.",9,3,False,self,,,,,

I looked around on google and arxiv but only found one paper titled ""Convolutional Neural Networks for Steady Flow Approximation"" which is surprisingly from Autodesk. They seem to have produced some pretty interesting and impressive results, but that is the only reference I have found. Most papers are in reference to mapping CFD to structural models or predicting rates of reactions in fluid flows. 

http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adp1175-guoA.pdf

Basically, they created input 2D and 3D 'images' as distances from the surface of a submerged object. Then ran a series of convolution, fully connected, and de-convolution layers to predict the 2D and 3D velocity fields. The result was a 2-4 order-of-magnitude speed up on predicting the velocity field compared to the LBM method and sacrificed of 1-3% error. There are some drawbacks with regards to input velocity and control of the boundary conditions, but it is very interesting.

At first I thought there were only ML enthusiasts here until I got replies from actual faculty. Also talk about people meeting and NIPS and such...

So the question is... Who are you or better yet what is your motive for being here?

I can say I work in research in the private sector, but my work as very little to do with ML. I am mostly here to see trends and also try to understand new algorithms which might be relevant in the near future.",138,61,False,self,,,,,

At prediction time, to do multi-step prediction we feed the last input and the output we obtain is considered to be the input at the next time-step. This process is continued until we get predictions for as many steps as we need.
I understand that since the LSTM is trained to do one-step prediction very accurately, this model still ends up with good predictions for multiple steps after the last input. But, as is bound to happen, the uncertainty/error in the predictions grows at each step and we could end up with very inaccurate predictions after 2-3 steps.
I am currently trying the model introduced by Graves for a sequence prediction and I observe that my one-step prediction is quite accurate but the error blows up after 2 steps.

I personally think that we do, and the main reason is that all of the frameworks are doing more or less the same optimizations, which 95% does not depend on the hardware and can be done on the abstract graph (e.g. you can't for instance decide whether you use cuDNN or not without knowing the hardware). Rather than all of the doing their own, literally all users can benefit if this is a unified representation, and people optimizing it contribute together to the same project. For instance Theano's great, eve huge, collections for RNNs would directly help everyone else. MXNet static memory allocation is another example of something that any frontend/framework would benefit from. 

Choice of language - I think for such, similar to Tf should be C++/C. Why? This optimizations are more or less equivalent to a full blown compiler (sometimes maybe even harder). Traversing numerous times large graph - you care about speed. Also C++/C can have external APIs to any other language, so it is easily portable. 

So, I've started something like this here: https://github.com/Metadiff/graph-ir. It is fairly work in progress, however I hope that anyone who wishes to write their own framework with a backend can easily reuse it, especially cause it will give you autodiff for free. A few nice features, which I like, are automatic ""dynamic"" shape inference - e.g. even if you don't know a certain shape size, you can still reason if a == b. Also, I intend to add more meta data automatic propagation. One of the main reasons for this is to give you ""compile"" time guarantee that the graph is correct. This means no more cryptic messages from Theano and Tf because you did not provide something correctly, you get them exactly where you make them in the source code. Essentially guaranteeing no run-time errors except if you get overflow/underflows (nans/infs). Also, all frameworks have run time checks before each OP that inputs are correct. With this you ONLY need to check that the inputs satisfy their constraints and you are guaranteed that the whole function will execute correctly start to end. 

There are however, some design aspects, which more or less I'm not sure what is a good choice. I was hoping if there are people interested in discussing design choices for this as any advice or suggestion might be very helpful. I hoped that I would have this working earlier, but in fact for a good design it takes me a lot more time to write it up. I also know now with so many frameworks, and given that I'm not backed by any company, if the community does not like this idea, it is doomed to fail. If that is the case than maybe the project will help enthusiasts interested in the inner workings of these frameworks to learn about these things. ",6,3,False,self,,,,,

OOM errors.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5dmckv/d_struggling_with_huge_vocab_in_word2vec_in/,mlwohls,1479475245,"I'm trying to build a Word2Vec type model in Tensorflow with my Vocab_Size &gt; 1,000,000 'words' (the 'words' are actually the id's of Wikipedia articles and I'm looking at the cross references between articles as the ""surrounding words"").  The problem I'm having is in constructing the embeddings matrix.  I keep getting OOM errors in TensorFlow.  The network is pretty small, and my memory usage feels like it should fit in my GTX 1080 (avail memory ~ 7.3GB).
Batch Size = 1000 (I've tried a tiny batch size as well)

- Input size (1000,1)  [single indexes so (batch,1)]
- Embed_Lookup Table (1000000, 300)  [I've tried embed lengths even at 50]
- Hidden_Layer_Weights [24 nodes] (300, 24)
- Output_Layer_Weights (24, 1000000)

So by my math, total memory usage should be approx (in MB, using 4 bytes per Float32):

- Input = 4 * 1000 / 1024^2  &gt; 0.1MB
- Embed_Lookup= 4 * 1000000 * 300 / 1024^2 ~= 1,144MB
- Hidden_Layer= 4 * 300 * 24 / 1024^2 &lt; 0.1MB
- Output_Layer=  4 * 24 * 1000000 / 1024^2 ~= 92MB
Total Memory of Model ~= 1236MB ~= 1.2 GB

Even accounting for a 2x memory usage on back-prop, that model should easily fit on my GPU.  Am I looking at this wrong? Or maybe I have my GPU/CUDA/CuDNN/TF configured wrong?

For example, the function below for computing a convolution was being used in every project, and therefore was  rewritten in every project. 

    def _conv_layer(inputs, kernel_size, stride, num_channels, name):
        with tf.variable_scope(name) as scope:
            input_channels = inputs.get_shape()[3]

At training time, at each time-step, we train the model to maximize the likelihood of the true output w.r.t the predicted distribution. 

But at prediction time, at the last observed time-step we predict the output distribution and sample from it to get the input at next time-step. Given this predicted input, we again obtain an output distribution from the LSTM. But this output distribution is not truly indicative of the variability in the prediction because the uncertainty from previous time-step is not propagated correctly (only a single sample is taken). This discrepancy keeps increasing as we do multi-step prediction.

Are there alternative architecture more intuitively appropriate? 

We see interesting architectures for the encoder side, such as recursive networks like TreeLSTM and explicit hierarchical models, but why not invert a tree for use on the decoder side?

My feeling is that the syntax of a prediction evolves secondarily following the semantic intent, and so decoding L-&gt;R is unnatural / suboptimal. When people speak, it's obvious we don't immediately know exactly what to say. It's likely there is a hierarchical process of decoding and organizing verbal phrases. 

Full syntactic structure seems to be realized only after semantic intent. The intent is realized to what is likely a topical anchor word or subject around which the thought is structured. These topics or phrases can be seen as latent variables. Once these phrases are realized, it is a much easier process for the relationship, description, or information conveyed by the sentence to be arranged or generated with appropriate syntax, utilizing those pieces.

Decoding L-&gt;R breaks this assumption, and makes the task more difficult than if prediction was sequence agnostic. For example, to verbalize the sentence ""At that time, the meal tasted good."", a more probable pattern in which the 'latent variables' are mentally realized may be (in order of realization, with ""|"" indicating mental timestep):

the meal **|** good **|** tasted **|** At that time, **|** .


The default decoding direction is to predict the probability distribution after the previous token, but couldn't a 'copy mechanism' be modified to act as a Left/Right switch that allows the model to predict a distribution, but choose whether it belongs before all previous tokens OR after everything predicted?

A more reasonable model with the same motivation would be to add more layers to the decoder. The point is to allow the first layer to predict probability distributions with a relaxed constraint on conditional probability of the next token, and the second layer would potentially capture information about the correct ordering of the previous layer's hidden states. Layers beyond the first would require more connections than just the previous RNN's hidden state, perhaps a connection to every cell in the previous layer. The flow of state would be forward in time across the first layer, and once the first layer completes, the first cell of the 2nd layer begins, forward across the entire 2nd layer, with each cell having a connection to every cell in the previous layer (or receiving their concatenated states). This could be modeled as a single chain RNN with peephole connections I believe. Has anyone tried this?

**tldr;** Sequence prediction models' decoding in a left-&gt;right manner is suboptimal. Have there been experiments with multilayer or other decoder architectures using latent variables or hierarchical structure?",7,5,False,self,,,,,

It's optimizer-based (not feed-forward) and there is a visualization of each iterate allowing one to see the optimizer's progress. The optimizer-based method of stylization renders higher quality images IMHO. There's limited interactivity, in that one can change parameters like the image size or the weights of each layer in the loss function, without restarting.

I am working on a character sequence prediction problem. I have created a (stateful as is defined in Keras) 3 layer RNN in Keras that takes sequences of equal length and tries to predict the next character. I'm training it on a 80million character dataset. I'm using mini-batches and my loss function is (categorical) cross entropy.

The definition of perplexity I'm refering to can be found [here](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/lecture_notes/LectureNotes4.pdf).

What I can not understand is if and how you can calculate perplexity given a single batch's loss, since I'm trying in mini batches.

        loss = training_model.train_on_batch(x, y)

Is this cross entropy error I'm getting the same as in the definition of entropy? Especially seeing how x and y are of size(batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size) can I actually use this error to calculate perplexity?

Code for my implementation is here: https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/rnn2source/blob/master/src/char-rnn.py

Feel free to ask for clarifications, thanks!

Currently it supports scikit-learn, lightning and sklearn-crfsuite; it also contains an alternative implementation of LIME algorithm, so it can be used to explain predictions of black-box algorithms as well (the feature is experimental though). Focus is on text data, but other data is also supported; there are plans to add support for more ML frameworks and expand it to images.

I am looking for relevant papers and machine learning approaches/algorithms to tackle the following problem which I am trying to accomplish on my own hardware platform. Here is the description:

- I have a simple robot arm with 6 joints and a gripper. 
- It is mounted on a table, on this table is an object (say, a small wooden block) as well as a bucket. 
- Mounted on the robot are multiple cameras (at the base and on top of the gripper) as well as on a few ""stands"" that overlook the table. Say there are between 3 - 6 RGB video sources at 640x480 pixels at 24 fps. 
- The plan is to first manually program the robot - by moving joints individually (not physically but programmatically) - to complete the task of picking up the block and dropping it in the bucket. I will record this data: the motor commands (inputs) and camera video feeds (observations) during this ""training demonstration"". 
- From there I want to use machine learning algorithms to let the robot arm automatically replicate the task again, if say its starting position is different, the block is placed at a different initial start location/orientation, the bucket is slightly moved, etc. 
- We can assume that the object to picked up, and the bucket, will start within the reach/workspace of the robot arm. 
- Bonus: while competing the sequenced task, I want to minimize objectives like the time taken to complete it, and the total amount of time each motor joint is powered, to minimize electrical power used.

Is this problem fairly well defined? If not please tell me and I'll clarify further. The eventual goal is to just set up the scene with the robot on the table, the block and bucket nearby, then press ""Go"" on our computer and the robot will run its sequence of learned motor commands, using the video feeds and its learned algorithm, to complete the task, able to work with minor variations in the scene. 

I have a background in machine learning, mathematics, and programming, but I do not know what recommended, say, newer deep learning algorithms and software frameworks might be a good fit for this job. 

EDIT - please also feel free to recommend computing hardware and/or framework, my team has a decent budget towards this research project. So we can buy e.g. an awesome GPU, or get cloud computing, etc.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

I am fairly new to Machine Learning, and I was hoping I could get some tips for improvement here. I currently have an AI set up that learns how to play the classic game of snake. 

My problem is that the snake gets caught up moving in a particular direction initially, and ignores another direction. This means that it is able to find the food in it's path using 3 directions (normally: left, right, and down) and not 4, meaning that any food that spawns above the snake never gets found. 

I would say the snake performs well in 1 out of 20 random starts. Which is very frustrating. With a smaller NN that does not take into acount the position of the snake's body and tail, it performs much better, but then is limited by its body size later in the game. 

Any suggestions for improvement, would be greatly appreciated.

Obviously there are more components to a landing a job than degree/qualifications, but it is a starting point.

But today I saw something really weird. This is a paper by a student and a professor at University of Toronto, Parham Aarabi.


[Title] Hair Segmentation Using Heuristically-Trained Neural Networks

[Abstract] We present a method for binary classification using neural networks (NNs) that performs training and classification on the same data using the help of a pretraining heuristic classifier. The heuristic classifier is initially used to segment data into three clusters of high-confidence positives, high-confidence negatives, and low-confidence sets. The high-confidence sets are used to train an NN, which is then used to classify the low-confidence set. Applying this method to the binary classification of hair versus nonhair patches, we obtain a 2.2% performance increase using the heuristically trained NN over the current state-of-the-art hair segmentation method.

There's a publicly accessible student thesis illustrating the method proposed: https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/72673/3/Guo_Wenzhangzhi_201606_MAS_thesis.pdf

I'd say it is really a bad paper: the so called ""Heuristically trained neural network"" training is just using hand designed rules to extract hard/easy examples and train an NN (Yes, an NN, with one single hidden layer and 96 nodes... I'm dying here) to classify 4x4 patches.

They seem not aware of any progress in convolutional neural networks, fully convolutional models for segmentation, let alone advanced matting methods that handle hair magnitudes better than their results even in the teaser images. (e.g. http://xiaoyongshen.me/papers/deepmatting.pdf)

I'm okay-ish with these kind of frustrating papers if they are published on TNNLS, which is a bad journal. But I'm totally pissed off seeing news everywhere bragging and promoting this bs, and ending with a sentence ""This is the future of AI.""

I sincerely hope those editors are just being sarcastic.

I have a question about the paper on Direct Feedback Alignment (well actually two questions), specifically this paper 
( https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596). 

1) For both FA and DFA we still take the analytic derivative of the layer but replace the W matrix transpose with a random matrix and for DFA replace the ""chained gradient"" from the previous layer with e, correct?

2) What exactly is e? Is it just y_hat-y or is there something else to it like the derivative of MSE?

Just to add a clarification to question 1, if it was a convolutional layer, we would take the derivative of the convolution operation instead of just B (which is the derivative of a linear operation), right?
Then, we would replace the all the weight matrix transposes in the analytic derivative with a fixed random matrix B, right?


Thanks in advance guys!",1,5,False,self,,,,,

If we think at an abstract level of a communication channel, a markov chain model with N states has a information capacity of lg_2(N). He mentioned that in the early days of language models where we train a model to output the next letter given a previous letter, this was the best we could do with computer technology, but he mentioned RNNs have better ""information"". I'm just not sure what he means by information.

My first question, does he mean information capacity? This would make more sense since of course, the information capacity of a markov chain is just the maximum entropy of it's output, log_2(N). For an RNN, there's obviously more capacity, since the capacity is the mutual information of X (the inputs) and Y (the output).

Also, here's the second question, why is this *more* than a standard NN or regression model? I don't see how if we abstracted and treated the RNN as a black box that takes input and spits out an output, how there is more mutual information than an appropriately modeled regression model that takes the same number of inputs, maybe an offset model that takes some previous k letters? Both models take the same number of inputs, and output the same set of character strings, so how is one better than the other in terms of mutual information?",4,4,False,self,,,,,

Either I'm missing something, or this approach is not really as revolutionary as the author seems to suggest. Isn't his idea just a direct generalization of Bayes nets to Turing-complete models?

The author trains a random forest, and then speaks out against using such a model:  
&gt;Random forest is a very good, robust and versatile method, however its no mystery that for high-dimensional sparse data its not a best choice. And BoW representation is a perfect example of sparse and high-d.

&gt;We covered bag of words a few times before, for example in A bag of words and a nice little network. In that post, we used a neural network for classification, but the truth is that a linear model in all its glorious simplicity is usually the first choice. Well use logistic regression, for now leaving hyperparams at their default values.

&gt;Validation AUC for logistic regression is 92.8%, and it trains much faster than a random forest. If youre going to remember only one thing from this article, remember to use a linear model for sparse high-dimensional data such as text as bag-of-words.

I'm looking for a more technical explanation as to why tree-based models are poor choices for high-d BOW features (e.g. a tfidf matrix) while linear models like logreg are the ""go-to"" choice.

Alec Radford, Lon Bottou, and myself (David Lopez-Paz) will be hosting the [NIPS 2016 Workshop on Adversarial Training](https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial/) next week in Barcelona. Feel free to browse some of the [exciting collection of papers](https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial/home/accepted-papers) that will be presented at the event.

The workshop features a one-hour panel discussion where our invitees (Soumith Chintala, Aaron Courville, Emily Denton, Ian Goodfellow, Arthur Gretton, Yann LeCun, Sebastian Nowozin) will discuss the current challenges and future research directions in adversarial training. **This post is a call for your participation!** We will collect the top questions, comments, and issues discussed here **until December 8 at 22:00 (Barcelona time)**, and share them with our invited speakers during the panel. Some examples of questions follow:

* What are some promising approaches to stabilize the training of GANs?
* What does recent research propose to promote sample diversity on GAN generators?
* What are, in your opinion, the most exciting research directions on training with adversarial examples?
* We seem far from generating real-looking ImageNET images; is this because we need better models, or more data? 

The workshop program will be streamed via Facebook Live [in this group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/675606912596390/), so everyone will be able to join the discussion! The stream will then remain available in Facebook.

We are looking forward to your participation, and to see many of you in Barcelona.",42,58,False,self,,,,,
