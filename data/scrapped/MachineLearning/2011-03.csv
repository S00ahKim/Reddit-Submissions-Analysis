So basically, I have a database of articles that look something like this:

          Title     |     Submitter     |     Categories      |
    The Son of Blah |    Mike Elantra   | Science, Technology |
    Getting back t..|   Jacob Delilah   | Science, Programming|
    Stories of Bef..|    Daniel Ellas   | History, English    |
    Friends of Fam..|    Mike Elantra   | Science, English    |

And after you rate a few articles, it looks through all the other articles in the database and looks for how many times you highly rated an article by a certain submitter, or a certain category. So if you 5 starred ""The Son of Blah"" above, it would most likely recommend ""Friends of Fam..."" because the submitter was the same, and it shares 1/2 of the categories of the first article (they both share ""science""). The more you 5 star articles, the more weight it gives to certain categories (so if you five starred the 1st, 2nd, and 4th articles, it would weight ""science"" more highly than other categories, or if you 5 starred the 3rd and 4th articles, it would weight English more highly, etc)

The algorithm seems to work pretty well, but it is ridiculously slow. For 400 articles it took around 20 seconds for the page to load, and for &gt;1000 articles, it took over 40 seconds to load the page, and since I wanted my website to be used by more than one person (and with more than 1000 articles!!), I can just imagine that it will be unusable if 10, 100, or even 1000 people try to use it at once.

The problem, I believe, resides in the fact that it calls the recommendation algorithm every time you visit the recommendation page. I do this because if a user rates a few more articles, I want them to see changes in their recommendations, so  I need to rerun the recommendation algorithm again against all articles to see what the new rankings are. I figure there has to be a better way than to re-rank against every single article, but I can't think of a good way to do so. Is there something I'm not seeing that could help make my page load time go way down?

I'm a compsci academic. I have a problem for which I'm attempting to train a binary classifier, with some degree of success. The classifers I've tried are ID3, MaxEnt, and NaiveBayes (the versions built in to NLTK). I have a suspicion that to achieve great performance with my features requires a classifier that doesn't follow the independence assumption - that is, one that can weight feature values dependent on the values assigned to other features.

ID3 intuitively doesn't follow this assumption, and naive Bayes does (that's its naivety). I'mm not sure about MaxEnt. In any case, my error reduction rate is 43% with MaxEnt, 12% with NBayes and 38% with ID3.

Can anyone recommend a classifier that is good with handling noise, doesn't follow the independence assumption, and can accept nominal features without too much coaxing?

Thanks!",33,14,False,self,,,,,

The key Idea is that data is gathered by the conversations. This data can be used to train bots. Another strength is that the chatter bots stand in competition and can be tested.

The data-gathering idea is already there in [cleverbot](http://cleverbot.com/). But there is a key difference in this approach. In the original [Turing game](http://cogprints.org/499/1/turing.html) there is a human interrogator C, a Human A and a bot B. The interrogator tries to find out if A or B is the bot. Therefore, there are conversations between C and B, i.e. humans that can be used as training data. Imagine this on a large scale where many people play this game, as in google image labeler. This would bring a lot of good data with conversations that aim at the identification of chatbots. This data can then be used to further train chatbots. 

Further the idea is not to train a single bot, but to provide a platform for chatbot developers. The bots can stand in competition, as it is already established in the research community (for example the [Loebner prize](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.loebner.net%2FPrizef%2Floebner-prize.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=turing%20test%20competition&amp;ei=ZMd8TY6uLsbGswaNxsHbBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNmtOxBD5jb1UYDbd4Mp53MOKWyA&amp;cad=rja)). The incentive for developers to use this platform would be the possibility to gather data.

I think this idea has quite a potential, if advertised in the AI-community. It is appealing to the general public as a game and appealing for developers as data-source and competition. As I won't have the time to implement this idea I wanted to share it here. ",8,12,False,self,,,,,

This is why I'm posting some ML conferences here in case some of you may not know about them.  This list is by no means complete, it's just my personal pick of the ""good"" conferences to follow if you're interested in ML.  So, here goes (I'm too lazy to actually put links):

* ICML
* NIPS
* UAI
* AISTATS
* COLT
* ACL, NAACL, EMNLP (they have pretty strong machine learning tracks)

Other, less ML related, but still possibly interesting conferences (by possibly interesting I mean that they get the odd ML paper that can be very interesting):

* KDD
* ICDM
* SIGIR
* VLDB
* COGSCI",31,25,False,self,,,,,

Were a couple of machine learning enthusiasts who have been working for a few years on a MATLAB toolbox to help in our research and projects.  We finally put the effort in to make the toolbox more than a hobby (maybe somewhat respectable even), and were looking for some feedback

The toolbox is currently in a free Beta, and wed appreciate feedback from everyone who is interested in  machine learning with MATLAB.  Like I said, its completely free, and available [here](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prt).
Just sign up for a free account (we promise to never sell your e-mail address, and we wont spam you).
You can get a sense for how the toolbox works by checking out [the quick start guide](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prtdoc/prtDocQuickStart.html).

Weve decided that the toolbox will always be free for academic/educational use (were still deciding what to do for commercial use).
Although you do need MATLAB (later than 2009A) to use the toolbox, no additional MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., stats, optimization) are required.

Thanks in advance for your time, and if anyone has any questions please e-mail one of us:

* kenny@newFolderConsulting.com
* pete@newFolderConsulting.com

Or post on our [forum](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/forum).

Thanks again,

-Kenny and Pete

I've currently got a university project in which I am using weka to apply some classification algorithms to a collection of genotype values. I've had some success using a smaller dataset but now that I am scaling my investigations up to a larger data set with some missing values I am encountering a problem. I've got a list of attributes represented as follows in my arff file:

@attribute blah {AA, CC, GG, TT, AG, AC, AT, CA, CG, CT, GA, GC, GT, TA, TC,TG}

And then my data looks something like: AA,AA,AG,AG,GG,TC,? etc

When I try to open the file in weka it bugs out and tells me that a nominal value has not been declared in the header. I thought that missing values were represented using a '?' character, but do I need to include the '?' as an option in my atrribute list as well?
