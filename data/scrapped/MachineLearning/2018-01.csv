Things I'll be improving next (I had to start somewhere):

- I'm starting with image recognition models, but will expand to other model types in the future. 
- Same goes with targeting Keras, as I'm planning on targeting other frameworks.
- Right now the limit for model files is 250MB, but will be increasing the ceiling, as I found out some models are just huge.
- A better page builder. Right now, it's just a template.

A couple of thoughts/questions:

- Any idea how semantic hashing compares with e.g. doc2vec?

- Are there any efficient implementations (like gensim for doc2vec).

- The original papers auto-encoded a BOW representation of the document but one can imagine hashing other dense vectors (e.g. skip-thoughts for sentences).  Has there been any work in this direction?  I'm curious if the method would apply as well for dense vectors.",6,27,False,self,,,,,

But it seems that there's no empirical confirmation that it works as well as on Go. Assume that no rollout is used just as in AlphaZero. Go's state space is larger than other games, but its horizon length is small (not much larger than 100 timesteps). The state space of many real-world problems grows exponentially w.r.t. the timestep in the following sense. For example, this is the case for text generation (not just sentence generation but also paragraph/essay generation), which is a fully observable non-Markovian (e.g. reward depends on words in long past) decision problem and therefore can be recast into a MDP by regarding the history of all the previous states and actions to be the current state (actions only for text generation) (See LeakGAN for reference). Other examples include: music generation, video games playing and various robotics tasks. This exponential growth of states can be made constant w.r.t. the time by techniques like HRL. For example, you can just consider the history of the last 40 timesteps as the current state and use HRL techniques to make the overall policy to depend on the history of distant past as well. This enables the problem to be dealt with by MCTS. Or you can embed the history of long past to a binary vector of a certain fixed dimension and use MCTS.

If you missed that thread and there's something you want to mention, post it and I'll put it up. Lots of categories didn't have an entry. You can also make a category yourself. 

######**Best Video:**

######**Best Blog post:**

Luke Okden-Rayner's criticism of ChestXray14 dataset.

https://lukeoakdenrayner.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/the-chestxray14-dataset-problems/amp/#click=https://t.co/52PSslbAh8

######**Best New Tool:** 

Pytorch

""and we all realized what a pain in the ass Tensorflow was and how it didn't need to be that way. In the academic community, it certainly to me feels like pytorch has become the dominant framework (probably not backed up by actual stats... But my school's CV research lab has certainly switched over)""

######**Best Blog Overall:**

Ferenc Huszar's inference.vc

&gt; 
&gt; I might have nominated distill.pub instead, but they (and I) consider themselves a journal, which puts them out of the running.
&gt; 
&gt; Writing good blog posts is hard, and as such, I feel like it's fair to weight consistent posting. Signal to noise is the primary problem with following blogs (I'd much rather follow a blog that posts one great article a year than a blog that posts 12 articles a year of which 2 are great).
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, I've found all of the articles I've read from Ferenc to be insightful.
&gt; 
&gt; One other thing: I don't really expect ""novel"" insights out of blog posts. I think blog posts are best served as a distillation of the current state of research, and sometimes an explanation of ideas. If they have new insights, they'd prolly be writing a paper :)
&gt; 
&gt; Some highlights (apologies if there are any highlights from the posts I haven't read):
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.inference.vc/my-notes-on-the-numerics-of-gans/
&gt; 
&gt; An insightful post into one of the problems GANs face in optimization, framed in the form of vector fields.
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.inference.vc/design-patterns/
&gt; 
&gt; Really unified and explained to me how all these different machine learning tasks are just optimizing over a loss surface and approximating gradients.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a couple other blogs I think deserve honorable mentions, including Sebastian ruder's. I think I might write a meta blog post talking about these other blogs one day.

An invented example: Mr. ML scientist programs a classifier to tell if a cat is pregnant based on the weight of the cat.  The classifier is relatively poor, but still has better than chance accuracy, 60% accuracy. And it doesn't require a nvidia GPU either, very cheap!

But I give ML's system a large (5 litre) bottle of water, and it concludes (based on the weight of course) that it is pregnant.


The question: shouldn't machine learning textbooks describe this situation somewhere in their introductory chapters? It is basic, fundamental issue, I think. I have looked, and thus far cannot find any descriptions. Surprised.

It seems obvious (imho) that reducing a classification of all possible objects through a feature that is a single number (weight) will have a vast number of false positives and false negatives. It reminds me of the null space, the infinite number of things that an operator cannot distinguish from zero. Thus the title.

Any thoughts?

I just released a new version of pomegranate. The focus of this version is on missing value support for all models in both the model fitting, structure learning, and inference steps for all models (probability distributions, k-means, mixture models, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, naive Bayes/Bayes classifiers). The general manner that this is done is by only collecting sufficient statistics from observed values, and ignoring missing values. This can frequently achieve better results than using common, simple, imputation methods. 

* I've added documentation to the [readthedocs page](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) under the ""Missing Values"" section
* I've added an [extensive tutorial](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial_9_Missing_Values.ipynb) on how missing value support is handled here
* I recently [gave a talk at ODSC west](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF8BKWe9_i8) about pomegranate and the features recently incorporated (sadly before missing values were added).

The modular nature of pomegranate means that one can now use missing value support in conjunction with any of the other features. For example, one can easily add multi-threading to speed up models, or do out-of-core learning with incomplete data sets, or have both missing data and missing labels to do semi-supervised learning with missing data as well!

You can install pomegranate either by cloning the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate), or with `pip install pomegranate`. Wheels should be built for all platforms soon, but some issues have delayed that. I hope to have them up soon, so you don't even need to deal with Cython.

As always, I'd love any feedback or questions!",13,77,False,self,,,,,

The discriminator of LeakGAN judges whether an unfinished sentence is real or not based on training data of finished sentences only.

Basically I have some slightly noisy but generally exponential data, and I'm running a $y=a\*e^{-bx} $ regression on it. Thats the easy part. Hard part is that the customer wants to know the interval it *might* fall between over time. I'm thinking like one of those election forecast graphs where the prediction interval starts at the CI at the last available data, then diverges more over time. However, all the articles I've found use feature based prediction intervals (looking at the variance in features to guess the PI, but in time series the variance in x is small and constant, so no good) and not only that, but when I implement them they don't so much as meet the CI of the plot. The data clearly varies well outside the interval.

The approach I've done on my own isn't exactly rigorous but does show some promising results is to run bootstrapping and then take the statistics of the parameters of the models and pick some standard deviation off the mean for those parameters. There are a full 360 degrees of possible plots this way, however, given there are 2 parameters. I also doubt it's empirical integrity, but I'll admit the solution does *look* valid.

However, Resnet-50 is [lighter and faster](https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks) than VGG-16. Most FCN models that are released tend to have VGG-16 as their backbone classification net.

Two questions:

[1] What are the reasons as to why the community continues to rely on VGGs compared to Resnets?

[2] An [earlier discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6e6mlf/d_is_vgg_common_in_newer_research_or_is_resnet/) suggests VGGs require fewer epochs to converge, but I'm not able to wrap my head around this. A Resnet with ~1% the parameters of VGG takes more epochs to learn the data. Is this due to the larger depth of the network, or am I on the wrong track?

I am using the Fannie Mae Loan Performance Data [1], but I will give a small example below. 

I am after the following:

1. Probability of the event occurring.

  If we have a data structure as the one I have (see below), I want to create a model, which can give the probability of the prepayment event occurring at a given point in time. 

  For example - if the model is trained on a similar dataset, then if it is given a customer that hasn't prepaid in the first two months of his loan, it (the model) will estimate the probability of the event occurring in the next month. Or maybe given the two months of non-prepayment, the model can give time to event (saying the event, i.e. prepayment, will occur after two months)?

2. When given a set of features, the model estimates probability of event for every month of the loan period (until its end). 

I am interested only in the prediction parts, I have already made all the classical Cox stuff. If anyone can give some advice or maybe some examples on the internet, that would be great. So far I am doing everything in R.

Thank you in advance!

One of the cooler projects Ive had the opportunity to work on over the last year is to help modernize Synacors Zimbra Collaboration Server and bring it up to date with a complete overhaul of many parts of the system. The new open source ZCS release will include a new high-availability, high performance backend, a great new React/Preact based user experience, and a machine intelligence capability to automatically organize content, sorting out smart folders and the most important messages, and providing a foundation for organizations to enhance the Zimbra Collaboration Server through its machine learning API or use it as a platform for experimentation.

The ML server and GraphQL API allows a developer to easily create, train, and use any number of text classifiers, each having its own vocabulary, length of text input, meta-feature input, and combination of exclusive and overlapping target classes. The classification architecture achieves competitive results on some Kaggle classification challenges, which are included as example programs using the API. To do so, it leverages a general, lightweight and fast convolutional network of my own design, which runs fast unaccelerated, works well on a large variety of text classification tasks, and when accelerated, can classify a message in microseconds. The server/API also supports either automatically generating vocabularies from the training data or pre-trained word vectors like Glove or FastText.

One thing that I've been unable to find an answer for is why, besides the problematic dirac derivative, the heaviside (step) function is almost never used these days. 

To me, the heaviside function has a nice neural interpretation: an action potential of a neuron. It either happens or it doesn't. Other activation functions could theoretically be thought of as the probability of firing, or perhaps rate of firing, but that's a less satisfying answer than I presume is buried out there in the literature. 

I understand current activation functions have nice derivatives that make the actual training of the model computational tractable. But is there any other reason to use things like ReLU and tanh that a heaviside (step) function itself cannot?

In other words, if you take a deep neural net and replace ReLU's and tanh's with the heaviside (step) function, would performance be similar (assuming you could efficiently train the heaviside (step) function version)? 

I hypothesize that you may need to add more neurons or layers to perhaps make up for some of the complexity ReLU's and tanh's confer. However, is there anything these nice activation functions do that heaviside itself cannot?

P.S. My search for multi-layer perceptrons have born little fruit, considering they too use ReLU's and tanh's.

I am looking at good Master's programs in Europe. I have researched quite a bit about US Universities and found some of them quite good but I am very late to apply for programs starting by Fall 2018. Are there any good programs I can apply to in Europe? Or are there any opportunities to work with a professor working in ML/DL or relevant groups as a short term project(6-12 months). I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from IIT Madras, India (my undergraduate academic record is average as the courses were never exciting for me except for the Math/stats courses) and been working in the industry for ~3 years in analytics/ML. But I am quite disillusioned with the quality of work. My reason to look for Masters programs are as follows

-To improve my knowledge in the field

-To get access to quality jobs solving interesting problems in Europe/US ( I have kinda skeptical about quality work in India). I might even consider going for PhD but i am not sure about that

-To fulfil my dream of living in various countries (strong preference to Europe on this one)

I am completely lost at this point in life. The only thing I know for sure right now is that I want to learn and work in ML or related fields (My eternal love towards Math drove me towards developing an interest in this field). I would greatly appreciate any help from you guys

I am wondering if the same effect can be achieved by using scaling values for the activation function. Precisely, by multiplying the scaling values to the input of the activation non-linearity, we can stretch and squeeze it in the horizontal direction and by multiplying those values after the activation function, the same can be controlled in the vertical direction. 

Is there some prior work done on this concept that I can refer to? What are the subtleties involved in doing this compared to the traditional bn-&gt;relu non-linearity? How would this scaling affect the problems of vanishing and exploding gradients.

It only has half of a ML library for now, but regardless of that I feel that after working on documentation for so long it is finally to reveal Spiral on this sub. I've been working on it for 14.5 months non-stop now and intend to use it myself. It has been made specifically because I could not get the ML library I was working on in F# for over a year done to my satisfaction.

I'd like to ask those who've done their own ML libraries and have had difficulties to take a look at the language and tell me whether they see anything of interest. I want to use that feedback to decide whether I should keep Spiral for my own use because doing the documentation is a burden and being the only user of a language means I do not have to worry about my hacking on the language breaking anyone else's code.

Though I do not have enough material to cover the Cuda backend just yet, the [tensor](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language#5-tensors-and-structural-reflection) in Spiral is a marvel of engineering and solves one of the main challenges I had in making a library in F# - that of not having access to a generic tensor class.

The other main challenge Spiral solves is seamless language interop with Cuda and the writing of generic kernels.

It does not quite solve the issue of managing of GPU memory, but that is more of a platform issue. GPU memory needs to be bound to the GC and there is not much Spiral can do about that.

I believe in Spiral. I do not think that the way of monolithic frameworks is the way to go forward and what Spiral offers is the ability to create a high quality ML library that is integrated with the rest of the language.

There is no real alternative to a language like Spiral for this sort of thing - either Spiral become popular or somebody makes a language like Spiral that becomes popular, or the ML community will be glued to monolithic non-composable frameworks until that happens.

ML is troublesome - if it was not for GPUs maybe the current language designs would have sufficed, but now it is time for an overhaul. I am throwing Spiral into the ring as an example of what should come.",32,7,False,self,,,,,

**Original post**

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/66rriz/d_rnns_are_much_faster_in_pytorch_than_tensorflow/) claiming the opposite. But in my case (using CPU, not GPU) pytorch is three times slower (a relevant [discussion](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/is-lstm-in-pytorch-3-times-slower-compared-to-tensorflow-or-am-i-doing-it-wrong/11962) with no response from developers so far).

* pytorch time (1000 iterations): 265s
* tensorflow time (1000 iterations): 77s

[[the code]](https://gist.github.com/idavydov/1060b3fae833af436cdad11913c9e7e1)

Same datatype (float32), latest versions, even compiling pytorch from git does not improve things much.

Any suggestions on how to improve the code? Perhaps I'm doing it wrong.

P.S. By the way, eager at the moment is [15 times slower](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15952) than tensorflow.",8,8,False,self,,,,,

I've come to the conclusion that a capsule network, once trained, works very similarly to a Hough transform. Instead of accumulating votes in a 2 dimensional space on the location of objects based on hand-crafted features (such as a circle detector) with built-in geometric transformatiosn, the Capsule network learns these features based on data, while simultaneously learning the geometric relationships of how those features should align.  the accumulator exists in a higher-dimensional, abstract space, instead of a simple geometric one, but the voting accumulation happens similarly between capsules.  When there is vector consensus, a capsule fires, just like a pixel lights up in an accumulator.

Would this be a proper way of approaching the workings of capsule networks?",3,15,False,self,,,,,

In Tom's excellent rebuttal (https://twitter.com/tdietterich/status/950053197179109377), I came along a line that I did not quite understand: ""Training using REINFORCE overcomes limits of fixed depth BPTT""

How does REINFORCE do so? Could someone point me to a reference where this is explicitly being used?

I didn't have to get that data, and I didn't have to make sure they were all in numbers, that was just magically done for me before I started the assignments. If I had to code a neural network now with my own data, I would have completely no idea how to get data or how to put it into numbers that I would need before it can be put through a NN. Also, for the core math parts of the algorithm themselves, I was basically told what to do in the assignment instructions. I was told the exact equation i had to write in, and I just pythonized that. That isn't hard and doesn't seem to require much thinking. Also I was told exactly which equation to type next, and which variables to plug into each equation. If I didn't have this, I would have no idea what order to put the equations in, or which variable to pass to them and why. All I was doing was reading the instructions and plugging in the variables they told me, I hardly understood why I was doing what I was doing all through the programming assignments.

Why is it like this? Why does coursera make it so ridiculously easy to pass these assignments because you're literally copying the equations word for word and being told the order to put them, the order of functions to call, and what variables to put in. You don't even need to understand why the order and variables and equations are what they are to pass this, because coursera is telling you the whole thing. But when you pass these, they make it seem like you're ""such an expert"" in machine learning. No, you can pass these things just by being a good instruction-reader and understanding high-school level algebraic concepts. I aced every assignment and still feel like I know nothing, and I know I would be completely lost in coding up a DNN if I had to do it on my own, WITHOUT coursera telling me every single instruction in order.",20,8,False,self,,,,,

Most of us take notes when working through a paper, or a concept. Then we make use of  these notes when writing our own papers or software.

I feel that notes are most effective when the medium you use to write them is *expressive* (so you can write down equations / diagrams easily), as well as *searchable*, so you can review your own notes easily. What note taking methods have been useful for you? Feel free to go into as much detail and reasoning as you'd like.

Personally I haven't found a solution that is ideal. I find that I never search through my physical notebooks, and I feel limited and slowed down trying to write in Jupyter notebooks.

Current algorithms are only a manual approximation of what could be done using machine learning. My idea was to train a model using data from existing (manually produced) cartographic maps. An interesting paper on this topic is [here](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/864/full.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y).

However, the problem is this: Maps that go into print production usually receive some form of manual cartography. A neural network will never be as good as a human. So what I am doing is (for each label) saving the manual edits into a separate file. This means that I am not saving the whole map, but only the manual edits made by the cartographer. The goal is for the map to be ""reproducible"", i.e. I need to be able to open the map with the same configuration after a few years, apply the manual corrections again and receive the same map (in terms of label placement). This makes it possible to easily update the map (for addition / removal of labels) without manually editing all labels all over again.

Now, how do you determine the initial positions for the labels? The initial algorithm I wrote just places the labels (let's say: labels for a road) on the first two points of the line. Then the cartographer manually moves the label to the correct position and rotation. 

To keep this work to a minimum, I thought of using a neural network and train it on existing maps (using classifications such as text size, importance, etc.). But in order for maps to be reproducible in this way, the initial positioning algorithm has to be stable - if you give it the same map data, it has to give the same output. So my question is if it is possible to construct a neural network that can be ""paused"" or ""versioned"", i.e. I can tell the cartographer, ""these manual edits were done with generation 2.000.000"" - if he loads the trained model, would it yield the same results, i.e. would the labeling be stable? Or is it truly a ""black box"" where you never know exactly what you're going to get?

This is not regarding any software or frameworks, just a hypothetical question if it would be possible, from the way that neural networks work.",9,2,False,self,,,,,

This is an update to the previous post I made that had an animation that only did a forward pass:

[You can check that out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7bxdyv/p_created_a_plotting_function_using_matplotlib/)

In this video I show a little bit about how it works and what each aspect of the graph is showing. I updated it so that the connections between edges is shown in green if the weight is positive and red if the weight is negative. The thickness of the line shows the intensity of the value so a largely negative weight will be shown as a very thick red line. 

You can check out the code on
[Github](https://github.com/ryanchesler/NN-Plot)
it definitely isn't the prettiest but it's my first time working with matplotlib and I'm open to suggestions or improvements. For the most part right now all you need to do is record the weights and layer values in the correct formats and then pass it through to the function.

https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/08/12/lstm-backprop/

I implemented ADAM from the research paper to optimize it
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980

But I'm not sure I'm using a stochastic objective function as I'm computing the gradient for each item in the training sequence. Would that just be a batch size of 1?

Here is the stack overflow post
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48235392/lstm-in-numpy-loss-is-going-down-but-is-it-working-also-how-do-i-sample

script.py on the github is printing out the average loss for each training epoch. It can be seen decreasing by about half but seems to get stuck there.
The loop continues until convergence but not only do I not know how to test for convergence but the loss seems to stay pretty high so I don't think it is converging anyway. The convergence analysis in the ADAM paper wen't over my head. 

lstm.py uses a slightly different notation system than the guide above. For feedforward in the cell state the guide uses h(gate) but I use (gate)t (gate at timestep t.
ct_ and ht_ are the hidden state ht, and cell state c from the previous timestep. I know there is also a ct gate activation but I was trying to make a distinction between the cell state gate activation and the fully activated cell state. 

The notation in cell backprop is similar, except the guide writes dh(gate) for the gate activation and I just write d(gate), notice that dhc is replaced with dct while dc remains the same. 

I was hoping the community could help me verify that my model is a correct LSTM, also I don't know how to sample from the model and generate text.

[D],https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7qdwb5/is_it_possible_to_train_the_value_output_in_a/,Zeta_36,1515957449,"I've been working for a while in this kind of AZ projects. I started even this project some months ago: https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero

And I have a doubt I'd like to ask you. It's about the training of the value output. If I backprop the value output always with an integer (-1, 0, or 1) the NN should quickly be stuck in a local minimal function ignoring the input and always returning the mean of this 3 values (in this case 0). I mean, as soon as the NN learn to return always near 0 values ignoring the input planes, there will be no more improvements since it will have a high accuracy value (&gt;25%) almost intermediately after some steps.

In fact I did a toy experiment to confirm this. As I mention the NN was unable to improve after reaching 33% accuracy (~0.65 loss in mean square). And this has sense if the NN is always returning 0 (very near zero values). Imagine we introduce a dataset of 150 games: ~50 are -1, ~50 are 0 and ~50 are 1. If the NN learns to say always near 0, we get an instant loss of (mse): 100/150 ~ 0.66 and an accuracy of ~33% (1/3).

How the hell did DeepMind to train the value network with just 3 integer values to backpropagate??
I thought the tournament selection (the evaluation worker) was implicated in helping to overcome this local minimum (stabilizing the training), but in its last paper they say they removed the eval process (??)...so, I don't really know what to think.

I don't know neither if the self-play can help in this issue. In last term we are still back-propagating an integer from a domain of just 3 values.

Btw, you can see in our project in https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero we got some ""good"" results (in a supervised way) but I suspect it was all thanks to the policy network guiding the MCTS exploration (with a value function returning always near 0 values).

For a wrong answer ( x^i , y^i ), we only know that the output of f( x^i ) *shouldn't* be y^i . How can we incorporate this knowledge into the regression?

We can add to the loss function a term -( y^i - yhat^i )^2 rewarding the model for yielding results far away from the negative examples. But then we'd need to somehow clamp/saturate this reward and add regularization to avoid sending the model output to infinity. This adds hyperparameters and doesn't have any clear theoretical justification.

For classification problems, [it seems straightforward](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/255603/how-do-i-use-negative-examples-in-addition-to-positive-ones-for-training-a-mul) to incorporate negative examples, but it seems more subtle and difficult for regression problems.

Naively speaking, the concept of online reinforcement learning sounds very much like how human learns, and it's very effective for tasks like stochastic games. Since it performs an update at each timestep, the agent may be more robust under the circumstances such that the current state is relatively unfamiliar. As it was updated in the past ten or so timesteps which are close to the current timesteps, the agent is more adapted to the unfamiliar current states. Also, the weights of the agent may be considered to be conditioned on the past events in the same episode, which may alleviate the issue of LSTM and memory network, that is, they still has the limit on the extent to which they can remember the distant past events in the same episode. Furthermore, being able to update online probably makes the agent more sample-efficient, since they can be improved midst an episode that may contribute to a better subsequent performance in the same episode. The sparse reward issue may be dealt with by reward designing (which is essentially the simulator for reward only without relying on the presence of (sub)optimal agent). With this, AlphaZero-like MCTS may be used for ORL.  

Below, let's consider the continual case (a single episode with very large horizon) only, as a repetition of small horizon tasks like Pong can be cast to this case. The agent needs a large experience buffer D, to which we store most events observed so far. At each timestep, we obtain (s,a,r), store it to D, form a minibatch by sampling (s,a,r)'s from D and then update once. Note of the following:

- The sampling should favor the recent events over the past ones and the interesting events over the uninteresting ones (events with larger magnitude of reward over the smaller ones, or you can concurrently train a NN to quantify interestingness of (s,a,r)).   

- I believe the causality information should somehow be incorporated in this online learning, and the recalled information should be causally concentrated. Note that states, actions and interestingness of (s,a,r) pairs in a small neighborhood of timestep t tend to be similar to each other. For example, a minibatch may consist of sub-minibatches like [(s^t , a^t , r^t , t),(s^t+1 , a^t+1 , r^t+1 , t+1),...(s^t' , a^t' , r^t' , t')], where the last component t conveys the causality information to be utilized in the loss function.

- The recent events are extremely important, so (s,a,r,t) of the past 50 or so timesteps should be always be in a part of the minibatch to be updated on.

This way, the batch isn't too small, and the agent isn't overfitted to the recent events. So anyway, what makes ORL not mainstream? Are the currently prominent benchmarks not useful for ORL?

The primary requirement was a system of fully autonomous underwater drones which could map the shoreline and inland waterways of a post tsunami AO.

My assumptions for the operating environment ran like this.

1.High concentration of varied debris/flotsam extending a 1/2 mile from the shoreline and increasing in severity as the drone moves inland

2.Wide variety of physical, electrical, and chemical hazards

3.Turbulent waters

For a fully autonomous solution, a drone maneuvering on its own using a ML/DL algorithm seems like the only answer. However, the algorithm would have to be extremely sophisticated. The drone is operating in a 3d environment with debris moving in potentially different directions on all axis relative to it. The drone itself is also moving, and is being influenced by currents in the water. The drone may have imperfect information about the hazards around it. My solution proposed multiple multibeam sonar modules stationed around the drone to give it a rough 360 degree picture of its environment, but debris/obstacles could obfuscate other hazards (i.e. a large piece of cardboard concealing a rebar pipe).

The drone would have to be able to identify a massive range of obstacles, including electrical or chemical hazards. It may also have to make decisions about which hazards are more dangerous, a blob of plastic may do more damage than a steel pipe. Beyond maneuvering, the drone would have to make many different operational decisions (what path to take, when to surface, when to return for repairs/recharging ect).

So while a ML/DL solution seemed like what they were looking for, does a system actually exist today that tackles a problem of comparable complexity?

I am currently trying to learn how reinforcement learning works by experimenting with simple test cases. I was hoping someone could help me out with my implementation. I have A very simple example/case, where the objective is to follow the player *in the horizontal direction*:

https://codepen.io/Samid737/pen/eyLNva

The position is directly updated when the agent acts. You can see that it learns to follow pretty quickly, but if I introduce velocity, I cannot really get A sensible result. Here is the same example, but instead the agent also observes and moves using velocity:

https://codepen.io/Samid737/pen/qpMoLo

Why does the agent behave so differently if you introduce this extra variable? Is the agent failing to learn? The reward scheme is the exact same, could that be the problem?

Also, in general, would it be possible to re-iterate the learning process, by re-using and adapting A pre-trained agent to A different environment. For example, in the above case, the agent learns in X direction (AGENT X). If I switch everything to the Y direction, modify the observed states to Y variables, then preload AGENT X, would it become AGENT Y?  

*EDIT: confirmed by training the first example for 2-3 minutes, saving the neural net, switching x's to y's, preloaded AGENTX and it works in Y:*

Any advice is greatly appreciated and if you need more details on the example code please let me know and I will do my best to clarify.

I have been trying really hard to land a research/company internship in ML for the past few weeks, but professors and companies just don't seem to care. They seem to only want PhD's / Master's etc.

I am really into this field and I compete seriously in DL/ML Competitions ( Kaggle, Numerai ) and I have a bunch of projects in DL applied to CV and NLP. I have also gone through fast.ai and cs231n pretty rigourosly. And I work as a research assistant in my school, applying Deep Learning in CV. What more can I do to get noticed? Any internship program suggestions?

PS : If you're hiring, I am happy to send my resume over!

I'm a CS student, new to ML. I'm trying to study a solution for a problem I was asked to solve. It's kinda based on the Travelling Salesman problem, basically there's a geographic zone that a vehicle needs to cover (the vehicle should travel through the streets of his assigned zone), optimizing the route in relation to a fuel consumption function.
My formulation of the problem consists of a graph &lt;V,E&gt; where V = intersection of streets in the zone of interest, E = street which connects two+ nodes.
Edges have weights based on the street actual length.
The vehicle starts from the deposit (initial node) and returns to the deposit after visiting all nodes. There are special nodes which model fuel refill stations. 
Can you suggest some papers I should read in order to approach this problem in a more structured way? Do you have any suggestions and or concerns about my formulation of the problem?
I have a lot of missing data, for example, I don't know how big the zones are, or what is the granularity of the nodes in the graph (since a graph is basically a representation of a map portion)

With regular data (N &gt; P), you use VIF which solves the problem nicely, but in the N &lt;&lt; P case, VIF won't work since the formula has 1 - R_squared in the denominator and that will be zero in the N &lt;&lt; P case. And you cannot use a correlation matrix because it is possible for collinearity to exist between 3 or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation.

The only solution I've ever come across is using dimensionality reduction to compress the predictor space to N &gt; P, then do VIF (although am not sure how you would map back to the original predictor space to drop the offending predictors).

For this trial, I chose ""The Book of Kings"" ([Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BwAinyMWdS16jC%2BZwtaJx%2Fw%3D%3D)), which is a long epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi around 1000 CE. Shahnameh is the national epic of Greater Iran. Consisting of some 50,000 ""distichs"" or couplets (two-line verses), Shahnameh is also the world's longest epic poem written by a single poet.

 Verses in Shahnameh have two important properties:

Every verse has two rhyming lines 
All lines have the same rhythm. In more technical terms Persian poetry is quantitative, and the metrical patterns are made of long, short and overlong syllables. Shahnameh particularly uses a pattern in the form ""u   u   u   u "" where u stands for short and dash stands for long patterns. For instance, each line, from rhythm perspective will sound like this: ""you don't care, I don't care, we don't care, at all"" (Ta tan tan, Ta tan tan, Ta tan tan, Ta tan)
I trained a three-layer LSTM models in Tensorflow with 400 cells on each layer and generated new text based on this model., The result was very interesting and as unreasonable as it should be. The model learned to generate verses (two lines) with correct words, rhyme, and rhythm with a decent grammar and almost no mistake like this:

We proposed the use of a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) approach to created datasets of standardized nail images. It has been used to generate training datasets of approx. 50,000 images, which were then be able to fine-tune the ResNet-152 and VGG-19 models. This automated R-CNN approach increased the accuracy of CNNs. We then performed the CNN training with the datasets labeled by three dermatologists. In diagnosing onychomycosis, the CNNs trained with these 50,000 images demonstrate a better diagnostic accuracy than all dermatologists that participated to this study.

So far, AI's performance has been comparable to specialists in the medical field, and this is the first study showing that AI has overwhelmed the experts, as far as I know.

An acquaintance a year or two ago was messing around with neural style transfer ([Gatys et al 2016](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf ""Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks"")), experimenting with some different approaches, like a tile-based GPU implementation for making large poster-size transfers, or optimizing images to look different using a two-part loss: one to encourage being like the style of the style image, and a negative one to penalize having content like the source image; this is unstable and can diverge, but when it works, looks cool. (Example: [""The Great Wave"" + Golden Gate Bridge](https://68.media.tumblr.com/9e3b73ea6c2fb0348d75a77dcf5af168/tumblr_ots4zgw3ce1uy4j3wo1_1280.jpg). I tried further [Klimt-ising it](https://deepart.io/img/tMN8gQf61/) but at that point too much has been lost.)

## VGG worked best for style transfer

One thing they noticed was that using features from a pretrained [ImageNet VGG-16/19 CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556 ""'Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition', Simonyan &amp; Zisserman 2014"") from 2014 (4 years ago), like the original Gatys paper did, worked much better than anything else; indeed, almost any set of 4-5 layers in VGG would provide great features for the style transfer optimization to target (as long as they were spread out and weren't exclusively bottom or top layers), while using more modern resnets (resnet-50) or GoogLeNet Inception v1 didn't work - it was hard to find sets of layers that would work at all and when they did, the quality of the style transfer was not as good.
Interestingly, this appeared to be true of VGG CNNs trained on the [MIT Places scene recognition database](http://places.csail.mit.edu/) too, suggesting there's something architectural going on which is not database specific or peculiar to those two trained models.
And their attempt at an upscaling CNN modeled on [Johnson et al 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155 ""Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"")'s VGG-16 for CIFAR-100 worked well too.

## Everyone uses VGG

Indeed, VGG is used pervasively through style transfer implementations &amp; research beyond what one would expect from cargo-culting or copy-paste, even in applications as exotic as inferring images from human fMRI scans ([Shen et al 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/30/240317 ""Deep image reconstruction from human brain activity"")).
This surprising because 4 years in DL is a long time, and the newer CNNs outperform VGG at everything else like image classification or object localization ([Tapa Ghosh](https://twitter.com/semiDL/status/954173261436239873) disagrees on object localization) rendering VGG obsolete due to its large model size (much of which comes from the 3 large fully-connected layers at the top) &amp; slowness &amp; poor accuracy, and style transfer itself has made major advances in, among other things, going from days on a desktop to generate a new image to being capable of realtime on smartphones. For example, [SqueezeNet](https://github.com/lizeng614/SqueezeNet-Neural-Style-Pytorch) outperforms VGG in every way, but its style transfer results are distinctly worse (but extremely fast!). Although this VGG-specificity appears to be folklore among practitioners, this is not something I have seen noticed in neural style transfer papers; indeed, the review [Jing et al 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04058 ""Neural Style Transfer: A Review"") explicitly says that other models work fine, but their reference is to [Johnson's list of models](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/wiki/Using-Other-Neural-Models) where almost every single model is (still) VGG-based and the ones which are not come with warnings (NIN-Imagenet: ""May need heavy tweaking to achieve reasonable results""; Illustration2vec: ""Best used with anime content...Be warned that it can sometimes be difficult to avoid the burn marks that the model sometimes creates""; PASCAL VOC FCN-32s: ""Uses more resources than VGG-19, but can produce better results depending on your style and/or content image."" etc). 

## Hypotheses

Some possible explanations:

1. VGG is so big that it is incidentally capturing a lot of information that the other models discard and accidentally generalizing better despite worse task-specific performance. (Do resnets in general do transfer-learning worse, compared to earlier CNNs, than would be expected based on their superior task-specific performance?)

    but while VGG is giant compared to other ImageNet models, 500M vs &lt;50MB ([Keras table](https://keras.io/applications/#documentation-for-individual-models)), most of this appears to be coming from the FC layers rather than the convolutions being sampled (leaving 58/80MB for the rest), so where is the supposed knowledge being stored? Nor does VGG appear to have tame internal dynamics lacking in other models - the layer average norms differ greatly, and rescaling appears to be unnecessary (neither they nor Johnson needed to do that like the Bethge lab did).

    on the gripping hand, could the FC layers in some way be forcing the lower convolutions to be different in terms of abstractions than equivalent convolutions in later less-FC-heavy models?
2. resnets are unrolled iteration/shallow ensembles: the features do exist but they are too spread out to be pulled out easily and the levels of abstraction are all mixed up - instead of getting a nice balance of features from the bottom and top, they're spread out wildly between layer #3 and #33 and #333 etc. While VGGs, being relatively shallow and modular and having no residual connections or other special tricks to smuggle raw information up the layers, are forced to create more of a clearcut hierarchical pyramid of abstractions.

    Here there may be some straightforward way to better capture resnet knowledge; [Pierre Richemond](https://twitter.com/KloudStrife/status/954313424103727105) suggestions

    &gt; Probably ResNets feature maps need to be summed depthwise before taking the Gram matrix. By that logic, one'd think DenseNets should work better than Resnets but worse than VGG (due to gradient flows from earlier layers).
3. Residual connections themselves somehow mess up the optimization procedure by affecting properties like independence of features, with ""blurring"" from layers so easily passing around activations, suggests [Kyle Kastner](https://twitter.com/kastnerkyle/status/954174828881305602) (this might be the same thing as ""resnets have too many layers &amp; split up features"")
4. VGG's better performance is due to not downsampling aggressively, doing so only after two convolutions and then max pooling

    In this interpretation, GoogLeNet fails because it downsamples in the first layer.

### Testing hypotheses

What tests could be done?

1. train much bigger resnet/DenseNets to see if expanding model capacity helps; alternately, retrain much smaller VGGs to create models which are comparable in parameters to see if the gap goes away. If a small VGG can't do better style transfer than an equal-sized resnet, that suggests there is no special mystery.

    Add/remove FC layers from retrained VGG and resnet models. Does that lead to large gains/losses in quality?
2. experiment with different ways of picking or summing layers to generate features; possibly brute force, trying out a large number of subsets until one works.

    Another approach would be to try to remove layers entirely: resnets are resistant to deleting random layers, or one could try model distillation to train a shallow but wide resnet from a SOTA deep resnet. With similar parameters, it should perform just as well, but the layer features should be more compressed and easier to find a good set.
3. Model distillation again but for an equivalent resnet minus all residual connections? I don't know if that's trainable at all.
4. train competing models but with VGG-style initial layers.

Fixing this limitation to VGG, or showing that current resnets actually do work well and this folklore is false, could speed up style transfer training by replacing VGG with a smaller faster model, or a better one, and might give some interesting insights into what CNNs are learning &amp; how that's affected by their architecture.",30,123,False,self,,,,,

So I started reading the paper ""[Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04933)"" again. I find that I don't agree with some of the main conclusions of this paper. 

My main issue is this - this paper only talks about flatness measures of individual minima while not talking much about relative flatness (and claiming otherwise). 

In Section 4.1, there is this statement - 

&gt; Given that every minimum
&gt; has an infinitely large region (volume-wise) in which the
&gt; error remains approximately constant, that means that every
&gt; minimum would be infinitely flat according to the volume
&gt; \epsilon-flatness. Since all minima are equally flat, it is not possible
&gt; to use volume \epsilon-flatness to gauge the generalization property
&gt; of a minimum.

This statement makes the false equivalence that all minima with volumes approaching infinity have the same volume (""equally flat""). This is obviously false. Similar statements are made at the end of each such proof for different flatness measures. 

------- &lt;math&gt; -------

From the terminology of the proof in section 4.1, let `v_1` and  `v_2` be volumes of `L_inf` balls in the regions `C_1` and `C_2` around two local minima with different flatness levels. Important: Let the `L_inf` balls be the **largest** that can be accommodated in the respective regions`C`. That is, if the first minimum is flatter, `v_1 &gt; v_2`. It is obvious from the proof that the ratio of volumes will always remain `v_1 / v_2` despite the applied transformation.

-------&lt;\math&gt;-------

Section 5.1 offers evidence of changing relative flatness levels for toy functions (Figure 5), and not neural nets from what I understand. Appendix A presents an example of arbitrarily changing the flatness ranking, but there doesn't seem to be any constraint there which ensures ""observational equivalence"" (i.e.; the neural net mapping not changing). There is no evidence presented whether such drastic re-parameterizations are possible for neural nets. 

If this is true, then this means that this paper offers no counter-evidence for the hypothesis that if one minimum of a neural net is flatter than another (with similar loss value), it will generalize better. The only statement made is that absolute measures of flatness mean very little, as they aren't invariant to simple re-parameterizations. 

However the paper claims 

&gt; ... we show how the geometry
&gt; of the associated parameter space can alter the ranking
&gt; between prediction functions when considering several measures
&gt; of flatness/sharpness

Please let me know if there is a flaw in my argument anywhere, or whether I am missing anything fundamental. It's also possible that I have misunderstood the paper entirely. Apologies for the long post.",9,14,False,self,,,,,

After a bit of research, it seems that the most advanced real-time human pose estimation that is publicly available are Vnect and OpenPose (for single RGB cameras).

I am in search for datasets of 3D pose from RGB sequences (PoseTrack seems to be what I need), but would also be interested in RGBD datasets.

Do you have any recommendations on the topic? My goal would be to make a quick and dirty model that could take a sequence of RGB frames and output the 3D pose for the frame. It seems this area is quite not solved yet, tough it is pretty promising for futures applications (maybe for VR?).

Are there some solutions that I don't know about? Should I give up on it and use a Kinect?

I am working on a text based game, that uses a simple, yet dynamic world structure at the back-end, and uses text to describe the interactions. The problem is, the text ends up seeming too....bland. There are only so many variations I can write, and they end up repeating after a few iterations.

Then I dived into deep learning. I learnt about RNN text generators, about word embeddings, and hit upon an idea.

How about I write some sample sentences,

&gt; You slash your sword, and the orc tumbles.

Covert them to vectors, and feed them to an RNN that goes over a corpus of text (Fantasy literature), to look for sentences with similar sequences of vectors. It then produces similar meaning sentences, using variations of the used words and even adding some words of its own, to create potentially infinite versions of the same meaning sentences.

My question is, surely something like this has been done before? If so, I could be guided by the example. Even if not, how do you think should I proceed? Is the idea even practical?

So I'm a .NET developer been doing it for a few years now. AI has always been a seeming interest of mine. Now I've finally found a ""Simple"", enjoyable and ""practical"" use for building a system which could utilize a form of Machine Learning.

So to give some context; the project is to classify outliers in a large amount of program errors we get on a day to day basis. 

So, we'll get roughly 100 or so just general errors ranging from ""The phone number you used doesn't exist"", these are what I'd like to call general errors, or noise. 

Then we get other major errors; now these are the ones we'd like to 'flag' - the outliers in the noise. These type of errors can be things such as Unhanded Exception. 

Now; I'd like to start building my training set with roughly 500-100 records tagging each error as either 'Noise' or an Outlier. 

Now this is where I start to get discouraged. I start thinking to myself okay. Me a human, I understand the context of each one of these errors. 

So, now I'm thinking ""Okay, so I need something which can understand the context of these errors"". With the training set hopefully I build a successful model which can start to flag some of these outliers.

But from here I don't really know where to go; I've started to going through this course [here](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers#why-use-it)

Which has been great thus far and really fits in with my learning style. I'm really not sure what type of algorithms would be best suited for something like this.

In my head, this small projects just seems like a spam filter for the errors which is great. 

My only thought here would be to use some form of a NLP to understand the context of the errors. 

So really, at this moment any advice would be great!

**My burning questions**

* Is this the right approach?
* Is just tagging data as an outlier/noise enough? Should I tag the data which something more meaningful?
* Maybe a different approach such as reducing the noise would be a better task? 


Thanks!

           image_label = [0 if label == -1 else 1 for label in image_label]

           self.celeba_labels.append(image_label)



2) Use them as sample labels (like mnist)

    sample_labels = self.celeba_labels[0:self.sample_num]



3) Use them as batch labels (like mnist)

This is to learn a game (not image processing) so we don't need millions of connections (much less a convolutional layer). Not only that, but such high dimensionality would likely to lead to overfitting, when the underlying function could probably be represented (in theory, anyway) with a couple hundred parameters. The challenge is the stochastic environment. Training a heuristic presents noise (especially early in the game) and, of course, good moves can lead to bad outcomes. 

(To get into the details, I'll be using standard optimization techniques to train a heuristic, and performance in the game itself for validation, to inform a genetic/evolutionary approach to feature selection and dimensionality reduction. We'll see if that approach works. One challenge is that I can't manually fiddle with learning rates for each network I create.)

You probably don't want to do a full second-order method on 10,000+ weights. (Inverting a 10k-by-10k matrix is expensive, and possibly not worth it in a stochastic environment.) But gradient descent is slow and requires a lot of fiddling with parameters (learning rate, momentum, etc.) and effectively never converges in a stochastic environment. So, I'd like to find something better than SGD if possible. 

What about this approach, though: use backpropagation (first-order) to send error signals through the network. With those error signals, use Newton's method at each node (&lt; 100 inputs) to update the weights. If these updates move too fast, then, instead of a learning rate, set a desired norm (say, normalize to |w|_2 = 0.1). 

Does this sound like a reasonable approach? Has anyone tried something like this? What were the results?",3,2,False,self,,,,,

The aim is to submit to NIPS 2018.

Currently when I do performance comparisons I've mostly used the basic Kaggle standbys - linear SVC, RBF-kernel SVC, kNN, RandomForest, and XGBoost. 

What kinds of algorithms would you (as a reviewer) expect to see comparisons with in this problem space? And are there any datasets that stand out as things you'd want to see (keeping in mind that the primary claim will be about performance in the very low data regime).

Snakes compete for food and employ various strategies to force their opponent into a fatal move. The question is, theoretically, could a version of AlphaZero be used for this competitive Snake game?

Basically, we are aiming at protein folding problem. This is the one of the components of a possible algorithm that predicts 3d structure of a protein given its sequence. The subproblem this paper tries to solve is: you have a lot of candidate structures of a protein, they are all wrong, however you have to sort them according to closeness to the unknown real structure. This problem is an old one, but the main contribution of this paper is that now it learns directly from 3D densities, so one can account for electrostatics and water distribution without constructing features from them and loosing information.

I dont't feel like I am overfitting as the network performs very well on the validation set. But to me it seems like the network learned to recognize synthetic samples because there are so many and doesn't actually know how to evaluate the real ones.

While the features are computed in the same way for training and inference data, the actual distribution for each feature is different.
That means, most features during inference have an absolute mean of ~1.0 - 2.0 instead of 0.0, after they have been standardized using the mean/std that I computed on the training dataset.

Does anyone here have any experience on similar transfer learning problems?

From my understanding, in a 2 dimensional input vector, a bias's role to is adjust the y-intercept. The equation of the line that a perceptron develops can be written as

&gt; For input (x, y):  
&gt; y = -(weight_1/weight_2)*x - (bias/weight_2)

From this equation we can see that not only the *bias* but *weight_2* also contributes to the y-intercept.

I have a dream.  I run a local cleanup group that focuses on collecting nails from burnt pallets and other waste at our river.  This is a major problem.  So far I have picked up 6,500lbs of nails.  I have built 2 magnetic sweepers.  They are custom built with the strongest magnets possible.  So here is the dream:  When the nails hit the stainless steel tray ((the bottom)(the magnets sit in side the tray and swings out to drop the nails from the bottom)  they make a very distinctive sound.  Once the tray has been saturated with nails the sounds dissipate.  It is then time to dump the nails in collection pile.  This is very labor intensive volunteer work.  It is easy to identify hot spots of nails due to the sound it makes clanging against the tray. Is this type of audio input good enough to train an AI to cover a large area and identify nail hot spots? The robot part seems easy enough... its the training the AI that has me lost.  Is there anyone who might have ideas on how I can do this or help with the project?  Once it works on one then we can scale it up.  Illegal dumping and pallet burning is a nation wide issue that caused countless flat tires, injuries to wildlife and pets.  ",31,80,False,self,,,,,

[x-post Artificial Intelligence],https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7tfgrq/d_possible_largescale_sophisticated_ai_network/,tawjmp,1517086007,"Forward: I'm a software engineer, have no need/desire to make YouTube videos or spam. I'm a nerd, and seeing this fascinated me. This is the first time I've seen a possible deep-learning algorithm implemented in such scale, and one of the most successful spam bots I've seen in years.

TL:dr Weird network of Russian/Arabic/English children videos. Many separate channels, some of which are being shut down by YouTube, but most of which are able to pull 20 million views in &lt; 1-week. Most of the videos are of the same people, and the comments section are FULL of A.I. generated comments. There's a few things in particular that stood out to me:

I think they may be using large data to make and implement the videos. Each one from different channels are displayed in different ways, with different thumbnails. There all targeted toward children, which most people know are a large-view, repeat-click audience. I think they may be using deep-learning to find other successful videos with X-criteria. Some of the channels only have the Russians, others have a large variety of children's video's. The thumbnails are perfect implementation to the kind of videos 5-13 year-old's would click on. The video content is usually the same if it's the Russians, but in different orders and times.

Some have comments disabled, some have comments sections full of AI. Most comments seem really similar to the Computer-phile video: /watch?v=XyMdpcAPnZc It seems really obvious to me that this is an AI, and not just a simple crawling bot posting copy and pasted comments from other videos. Alot of AI type errors seem to arise, with occasional garbage-type comments. Alot of similar emoji's, comments in 5 or so languages, the English ones being kind of out of order, same user posting 5 or so really weird comments, and the user's actually conversating in really strange ways to each other.

The fact that this appeared in my recommendation means some sophisticated SEO work. SEO was easy long ago, but it was mostly associated with spamer's trying to game the ""system"". Today it's more synonymous with trying to make sure YouTube's algorithm understands what your content is about, and that its presented in the right way. Once you click on one of the videos, all the recommended on the right turn into the many many channels they use. Maybe the change in language makes it more difficult for YouTube algorithms to pinpoint? Either way it has perfected what is bringing views, I'm not sure if it's bot views that's causing it to register as ""viral"", or if it's really ""cornered"" YouTube's algorithms in a way that hasn't been done in some time.

The sheer scale of these videos. So many channels, videos, comments, and accounts. This makes me think of how they get through anti-bot implementations but more on that on 5. So obviously these videos are designed with a specific purpose in mind. Weird, foreign, bright high-contrasting appealing thumbnails, alot of stuff that people share to there friends with a ""wtf"" attached. The foreign languages, and comments that are praising the video further this. Even still, 20 million views in matter of a week, how is something that huge not red-flagged? I did some IMO back in college, never did much with it, mostly just read alot on blackhatworld and what not. From what I know, they track where user's come from, what brought them there, level's of normal engagement, comments, likes/dislikes, what kind of content, location of content, location of viewers, viral-ity, among many others.

How can so many bots, bypass so many different types of security's? The captcha's, IP tracking, and so many other things. The fact that some of these channels are older then a year, means that the bots consistently keep the level of engagement that's acceptable in Google's algorithms. Google does not release any of this data. So this leads me back to number 1, that they have pulled massive amounts of data-sets to implement these.

I am specializing in machine learning, I begin in the fall. I've been saying for years that this territory is so much more then people imagine. I read the other day about the AI-fake porn reddit that's become so popular, which seems like it's straight out of an episode of Black Mirror. So I'm curious, does this mean that machine-learning is now heading for the masses? Spamming is usually a very-low entry level in cost. But to run this large of a network seems to me that it would require a decent amount of money, and perhaps even a large organization? Just seems like a lot of data collection, processing, and ""faking"" human behavior. I also have a hunch of it being an evolutionary neural net, there is a certain degree on polymorphism between all the content, and if the number 1 data-collection is true, I'm sure the succession of each different implementation is fed back into the next generation. I.e. kill off bottom performing 50%, and all channels shut down &lt; week, breed top 50%, all fitness judged on longevity, views, income, and reach.

So does AI like this render things like Captchas useless? Even the tracking of the ""I'm not a robot""? I feel like this is a big deal, more so then just a bunch of spammers flooding junk. Now it's AI vs AI, the same way wall-street is algorithm vs algorithm. I'm curious to see any other thoughts on this, and perhaps this network I've stumbled upon isn't as sophisticated as I think it is? Perhaps it's a hybrid on mixed user and bot interaction? Or a large network of mechanical turk type ""human-bots"". That only explains some though, cause I have a pretty good grasp on what AI generated text looks like, and those comments REALLY point that direction to me.

I really don't want to share these videos, as it just add's to the problem, but it's kind of hard to talk about without a source. So here are some of the ones I've found, these are links to the channel's themselves, so you don't actually give them any views if you stay on them. /channel/UC5SK4xqbIdgvW84SmTmpEug/featured /channel/UCEREgnbM4H1S6f5JG3IfMUw/featured /channel/UCBn0LGNo4e3EYucsEH9rg4g/featured /channel/UCRzo63EHjjE_PNrtAlmje-A /channel/UCMMIpxNLCGiRNyEtvkwV2IQ

I have no idea where to start on it, I want to make a self learning AI and set it up to play my favorite steam game Brawlhalla. 

The inputs and outputs are pretty simple I think, aside from visual stuff, it just needs to know that taking damage and losing lives is bad, and dealing damage and taking lives is good. And know how to press 9 different buttons equivalent to up, down, left, right, throw/pickup, light attack, heavy attack, dodge and jump.

I have around 10 hours each night that I could leave this running if I need to, but I want to be able to play against something as smart as I am (I'm pretty bad at this game) whenever, without having to worry about my bad internet connection.

I have done a bit of research, but each time I start to get close to what I think is what I want I cant comprehend it. Any help would be very much appreciated.

Edit: Would this be better marked discussion? I'm looking for help.

Edit 2: I found this, it seems a lot like what I'm looking for, just I need to figure out how I would make it learn, and how I would give it the different inputs. https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117 Also, I have noticed there are several AIs that will replicate what someone teaches it at first, I would be happy to do that as well.

Recently, I've been trying to figure out new and interesting ways to combine deep learning and finance (totally not for my master thesis or anything like that). I've read that CNN and their variations could be applied to predict financial things like stock prices to somewhat decent extent. 

What do you think about applying regional CNN to predict-stock prices. 

The idea is quite simple: instead of looking at the whole graph CNN would look at regions who express high heteroscedasticity or have a clear upwards or downwards trend. Based on the amount of differences expressed and how far these regions would be from our prediction point (I guess one could use something like euclidean distance). 


It's just a thought thought. Feel free to share any relevant research done on such topic and discuss whether this idea has any merit. I got an idea based on how such models as GARCH(1,1) is used instead of models like ARIMA to measure the volatility of an asset.

Apologies if I've missed a research that has covered this already. 

Also, this is my first post on machine learning and first on Reddit overall. Feel free to point out whether I missed something that should be included if I create another post.

Looking for insights.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7tlfxc/p_time_series_generation_with_recurrent/,Habzungrabt,1517159235,"I am trying to implement a GAN models that generates time series (sine waves in this case), conditioned to previous timesteps. I intend to evaluate if a generator trained using adversarial loss has any advantages over training using MSE, similar to [Lotter at al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06380).

I've started by training a LSTM model to generate sine waves, generating the next timestep  given previous timesteps. After only 500 epochs of training i started using the model output as input starting with 100 steps of the original sinewave i was able to generate over 500 steps of generated data.

After that i tried to model a GAN model using a LSTM as generator and discriminator. The generator receives a sequence of timesteps and generate the next one (I am not using the random variable since my previous timesteps are working as prior). The discriminator receives a sequence of timesteps as well as the true next timestep and the one generated. I concat the the true next with the sequence, as well as the generated next withe the sequency and input that on the discriminator. I have trained if this setup for over 10k epochs and the model is unable to converge to generate a sine when I start to feedback its output. If i try to use a mix of adversarial los and MSE as the reference I presented the model is able to converge, but I was realy expecting that for a simple problem as sine wave generation the adversarial loss would be enough. 

Do you have any insights on what I am missing?

There is one thing I am not sure about, and I hope somebody here can explain.

To my mind, in order to get a good evaluation of a method, you would need to run the learning process independently several times. However, in papers such as Rainbow RL, or the DQN paper, I cannot find any mention of how many times each experiment was run, if it was repeated at all.

The papers do mention, of course, that they run multiple testing episodes and average the results for each single evaluation, but this would only account for stochasticity in the evaluation of an already trained agent. It does not account for stochastic elements in training. The papers do, of course, apply the method to several different atari games, so maybe that would help, I don't know.

Can somebody elucidate? Is it a common practice to only run learning once these days? Or if learning is being run multiple times in these recent papers, then how many?",16,13,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure what are steps should I take to achieve this. the NN ONLY need to suggest links when its necessary. 



I know there is LSTM involved in this. the problem is I couldn't find any research paper related to this type of neural network.



if anyone could help me out here that would be great.

I have 2 questions regarding that.

1. Are we talking about microcolumns (common input, one output) or hypercolumns (a bundle of microcolumns, common input, several outputs, one for each microcolumn)? And in case it's microcolumns, is there any talk of hypercapsules yet?

2. What is the internal structure of the capsules? Do they also have a layered inner structure, like the cortical columns do? How many neurons?

I will add that I'm asking merely from an informed bystander point of view, so please don't get more technical than is necessary :)

i am currently trying to get back into Tensorflow because I want to use Edward for my Master thesis. I played around with it in 2016 but seemingly all of the API has changed since then.

Then for the following layer, the deformation of a pixel can be max x, as every point in the output feature map of the deformation convolution layer has a receptive field of x (assuming no previous layers)
