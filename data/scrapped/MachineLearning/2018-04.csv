In the paper, it says that the 1st and 2nd moment ""vectors"" are initialized to 0 - are these actually matrices in most implementations, with an entry for each weight or bias parameter?

The reason I ask is that I have a matrix of weight gradients at a given layer, for example, so should I have an entry in the 1st and 2nd moment matrices for each weight? I'm trying to figure out if I need to store an additional matrix for these moment values to be used in the updates (and maybe even an additional two matrices for the bias-corrected moment estimates?) If this is the case, would updates for a given weight use its corresponding entries in the other matrices? Thanks in advance for any clarification.

Specifically, TensorCore.

Are there any frameworks that leverage them?

Could there ever be?

Won't fp16 compromise performance?

Haven't newer architectures moved beyond dense layers and matrix multiplication that these TensorCores try to do?

If there is no practical use, then why does NVIDIA continue to put it up on a pedestal?

The new DGX-2 is supposedly a ""2-petaFLOPS GPU"".

As far as I can see from all real-world benchmarks, the V100 (or it's consumer equivalent Titan V) is ~30-40% faster than the 1080Ti.

If so, that puts the V100 at not more than 16 TFlops and hence, the DGX-2 at a maximum of 256 TFlops.

That's fast.

But it ain't ""2-petaFLOPS GPU"" fast!

I wanted to know about the state of the art on satellite image segmentation.   

Last year Kaggle organised a contest called [DSTL Satellite Image Feature Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection) and I went through the blog posts of the 1st, 3rd and 4th placed solutions :  

* [1st place solution](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/26/dstl-satellite-imagery-competition-1st-place-winners-interview-kyle-lee/)
* [3nd place solution](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/05/09/dstl-satellite-imagery-competition-3rd-place-winners-interview-vladimir-sergey/)
* [4th place solution](https://blog.deepsense.ai/deep-learning-for-satellite-imagery-via-image-segmentation/)  

This year Spacenet organised another similar challenge called [Spacenet Road Detection and Routing Challenge](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/Competitions/Competition3.html) and I went through a couple of blog posts about that as well :
   
* [1st place solution](https://i.ho.lc/winning-solution-for-the-spacenet-challenge-joint-learning-with-openstreetmap.html)
* [NVIDIA official blog](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/solving-spacenet-road-detection-challenge-deep-learning/)   

When you go through the solutions you will find that almost all of them use U-Nets with different augmentation techniques. Here are a couple summary blog posts on natural image segmentation approaches : 

* [A Brief History of CNNs in Image Segmentation: From R-CNN to Mask R-CNN](https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4) 
* [A 2017 Guide to Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/semantic-segmentation-deep-learning-review)  

I was wondering why people are not using approaches which have been more successful than U-Nets for natural images like DeepLab, Mask R-CNN or Tiramisu (the NVIDIA blog post uses it). Is it because of the the time taken for these approaches is too large for satellite images or convergence issues. I would love for someone with insight into this to help me out here.

I would think the plots are designed to illustrate effectiveness of their outlier detection methods, but this fact is not obvious to me.

I'm used to seeing RL networks consisting of a few layers (like 4?) of convolutions followed by a possible recurrent layer, a fully-connected layer, then the output layer.

However, the model in this paper is quite different. The input image, along with the previous action, is processed through a convolutional layer and a series of ResBlocks (8!). After a recurrent layer, each element of an action tuple is decoded one by one in an autoregressive fashion. So if it's outputting brush color, brush size, and brush location, there are 3 ""iterations"" . And when the output corresponds to a location (e.g. brush location) there are (again) 8 ResBlocks.

My best guess for choosing/being able to train such a large network is because the ""environment"" isn't so dynamic and unpredictable like typical game environments prominent in the DRL literature.

Is it normal to see these kinds of architectures in DRL? Am I behind the times? Or am I just reading this paper wrong?",1,4,False,self,,,,,

`weight = weight - step_size * adjusted_weight`

The data set I chose is the [credit card fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). At the end of the project I'll have to write a report explaining my whole project.

The sampling techniques I have investigated are under-sampling, over-sampling, SMOTE, and letting the algorithm do the class balancing itself.

The report has two sections. One explains how I tested the algorithms and the second is how I analyzed and compared the algorithms.

Q1. For under-sampling what I done first is to under-sample the original data, this gives me X_under and y_under. I then split the under-sampled data to get X_train_under, y_train_under, X_test_under and y_test_under. After that I split the original training set to get X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test.

I then train a classifier on the under-sampled data and then on the original data. When training and testing for the under-sampled data I would feed in X_train_under, y_train_under, X_test_under and y_test_under into the learning algorithm. When training and testing on the original data I would feed in X_train_under, y_train_under, X_test, y_test. The predictive accuracy of these two approaches were close to each other (around 93%). Afterwards I just feed in the skewed data which is X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test, the performance of this approach is not as accurate (around 64%).

I'm I doing the sampling technique correctly?

Q2. I'm kind of confused between the testing and the analysis/comparison of the algorithms. What I understand by testing the algorithms is that I would train the classifier and then I would **test** it on unseen data. Is this approach correct and what other approaches could I use?

For the analysis and comparison of the algorithms I would use metrics such as ROC, AUC, and confusion matrices to compare the different algorithms to each other. Is this approach correct and what other approaches could I use? Also how would I come to the conclusion that an algorithm is better than the others. For example is it when the AUC score for logistic regression is better than the AUC score for SVM?

Thanks for giving this a look. I'm hoping for advice on how to build a model for the following problem.

Abstractly, I have a dataset consisting of many independent time series. I would like to create a model that, given an input time series of the same form, outputs clusters within that time series.

Explanatory example: suppose I have a table with fields: [timestamp, bakery_id, order_description, order_amount]. I'd like a model that, given a bakery's log, identifies the groups of orders most likely to be from their most valuable/most retained customers (e.g. the croissants from date A, date B, date C, and date D with amounts $W, $X, $Y, and $Z were likely from customer M, and the buns from date ... with amounts ... were likely from customer N).

Of note:

* The dates within a group of orders tend to be approximately cyclical (e.g. every day, every week, every two weeks, every month, etc.), but different groups may have different cycles (e.g. customer M comes in every other week but customer N comes in monthly)

* The order amounts tend to be the same within a group, perhaps with outliers

* The order descriptions are not sparse (they include the pastry type and noisy notes), and tend to be very similar within a group

The challenges seem to lie mainly in that:

* The number of clusters varies (and is possibly 0) between time series

* Each time series has many noisy rows that ideally would not belong to any cluster

I've looked into clustering with Euclidean distance, both hierarchically and through DBSCAN. Namely, I've mapped the dates to polar coordinates for day-of-week and for day-of-month. However, the results are highly sensitive to scaling factors used for the dimensions (e.g. date-related feature values have a very different distribution than order amount values), so I don't think that will work.

Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",0,2,False,self,,,,,

In other words, the centre and the width/height of the bounding boxes are divided by the image width and height. 
I am confused regarding the output of the network. According to the paper, the network predicts offsets relative to the grid cell.  

these offsets are added to cx, and cy.

The cx and cy values are the indices of the cell which contains the object. They are integers lying in the range [0,12].

Also, the pw and ph values are the anchor width and height corresponding to the box with the highest confidence. They are floating point numbers lying in (0, 13).

The output computed using the equations is w.r.t the gridd cell: 
bx = (tx) + cx

by = (ty) + cy

bw = pw * e^tw

bh = ph * e^th

i.e the centre values(bx,by) will be between [0,13]. In order to draw the bounding boxes we need the centre w.r.t the original image(416*416). 

I have the following questions: 
1. So why do we actually compute these equations?  
2. The mean square Loss of the network is computed between the ground truth bounding boxes normalized wr.t. image dimensions and between (bx,by) or (tx,ty) ?

I am very new to the Machine Learning community, having learned many of the concepts in only the past 3 to 4 months. Recently, the Tensorflow.js API was released. I've seen a lot of people saying that Machine Learning in JavaScript is a waste of time and simply not right.

I would like to challenge this a little. I believe client-side machine learning could open a new world of potential applications of this technology.

First, privacy can be left entirely to the client. Recommendation engines built and stored locally would require little to data being sent to the server. The client would also not rely on the server to pick and choose what options it wants to show to the client, in the case of a busy connection.

Extending onto this, many users are heavily concerned about mobile data usage. If the client does not need to upload and download extra data to the server for the recommendation engine (or other service) to work, this could optimise data usage.

Furthermore, as the video from the summit stated, using javascript allows machine learning applications to be nearly universal. Every commonly used device uses some sort of browser, which typically allow the use of JavaScript. When developing in JavaScript you can spend less time worrying about making things cross-platform, and more time on the important things.

What do you think?

Why the emphasis on transformations that have unit determinant? 

Is it because this allows the probability at the output to be explicitly calculated, AND an explicit form of the probability is needed in order to participate in a KL regularizer?

If that is not it, I do not understand.  An generic feedforward net can transform a given distribution to any other distribution I believe (probably with some exceptions where the jacobian would need to be infinity or something). So what is the big deal?

2. Why is it even needed?

The normalizing flows and related works are motivated starting from VAEs.  
In a VAE you have a deep net (arbitrary powerful) mapping from the input to the latent, and another arbitrary powerful DNN mapping from the latent to the output.  So the latent can stay simple, and still express any desired output.

In fact in the paper Kim &amp; Mnih Disentangling by Factorising, they argue that having a simple factorized latent is the goal:
     ""we wish for a factorial distribution q(z) = prod_j q(z_j)''

I read someone say that the posterior for a given data point could be multimodal, and that is why more flexible posterior is needed.  Not understanding this!  
Say the data ""point"" is an image. A particular image is a fixed thing, not a random process. So _ideally_ there should be some particular latent $z$ that generates it, not a multimodal distribution.  The distributions introduced in VAE seem like a regularization introduced by that method, rather than something that is fundamentally true.


I can see that I am deeply misunderstanding something. Thank you for your help people.

Stopped on a notation question.

It describes VAE, then argues that VAE is insufficient for representation learning. 
On page 3, ""...when p_theta(x|z) = q(x) is close to achievable, the task of density estimation becomes disconnected from the goal of representation learning.
Later a theorem (p. 5), that ""...p(x|z)=q(x) is the only global optimum of the VAE objective"".

But what is q(x) in these statements?  

I am too familiar with the VAE notation that q(z|x) is the ""encoder"", but there is no q(x).
I could think the paper is using q() for both the encoder and decoder, but in fact it uses p_theta(x|z) for the encoder.

In many cases, there are publicly available datasets with published results from other researchers. However, it's very easy to overfit to one of these publicly available datasets. How is this generally handled in the research community, especially when reviewing papers? Do they tend to look more closely at your methods. With regards to understanding your results in context, do they tend to ignore extremely high results, or do they look more generally at a range rather than specific numbers ? Because it's so easy to overfit, it's seem a matter of trust between the researcher and others that the researcher didn't overfit to a test set (even to a small degree) and just provided a convincing case for their methodology.
 
Also, in many cases, a strong test result can be merely a matter of luck or random test set distribution. Honestly, in some cases a model that scored minutely less than a top scoring model may be just as good if not better than the top scoring model. I know sometimes bootstrapping is used to produce confidence intervals - is there an expectation that bootstrapping or something similar would be used alongside producing any test set results?",3,4,False,self,,,,,

Of course the possibility of outsourcing some of the more tedious work has come up, none of us here are familiar with the ML outsourcing scene and all have different opinions on the subject.

I personally think there are a lot of people chancing their arm and just forking YOLO + some pretrained weights and doing transfer learning approaches with little understanding + ability of designing architectures. The space seems very bubblely at the moment with everyone hopping onto the deep learning bandwagon.

Does anyone here have experience with outsourcing? If so what are the pitfalls? Is it as much of a wild west scenario as I think?

Their implementations were run competitively against one another at test time. One student used some sort of optimisation algorithm that discovered an awesome 'hack' - by placing a move very from the origin, often the opponent's code would run out of memory trying to process the move. As such, this would beat many opponents.

Last year my friend Daniel and I launched http://aigrant.org to give away money to people doing interesting open source AI projects. We gave out $100,000 in grants to 30 different projects. You can see some of the winners here: http://aigrant.org/#finalists

We're launching another round of AI Grant. This time, we're giving away up to 30 grants. We reduced the cash amount to $2500, but Google has stepped in to sponsor $20,000 per grantee in GCE credits, which is phenomenal.

The program is open to anyone; no credentials required. We tried to keep the application process as simple as possible so that you can apply in 30 minutes instead of spending days writing a grant proposal. You can apply at https://aigrant.org/apply.html

Applications are due April 14th. We'd be happy to answer questions and would welcome any feedback or ideas.

Thanks!",16,97,False,self,,,,,

I have found that using ReLU activations, my gradients start to explode quickly and everything NaNs out.

I've tried searching around and I don't see too many people talking about ReLUs causing gradients to explode, but I don't think there's anything wrong with my implementation so I'm wondering if there are any strategies I can look into to see how to control these gradient values, as I'd prefer to use ReLU over sigmoid in general.

TLDR: I was trying to use ReLU activations with softmax + cross entropy at the output, found that gradients were exploding. Switched to sigmoids and everything calmed down and worked better, but want to figure out how I can tame the gradients using ReLUs.",17,13,False,self,,,,,

The problem is, now that I'm finally getting deep into studying ML/DL materials I'm finding that my math skills are really not good enough.

To give a specific example, I just started reading [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020). Prior to picking this up, I also looked at the wildly praised Bishop's Pattern Recognition and the Elements of Statistical Learning, but it felt that the book I picked best matched the things I don't know about / want to learn.

But just as I'm working through the probability refresher chapter, I'm starting to feel my usual ""I should know more about this"" feeling. To be extra specific, just the mention of student's/laplace/gamma/beta distributions are something I never experienced in my previous studies. Or things like multi-variate distributions. Or even something like hypothesis testing is something that was almost untouched during my undergrad.

To give another example, I've been trying to catch up on the recent DL papers and most of the time I don't have trouble with the math, but last week I was reading the Wasserstein GAN paper and just a mention of Lipschitz continuity makes me feel like a first year undergrad.

There are many more things I could list, but you probably get the general idea.

To put this in more perspective, my undergrad was quite math-ish, yet there are things that clearly weren't covered, or they were and I have no intuition of them. There also aren't really any more courses I can take that teach more of the advanced stuff without actually taking classes with the math majors at a different faculty.

The reason I'm saying all of this, is that I can't really imagine myself finishing my thesis next year and going into a PhD where it might be expected of me to write a paper like the WGAN one.

I'm not sure how this compares to US, though I asked my professor at a deep learning seminar and he basically said that he knows of one university in Switzerland that teaches DL with lots of applied theory, and that otherwise there isn't really any course I can take to learn the more advanced stuff in probability / linear algebra / calculus.

For example, in my two probability courses we covered stuff like basic probability theory, and then moved on to markov chains, bits of queue theory, bits of poisson processes. But looking at the ML: A Prob Perspective book, it feels as if I had only taken the most basic probability theory. In Linear algebra, we did all the basic stuff, all the fun decompositions (SVD, QR, LU), eigenvalues, orthogonal matrices, etc., but we didn't touch any vector calculus, and I don't really have any intuition for any of the more advanced stuff, other than understanding the definitions/proofs. As for calculus, we kinda ended with Lagrange multipliers and did a bit about theory of metric spaces, but again, reading most of the papers, I feel like knowing what a Jacobian is is the only useful thing I know.

One paper I came across attempts to group gradients into ""indicative features"" that exhibit a certain distribution in a non-attack setting, and compare incoming gradients against this distribution and reject them if they appear to be significant outliers.

This approach seems like it would be difficult to make work in a scenario where a given ""learner"" (assuming some kind of distributed or peer-to-peer network where nodes learn collaboratively) only has access to a subset of a global dataset, and thus can't know what the expected distribution is for a gradient that was produced by training on data it has never seen. 

I suppose this problem could maybe be attended to by polling peers to see if anyone else has knowledge about this kind of data?

Another approach I considered was simply rejecting proposed weight updates if the update would cause loss to go up. But again this seems like it would only really work if each node/learner has access to the same validation set that is representative of the global dataset. Would also be problematic in the sense that sometimes a slight loss increase is just a natural part of stochastic gradient descent.

In distributed ML settings, what are common approaches to defending against malicious nodes seeking to subvert the overall learning process via poisoning?",3,6,False,self,,,,,

Let me preface this by letting you know that I'm an industrial design student with only a shallow understanding ofcomputer vision, ML and neural networks.  I'vebeengiventhebriefofdesigning asetofchesspiecesto bemadebyaluminumextrusion(thesamemethodused inmakingpasta).

OneoftheconceptsI amresearching, is to designchesspiecesthatwouldfool a computer vision program in a traditional CV chess seutp. The line of though is, that since computers are able to beat humans in chess, and now even inthegame go, we could ""fight back"" by utilizing ourhigh fidelitysenses.I understand that this ""man vs machine"" trope is kind of silly, but I think it would help the layman awareness of compter vision. Theproject would be adiscursivedesign project, whose aim would be to spread knowledge about thehowsand whys of computer vision. Computers ""see"" the world very differently from us, and what might seem obvious for us, can be overwhelmingly confusing for a computer. I think this is aninterestingnotion, that not many casual observers of computer vision and AI technology are aware of.

I have spent a little time reading about computer vision and it application in identifying chess pieces. As far as I understand, this involves some sort of edge detection to separate thepiecesfrom the board, and to identify the individual pieces. I also find the concepts of adversarial images very interesting, as discussed inthesearticles:https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15271874/ai-adversarial-images-fooling-attacks-artificial-intelligencehttps://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597276/google-ai-image-attacks-adversarial-turtle-rifle-3d-printed

Designing a unique looking set of chess pieces would of course fool a program trained on images of conventional chess sets, but I figure that it would be no hassle for it to retrain as long as it could distinguish the new pieces. I'm hoping to design pieces that a neural network would struggle to learn.The first article is how I came across your work.

Discrimination, excessive data collection and misuse, project Maven (the Google AI project with the Pentagon), monopolistic behaviors, ads ads ads...
The list goes on and on. 

The $ that comes (directly and indirectly) from these questionable activities funds projects that we all use on a daily basis: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Pyro, AWS, ...

The $ that comes (directly and indirectly) from these questionable activities also funds some of the most remarkable research in the field.

Contrast this with ethically cleaner, more academic projects like sk-learn (and to a lesser extent mxnet), and to ethically cleaner research conducted in academic settings. 

Sometimes it's impossible to compete with massive amounts of money thrown at a problem - often resulting in the death of independent projects and independent research. 

Should we, as a group, be more mindful of this distinction and go out of our way, when possible, to support research and frameworks whose funding sources aren't ""compromised""?

My current implementation is a VGG net with few fully connected layers at the end which are supposed to produce the x/y coordinates scaled to the respective interval of the last Activation layer (eg 0-1 for sigmoid or -1 to 1 tanh).

I am currently facing the problem, that the network works quite good but the closer the landmarks are too the border the higher the error margins are. I tried a clamped relu(0,1) but it improved the accuracy by maybe 2% to 86%. The dataset I am using is(currently) fully generated and spreads the landmarks uniform (still in pattern) across the input.

Now my question:

Should I just move the landmarks more inwards (maybe pad the input)  or are there other things I might have missed?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

 In my ideal world someone would provide me with:
 1. a general guide on how to do read a machine learning paper

2.  a set of papers that are basic and representative of the literature, and ideally develop fundamental understanding of useful machine learning topics.

3. a guide sort of ""answer key"" to these papers that breaks down the key concepts that one should have understood as well as things that might have slipped under the radar of someone less experienced.

4. Some sort of ""book club"" (of research papers of course) for those trying to learn either based on the aforementioned set of papers or moving beyond it.

This is a lot to ask for, at this point I don't have much I can offer in return. If anyone else is interested in the book club idea I'm willing to organize it although if it wasn't obvious I lack the experience to properly curate the resources.

How the game works:

&gt; You can select any tile you own every second, and this will increment it. Once it hits 5, it will take ownership of the 4 adjacent tiles, increment them, and remove ownership of the current tile. You can take over other land with this. Score is determined by the count of each tile added together.

The way I approached this was to rewrite the game, set up neural networks in a genetic setting, inputs are a 7x7 grid around each tile (3 times: 0/1 for on the grid or not, count/4 for own tile, and count/4 for enemy tile, effectively creating 7*7*3 inputs). For a given tile owner, I parse each 7x7 grid, get a ""score"", and the tile with the highest score is selected to upgrade/expand.

******

So, unfortunately, the way I handled this was by dumping 20 of them (in grid formation, but randomly sorted) into a 41x41 grid and waited 500 ticks and did my genetic reproduction magic. This meant, however, that what took over is an ""always go left"", because whoever spawns on the left-most side will eat up everybody, and everybody else will ""surrender"" (I presume if I left it running long enough, it will also develop a ""go down afterwards""), **maximizing the fittest, but not the average**.

So, what could a solution be? I could put each agent against bots so they have no impact on each other, but then they just learn to exploit the pre-written bots and not necessarily improve beyond the bots. I could also have them run live, on the site, however that would take much, much longer.

I feel like this would apply to tons of other situations as well, like chess. If a bot does well enough on white to take over a population, it could have a mutation that makes it always forfeit as black. This would cause that agent to win even more, and then reproduce even more.

P.S. I don't know if this is unrelated, but if they're all playing each other, how could you see improvements anyway? The fitness score might even go down as they improve and get on equal footing. I've tried to look at stats like ""tiles claimed"" or ""tiles stolen"" as an indication of whether or not they're getting better, but I'm having no luck.

EDIT: Another solution could be to split up my population of 20 into four populations of 5, so something that takes over in one could only ""control"" a quarter of the total population.",30,23,False,self,,,,,

""If p(x|z) is given arbitrary flexibility, it can in fact learn to ignore z completely and always output the data distribution for each z:  p(x|z) = p(z). ...
If you make the generator of a VAE too complex, give it lots of modeling power on top of z, it will ignore your latent variables as they are not needed to achieving a good likelihood.""

It is from the blog post in Huszar, Is Maximum Likelihood Useful for Representation Learning, however other papers have said the same.

The question: how is this possible? The VAE needs to maximize the data likelihood term

  E__q(z|x)[ log p(x|z) ]

for each data point. So it needs to generate an x on the output that resembles the x on the input. If the generator ignores z, _it will always output the same pattern_ I believe, and so cannot try to match the particular inputs.

Does it have something to do with considering the cost across all the data in a minibatch simultaneously? I do not see it yet.

-Would have to build models in Python (which I prefer) 

-Would be comparetivly easy and give me free time to pursue online courses in machine learning and math. (This is the biggest advantage for me, as I am weak at math and would have to use it a lot in my thesis).

-There would be no mentor, would have to do it all by myself (only the professor to guide me). (This is the biggest drawback, as they don't have an experienced ML engineer and no existing model I can work with).

Company 2
-Works with computer vision (which I don't know).

-Would have to implement algorithms in c++ (which I hear is hard as several algorithms have to be implemented from scratch).

-Would be hard cause I have no knowledge of computer vision, or good knowledge of machine learning and it won't give me time to pursue online courses to solidify my skills.(biggest drawback, as my math is weak and wouldn't give me time to brush up on it.)

-There would be an experienced ML engineer and a computer vision expert to guide me, and they have an existing product that I would be working on (biggest advantage, would give me a chance to learn a lot.)


My end goal is not to work in the field of computer vision. Just learn machine learning and be good at it. Which one should I go for?

This means that if you give the NN the inputs of a photo it recognizes whats in the photo, and if you give him a game of chess it plays the game.

I know you could handle everything with some code, and then run the specific purpose NN, but that would mean developer interaction,  which is not very nice.

I was thinking about using neutral neurons and detached thoughts.

Neutral neurons are neurons that do not affect the result in any way (they are effectively just a placeholder for something new to learn).

Detached thinking means triggering a specific set of neurons (the ones necessary for a specific task) while turning off others, to make sure that the result is correct (not affected by anything external) and also quick.

Is this possible in any way? Are my ideas crazy or they may have some value?

DL@Jeju is a one-month program to learn deep learning techniques and implement your ideas together with your mentors at a beautiful place, Jeju Island, Korea. DL@Jeju is sponsored by Google, Kakao, Netmarble and SK telecom.

Please first have a look how fun it was in the last year event.

[Photos - DL@Jeju in 2017] https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNjsUS8-WQBNYJRQ6k2taJCS1BT68XbQQDAqtgImNqUUpEKyzhvJVyQbdcpdoubqA?key=NDVHVlpaVWduTllrbXh2ZEN5Qkp4aUp4TkhkQVZB

DL@Jeju is not a summer school where the participants just take lectures, but a hackathon-like camp where the participants set their own goals and achieve them with a collaboration with other participants and mentors. After the camp, you will have an arXiv publication and codes on GitHub as the achievement of the research from the camp.

We are hosting from 20 to 30 participants in this year as (in the last year). All participants will be provided accommodations, 1000USD stipends and a part of the flight support (up to 300USD). We believe that you will have unforgettable summer days in Jeju with great friends and great achievements. The friendly city Jeju does not require Visa for most international visitors to stay up to 30 days. Thus, don't worry about it, but just apply it for your summer and your future.

I have a model that's trained to detect various concepts on biomedical papers. It's a pretty standard convolutional neural network. I'm using the last dense layer before the output to use as vector embeddings for these medical papers. I then use k-means on the embedding vectors to cluster the papers together. I prefer this over a pure unsupervised approach as these embeddings will be forced to focus on biological similarity over biological &amp; semantic.

I have about 10M papers and each cluster needs to have ~50 elements. Should I use spherical or euclidean distance for k-means? On a secondary note, anyone have good recommendations of ways to evaluate the accuracy of the clustering aspect? The size of the dense layer is 512.

I've collected data, for a control setup and a test setup. 
The tasks are designed to be visually similar but force different eye-movement patterns by varying the various other non-visual factors.
I have around 5 minutes of data for each class, from the same participant.
I'm trying to produce a binary classifier which can predict which class a data sequence belongs to (thereby estimating the non-visual factors which were varied in the experiment). I've begun by using simple velocity threshold algorithms to identify saccades and fixations in the eye data, but am lost on how to take this further into a classification algorithm/setup. I would assume some kind of windowing system if I'm pre-processing the input data to identify saccades/fixations. 
I'm somewhat familiar with ML theory - would appreciate help with this real-world data problem. Anyone with experience on eye-tracking data? Or time-series positional data? Thank you!",8,3,False,self,,,,,

Let's say you create a simple Parts of speech tagger.

It has randomly initialized word vectors with 100 dimensions. It has an LSTM layer that has 500 dimensions, and is randomly initialized. It has a softmax cross-entropy output layer.

The LSTM layers presumably have a number of pairwise ""and"" functions, such that it might find some association when dimension 5 and dimension 7 are both high simultaneously.

So let's say you train this model and you measure the performance of your model.

Now, let's take the input word vectors from our trained model, and export them. Lets randomly initialize a new network, but instead this time, we will import the vectors from the previously trained model of the word embedding layer, and not only that, we will make them immutable so that the backpropagation error is not allowed to alter these values.

Now, from a mathematical perspective, I would like to understand:

Should gradient descent find a similar solution, and result in a similarly performing model as to the first model we ran?

If not, is there some sort of symbiotic relationship between the original random LSTM network values and the original word vectors that are lost, if you throw just one of them away, and that gradient descent will not likely be able to uncover those non-linear associations in the LSTM that are encoded in the embeddings that were initially created?  (and thus result in poorer performance for model #2)",2,0,False,self,,,,,

There has already been significant amount of research in this field, but mostly are done for residential houses and not for commercial/office spaces.

As a result I feel there is gap, where in much research is not done for floor plan detection for office spaces specifically when there is complex structures, specifically narrowing down to curved walls and open spaces. 

My idea is to load image get its vector representation and pass this vector representation to a modelling algorithm to get a digitised model of the paper based floor plan. With this end customer need not have any knowledge of designing softare.

771,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2018-4-13,2018,4,13,14,8bwriy,self.MachineLearning,[D] Ways to approach Facebook's hope to identify hate speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8bwriy/d_ways_to_approach_facebooks_hope_to_identify/,SpiritedAssociation,1523596508,"There has been some recent discussion in mainstream media about the automated detection of hate speech by Facebook. This interests me, as I had drafted a research proposal last year on this exact topic (the proposal was declined. We went with something else). It's a really cool idea, and I am hopeful that such a tool might have a positive impact on the world, but it is important when considering such a thing the technological and social contexts in which it exists and what that might contribute to the thing itself.

To my knowledge, there is some amount of concern about such a thing. For example, I have heard Glenn Beck express some amount of wariness about there being efforts to even begin to define hate speech as would be necessary to identify hate speech automatically. There is not a small amount of relevancy to such concerns. Even with a clear definition of what hate speech is, there is difficulty in knowing with reasonable confidence that such a definition is not biased. The labeler forms the world to their mind, this is not new and is a very strong point to Mr. Beck.

Where the really interesting stuff takes place is in how Facebook might reach a definition of hate speech. Going into such a venture knowing full well that we bring our subjective bias to the table with us, how might we address a problem that is as precarious as the task of telling a computer how to tag hate speech? For Facebook that answer is likely to involve some amount of crowd sourcing, as they do have existing features in their software that allow users to suggest that a given post has indecent content. After a post has been reported a sufficient amount of times by a variety of different individuals, you have perhaps some amount of filtering done by a computer and then a person or a group of people making a judgement call on whether the post is removed or not. This is probably roughly what Facebook has right now for dealing with offensive posts, and the fruits of this process are likely to be what Facebook will draw on when attempting to create the numerical definition of hate speech necessary to tell a computer what hate speech is (if they haven't drawn on it already. It seems likely they will have been doing this for years now). The process here is to begin with a set of existing posts that are ""known"" to contain offensive content, and then create statistical classifiers like neural networks that take as input a segment of text and provide as output the statistical probability that the given piece of content is offensive. A high probability would be used as the criteria for automatically removing the content assumed to be offensive. An accurate classifier will reflect the biases in the data set of human tagged posts as its purpose is only to reflect the data which it was trained on. This is the technical context in which this discussion occurs.

With an idea of how facebook is likely to begin this gargantuan task, what improvements might we make? My contention, what I might like to put forth to you the reader, is that the most effective path forward would be to improve the data set that this statistical classifier is built on. It is my contention that this might be done by creating a purpose-specific project that fully commits to crowd sourcing the tagging of content as being offensive or containing hate speech, one that does not use any filtering that relies on an axiomatic definition of hate speech or relies on a small set of moderators to filter the tagged content. Let the masses speak their mind as best as we might enable ourselves to. If one draws a sufficiently diverse set of individuals from the general population of the locale in which such an undertaking is happening AND steps are taken to ensure that the tagging process is not exploited by an external agent, the end product of labeled content would be effectively a mirror of the consensus model of truth that drives modern western science. This crowd sourcing has been utilized in the past in the creation of similar datasets such as the ConceptNet of MIT, a database of common knowledge like ""fire is hot"", and perhaps the lessons learned in the creation of resources like ConceptNet might be effectively leveraged here. There aren't a lack of difficulties in actualizing such a crowd sourced tagging of data, but it is something that is incredibly exciting... that perhaps somewhere in a digital world, the complexity and implications of which society is beginning to come to terms with, there exists an ability to formally describe in part the societal contexts from which things like hate speech and opposition to hate speech emerge.

So my question to you, dear reader (if you should happen to still be here. I'm surprised if you are), is this: is a crowd sourced definition of hate speech a valid definition of hate speech, is it merely a chaos of the masses, or perhaps something else entirely?",15,2,False,self,,,,,
772,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2018-4-13,2018,4,13,14,8bwuyg,self.MachineLearning,[D] Anyone having trouble finding papers on a particular topic ? Post it here and we'll help you find papers on that topic ! | Plus answers from 'Helping read ML papers' post from few days ago.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8bwuyg/d_anyone_having_trouble_finding_papers_on_a/,BatmantoshReturns,1523597741,"There's a lot of variation in terms in machine learning which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times. 

If you have a concept you would like to obtain more papers about, post it here (along with all papers you already found on said concept) and we'll help you find them. 

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented  very similar concepts in a previous paper. 

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it. 

&gt;As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too. 

So post a topic/idea/concept, along with all the papers you already found on it, and we'll help you find more. 

Even if you weren't thinking about looking for one in particular, it doesn't hurt to check if you missed anything. Post your concept anyway. 

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept. 

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology. 

-----------------------------------------------

I also want to give an update to the post I made 3 days ago where I said I would help on any papers anyone was stuck on. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8b4vi0/d_anyone_having_trouble_reading_a_particular/

I wasn't able to answer all the questions, but I at least replied to each of them and started a discussion which would hopefully lead to Answers. Some discussions are on going and pretty interesting. 

I actually indexed them by Paper name in this subreddit

https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPapersQandA/

I hope people go through them, because some questions are unanswered so perhaps there were some people who didn't get around to opening the papers, but when they see the discussion of the problem they'll know the answer and can answer it. 

Also, there are a lot of FANTASTIC and insightful answers for the questions that did get answered. Special thanks to everyone who answered.

Apologies if I missed anyone. 

I might do a round 2 of this in a week or two depending on how much free time I have, with a much better format I planned out. 

Anyone who participates in this post will have priority if they have a paper by then.

observed, because baselines original implementation does not normalize either advantage estimate before backprop the action head or normalize returns before backprop value head.

When testing with Acrobot-v1, it leads to loss explosion, (loss value becomes very large like 20000), then the policy cannot learn anything.

After adding normalization to the returns for the value head, the problem solved.

So it seems the point is that when we allow large max time step for an episode, without normalization, the MSE loss with become very big ? 

Just to make sure if I made any mistake, is it correct to normalize (actually standardize to [-1, 1]) for both returns (to value head) and GAEs (to action head. )

I'm planning on renting an AWS EC2 instance for a machine learning research project which needs more than 32 Go of RAM (so 64 Go would be spot on) as well as a GPU equivalent to a Titan Black. I need to train for approximately 12 hours.

The problem is that I have no idea how to compare the power of a Titan Black to AWS EC2's ""g3.4xlarge"", ""g3.8xlarge"" etc ... Is there a FLOPS figure somewhere to compare them one to another ? Or even better, a nice chart with Model name &lt;--&gt; AWS EC2 instances ? I know this isn't so simple as those are virtual environment etc but knowing precisely the power of the instance is crucial to determine the time the training will likely take and thus the cost of renting it.

I have no way of accessing anything remotely as powerful as I need to IRL, so renting computational power is my only option. I already tested it on my machine with smaller dataset and everything runs smoothly so now it's just a matter of scaling it up and seeing if it breaks.

Hello, kind stranger.  Im a student at University of Helsinki in pursuit of my MSc in *Algorithms, Data Analysis and Machine Learning.*  For my thesis Ive created a unique story-based game that utilizes all three facets of my degree in novel ways.  The AI utilizes machine learning and the enemies have individual genetics as part of the gameplay, and to fully accomplish the Data Analysis portion of my degree I need as many people to play the game as I can convince to give it a try.  The game is completely free and designed in such a way that anyone of any skill level can play it, because whether you win or lose a level the story will continue progressing on to the next level.   Skip to the bottom of my post to start downloading it from one of three indie game sites.
  

#Game:  
The game is a futuristic, story-based tower defense game that runs on the Windows and MacOS 64-bit platforms.  The premise is that it is the year 2238, and humans have left the destabilized Earth to terraform the nearest habitable planets.  You are Shepherd Cartalia, of planet B382, and have supervised the growth of your colony since its founding in 2148.  You have successfully increased your colonys population from meager beginnings to over a thousand citizens, but at the start of the game your sustenance and nutrient generator has begun to malfunction.  Rather than spawning livestock that is ready for slaughter, the animals now produced have become violent and are attacking your people.  It is now your responsibility to put up defenses against the attacks, while you evacuate your people from the outposts scattered across the land, and search for a lasting solution to the unexplained crisis.  
  

#Gameplay Overview:  
The game features ten levels, six tower types with three shared upgrades each, fifteen enemy types, a branching dialogue tree of over 2,500 interactions, and four different endings.  The primary gameplay mechanics are tower selection/placement/upgrading, and dialogue choice.  It will take an average of an hour to complete.  Theres only a single, non-managed save slot but the game can be replayed with increasing difficulty as the machine learning model improves.  
  

#Development Overview:  
I developed this game alone, starting in November of 2017.  The character art, attribute icons, and landscape objects were designed by Yuexin Du, a UI &amp; UX designer from Aalto University.  I used the Monogame framework, FlatRedBall game engine, Accord.Net for machine learning and genetic algorithm classes, Keen.IO for data collection, Sprite Pro for creating the animations, Articy Draft for creating the dialogue tree, Visual Studio 2017 IDE, Tiled for map design, GIMP for artwork creation, and Audacity for sound design.  Most of the music was created by Anttis Instrumentals (/u/Mrloop), a few of the tracks were created by my brother Brallit (/u/Brallit), and one was by Zack Darshon (/u/how_small_a_thought).  The basis for the sound effects were sourced from many CC0 sources on FreeSound.org.  The UI assets and tileset for levels were purchased from GameDevMarket.net.  The title screen images were found on Google Image search using labeled for reuse with modification.  The base for the world map was purchased from the Unity marketplace, and lastly, the sun/moon calculations were performed using Vladimir Agafonkins   
  

#Technical:  
The game utilizes a Deep Belief Network, with one hundred and fifty hidden nodes, and two layers (input/output).  It is trained at the completion of each wave with six hundred and fifty-five data points, comprised of enemy attributes (health, speed, resistances, etc), defense attributes (range, damage type, attack speed, etc.), pathing points, and water hazard size/locations.  Training is done with a mixture of unsupervised and supervised learning on the resulting score of a group of enemies, i.e. a wave.  Each wave is scored calculated by determining how close to the goal each enemy could get, with the total score being the average of all enemies individual scores.  The score is weighted such that if even one enemy reaches the goal that wave would outscore a wave in which every enemy got 99.9% of the way to the goal.    

In addition to machine learning, the game also implements genetic algorithms.  Each type of animal starts with a set of randomized genetics, consisting of eight chromosomes, that alter the animals base attributes.  After every wave in the game the machine learning model is used to rank the fitness of the genetics, by hypothetically scoring an animal using those genetics in the immediate circumstances, and then a tournament ranking is applied to select the best specimens for the following generations with the ideal of progressively improving the genetics of an animal as the machine learning gains proficiency in evaluating fitness.    

To prevent these computationally intensive processes from impacting game performance, they are delegated to a low priority worker thread.  A new model training process only starts when the last one has completed, but each time the process is kicked off all the available data is used to train the models so the intermittent training wont impact model performance.  The game utilizes whichever model was most recently trained for all its decisions, and that model is replaced after each learning and evaluation process.  
  
#Data Collected:  
First, I want to stress that none of the data is personally identifiable.  It is all anonymous and collected for the sole purpose of presenting my thesis.  None of it will be used commercially or for any use outside of writing my thesis.  Having said that, the following data is collected: machine learning model performance, genetic fitness improvement, dialogue choices, tower selection, ending type received, originating geolocation of the player, game launch count, and time played.  
  
#Objective:  
I will be writing a 50+ page thesis on the usage of machine learning and genetic algorithms in games, and will be doing some data analysis on the anonymous statistics reported by the game.  Primarily I am looking at the effectiveness of the machine learning models and genetic algorithms.  I want to see at what sample size the machine learning model outperforms random guesses, and identify the point at which model performance stabilizes.  I am also going to perform a data analysis on the met data collected with no leading hypothesis, but simply make observations based on player generated data.  This may be what dialogue choices are favored by different parts of the world, what dialogue choices are most often chosen, and attempt to identify correlations between dialogue selection and tower selection.  
  
#Personal Note:  
I started this project with the idea of applying machine learning and genetic algorithms to a game, and the theme that most strongly resonated with those concepts isnt one Im particularly fond of.  To be blunt, its quite dark and a bit depressing.  I personally prefer to play, and make, games with happy, uplifting themes (shout out to Stardew Valley which is the inspiration for my other game, Lets Go Fish King!) and creating this game was entirely out of character for me.    
  

There are still many features I wanted to add to this game, such as a technology tree and more play-reactive dialogue, but I dont believe Ill be returning to it this project after this thesis unless I get strong support for the concept.  Perhaps its not a very good game, or perhaps my dislike for the theme I settled on has bled through, but regardless of the actual cause, Im just not a fan of how it turned out.  For that reason Id like to apologize to you ahead of time for asking you to play this quite depressing game for the sake of helping me with my thesis.  I can assure you my next game will be quite a bit brighter, cheerful and hopefully a lot more fun than this attempt.  Despite those misgivings, I truly hope youll give it a play through in the interest of helping me with my thesis.

What shall be the best approach?

I know that MFCCs for the person's speech would be the right input data. Now the question is which one would be the better training method.

So far, we've covered two approaches : First one is using GMMs and reducing the dimensions of the MFCC supervector using the i-vector approach. But for that, no decent libraries are available.


Second approach would be to use a CNN based model, using the MFCC coefficients as an input and training them in a CNN and recognizing the speaker using that. Now before we get to experimentation, we just wanted to know if anyone has done it and which approach did you find the best.



The i-vector approach is extremely mathematically complex (Not that I don't understand Gaussian Mixture Models as such, and not even that I don't understand the mathematics behind any of the operations being done. I just don't know how to implement it).

Of course this isn't something strange since usually the funding goes to something that can have short-term returning ex. 2-4 years. That's why i believe that non-profit organization such as OpenAI can lead the way to General AI.

Now, about OpenAI there have been many posts and discussions ,mainly because of the Gym and Universe enviroments and because of Elon Musk's funding but there is an another non-profit AI research center,the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence which was funded Paul Allen(Microsoft's co-founder) and it has received funds in the same order as OpenAI. The interesting part is that they have goals that i find much more ambitious than OpenAI's.
They have many projects,varying in their purpuse, such as Semantic Scholar, a ""intelligent"" search engine for scientific papers or  project Alexandria for common sense and reasoning. 
And some smaller projects such as GeoS for End-to-End Geometry Problem Solver http://geometry.allenai.org/
 and AllenNLP for http://demo.allennlp.org/machine-comprehension.

What i find weird is that i don't recall reading something about their results or just them being mention in discussions about General AI or even in machine learning. So these is my question,have you heard about them,and if so,what do you think about their goals and their research.

Does anyone here have experience with using ML models to predict markets? I've found it very challenging so far, and I need help.

This is how far I've gotten:

Example 1

https://imgur.com/a/qL4Ft

Example 2 - overfitting

https://imgur.com/a/39POJ

   - Plots at the top, in light green background, are predictions using training data.

   - Plots at the bottom, in light blue background, are predictions using testing data.

   - Blue lines are historical prices of a stock/cryptocurrency.

   - Red lines are predicted future ~5 minute prices, made at time at which the blue line ends.

   - Green and yellow lines are actual future values.

---

I'm using an RNN model to make these predictions. Predictions are percent changes. I'm really clueless as to how to transform my inputs, which are just past prices of different stocks or cryptocurrencies. Right now, I'm just normalizing them (z-score) without any feature extraction.

Obviously, the predictions are far from accurate. As I expected, this project isn't anything like Kaggle competitions or problems for which I've used NNs in the past. Given that I don't know much about finance/quant trading, my progress is excruciatingly slow.

I would like to ask if anyone here would be interested in helping me with this project or being a mentor to guide me on what things to try and avoid. Thanks!",3,0,False,self,,,,,

The reason of this post is because I usually struggle when designing slides for different courses related to Machine Learning. While everyone has their own opinions on whether slides should contain tons of equations/text vs a more visual approach, I think it would be a good exercise to check which resources have you found to be engaging, easy to read, or anything that made you say ""hey, this slides on SVM are awesome!"".

For example, I tend to favor a lot slides that have a simple visual exercise of the concept, such as Aurlien Gron's Capsule Networks video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPN8d0E3900

If you're also a teaching assistant or a professor, and want to share your insights when designing slides, that would be awesome too.

I was curious about how people make use of Tensorflow and I would be glad if people reply to this thread with their own experiences.

For some context I use TF for quite some times now (2 years) and I have my own pipeline that evolved with the different releases  of TF. As of now I divided my process into three stages:

* 1. preprocess data into tfrecords file (specific to each projects) 
* 2. I have a custom parser that read JSON files and create network architecture, the loss to minimize and the training operation related (common to all project, only the JSON changes)
* 3. Implement three function that train, evaluate and export the model. For each project I can use the same backbone and change only few part.

In this regard I was wondering how people use Tensorflow (what does your pipeline looks like, how do you deploy your models, etc.). 

I run my training locally but will surely move on to google cloud platform. That's why I was wondering whether people use tf.Estimator. For now I can't see what it would bring to my pipeline, but maybe I am not informed enough.

Also for dataset, I found this to be very rigid, especially when you need to mix datasets. For instance I had a dataset with 20 classes and have proper balanced batches was a nightmare with tf.Dataset API only so I had to mix everything beforehand. How do you go to shuffle properly your data?

Thanks for reading and hopefully for replying.",22,19,False,self,,,,,

Im building a personal deep learning computer and I was wondering if anyone had advice on the choice of CPU. This is my first computer build ever, so I apologize in advance for being naive. 

I originally purchased an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU along with ASRock AB350 Pro4 mobo, but being so new I didnt realize that with this configuration I couldnt display anything to the screen without an independent GPU. I have plans to get a Nvidia Titan Xp for my DL computation, but am worried about utilizing it for both displaying and computations.

With this in mind I started to research the AMD Ryzen 5 2400G APU (CPU with integrated GPU) however my understanding is the 2400G comes at a performance ding compared to the 1600 (namely, only 4 cores compared to 6 cores). I am wondering if the difference between these two processors will be significant in my DL build? Whats the best option? 

The way I see it there are three options:
1) go with 2400g for dedicated display graphics, leaving my Titan for pure computation and freeing up a PCIe slot for another graphics card down the line
2) go with 1600, plug my monitor into the Titan and share the display/compute load, hoping this allows me to utilize the PC for simple tasks like web browsing while my models are training
3) go with 1600 and get a baseline GPU (i.e. GTX 1030) for dedicated graphics. This gets me full 6-core CPU power with dedicated compute GPU, but the 1030 may go to waste if I decide to add another Titan/1080 Ti to my build down the line.

Price-wise the 1600 and 2400G are basically equivalent, I just cant find any resources comparing them for computational purposes, as most of the benchmarking involves gaming. 

Tl;dr - How much CPU power is needed for most deep learning machines (think image classification, Kaggle competitions, etc.)? How do the AMD Ryzen 5 1600 compare against the 2400G in this context?",8,2,False,self,,,,,

I saw a post of some time ago where somebody wanted to make use of variable length input vectors where the input would represent the pixels of multiple pictures and the resolution of the pictures would change thus the input. 

It seems a bit impossible as removing, changing or adding input nodes makes an impact on the network it self as weights and biases would have to be readjusted. I am doing research about this topic so if you have any insights or interesting papers to read it would be appreciated. 

What do you think ? Would the impact of removing or adding one input node on a relatively small network make a huge impact ? If you keep memory of previous input nodes and place them back into the network after a few time steps would it worsen or better the network ? ",2,6,False,self,,,,,

I have downloaded the files (memory and time are not an issue) but soon realized that there's a lot more to do before being able to actually use them.

First, the bounding boxes available in the version I have include only a subset of all the pictures. For each class there are 1300 pictures for training, but (at least for some of the classes that I've checked) the number of bounding boxes per class is between 400 and 1000. Not to mention that some of the pictures are already smaller than 224x224 so I'm still not sure how those can be cropped.

I know that there's a tensorflow script to handle all the pictures but it converts them to TFrecords and I'd like to save the cropped pictures and view them.

I only need a subset of imagenet (let's say around 20 classes, each with around 1000 pictures for training and 1000 for testing)

It feels like someone must have done that before me and I was wondering if anyone came across a dataset saved somewhere that is already cropped and includes the final images.

I also noticed that I can download the URLs instead of the images themselves. Does anyone know where can I download the 224x224 bounding boxes for the URL images?

Any suggestions to make this process easier? Are there any other large datasets that I can use instead?",0,0,False,self,,,,,

It's never followed with why that is. My gut feeling is that this statement is BS, but I have little to back it up.

I have a CS/Engineering background. I've worked *with* machine learning, but not *on* machine learning (I've taken outputs of algorithms to do things with). So I don't really know what is going on inside the ""black box"", but I know a thing or two about systems. 

The best way I can generalize Machine Learning/AI is:

**""We build a statistical model from a massive sample of data, to figure out what's the best decision given a set of conditions""**

So I understand that we build algorithms that we are not capable of understanding in a modular way (like one would an electric circuit, for example). That doesn't mean we don't understand it, because we very thoroughly understand the process of building this.  One way to think about it is like fluid mechanics. For example:  We can't model the process in a recursively modular way (down to interaction of each molecule), but we understand it by describing it at a larger scale.

So: we do not understand self-learning algorithms on a modular level because they are inherently not fully comprehendable in this way. But we have a pretty good idea how things are working on a macro level.

The statement that ""we don't really understand it"" always seems imply the threat of losing control. Again, I don't really buy that.  You may not fully understand fluid mechanics of bitumen, but there is no question that you can contain it in a pipe (that's a less elegant metaphor but I hope you get what I'm trying to say)


So here's where I'd like some input:

* How would you critique my generalizations above?
* What is the significant difference between machine learning and statistical analysis? What stops us from using the same tools to think about them (from a far enough vantage point)
* Are there concrete examples of mechanisms that we don't understand in ML research?

&gt; *Alexa*  Customer embrace of Alexa continues, with Alexa-enabled devices among the best-selling items across all of Amazon. Were seeing extremely strong adoption by other companies and developers that want to create their own experiences with Alexa. There are now more than 30,000 skills for Alexa from outside developers, and customers can control more than 4,000 smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands with Alexa. The foundations of Alexa continue to get smarter every day too. Weve developed and implemented an on-device fingerprinting technique, which keeps your device from waking up when it hears an Alexa commercial on TV. (This technology ensured that our Alexa Super Bowl commercial didnt wake up millions of devices.) Far-field speech recognition (already very good) has improved by 15% over the last year; and in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, weve improved Alexas spoken language understanding by more than 25% over the last 12 months through enhancements in Alexas machine learning components and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques. (These semi-supervised learning techniques reduced the amount of labeled data needed to achieve the same accuracy improvement by 40 times!) Finally, weve dramatically reduced the amount of time required to teach Alexa new languages by using machine translation and transfer learning techniques, which allows us to serve customers in more countries (like India and Japan).
&gt;
&gt; *Amazon devices*  2017 was our best year yet for hardware sales. Customers bought tens of millions of Echo devices, and Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick with Alexa were the best-selling products across all of Amazon  across all categories and all manufacturers. Customers bought twice as many Fire TV Sticks and Kids Edition Fire Tablets this holiday season versus last year. 2017 marked the release of our all-new Echo with an improved design, better sound, and a lower price; Echo Plus with a built-in smart home hub; and Echo Spot, which is compact and beautiful with a circular screen. We released our next generation Fire TV, featuring 4K Ultra HD and HDR; and the Fire HD 10 Tablet, with 1080p Full HD display. And we celebrated the 10th anniversary of Kindle by releasing the all-new Kindle Oasis, our most advanced reader ever.

Neural networks are not yet [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) because they are good for learning a specific task rather than multiple diverse tasks.

But is that a flaw in the neural network model or simply the fact that we are not training neural networks to diversify their skills? Maybe if we taught the same neural network to recognise cars in images for some time, then train it to recognise aeroplanes for instance, then maybe switch back to the first task, then the second, so on and so forth ... maybe the neural network will eventually become good at the both the tasks.

Initially when the neural network switches from one task to the other it will take a significant amount of time to unlearn its knowledge on cars while simultaneously learning what aeroplanes are. We provide the neural network enough time to do so. But as we keep switching the tasks, the neural network might learn to remember both the car and the aeroplane at the same time.

If we take this idea to another level, we could potentially teach the same neural network hundreds of tasks given enough training time and sample data. Pretty much the difference between teaching a young kid just chess for the rest of his life, and teaching language, arithmetic, science and social skills altogether at the same pace.

I have a quick puzzle. I will not name the papers for sake of simplicity.
Lets consider 3 papers:
A appeared on arxiv on 1st week of March submitted to conference x.
B (ours) appeared on arxiv a week later but was submitted to conference y with deadline the same week as x but different domain. 
C appeared on arxiv last week and cites A. 

All papers deal with the same problem. All treat the problem very similarly. Papers A and C deal with a different application compared to B.

We are the authors of B.

Q1. Do you approach the authors of papers A and C to alert them of our existence? Such that at least we all cite each other on the footnotes saying concurrent work. (we plan to do that anyway when we update the paper after revision)

Q2. I am inclined to say yes. Am I thinking wrong and risking something? 

Q3. At some point they may all be trying to take these to a journal. I would welcome that we all co author this! But is it likely to happen?

My name is James and I'm a Co-Founder at Empirical Automation. Our mission is to make robotics more accessible, especially for researchers in ML and AI, to help advance the field faster. I'm super excited to present to you our Caesar Robot Platform, an affordable industrial robot for only $3K USD:

http://www.empiricalautomation.com/caesar.html  

Inspired by recent exciting work over the last few years in robotics and deep learning, me and a few college buddies wanted to try some experiments of our own. So naturally we went online and tried to buy a PR2 robot - and then realized we had a better chance of putting a downpayment on a house. And so it started! We set out to address to this big gap between research-capable robots that can accomplish tasks in the real world, and the small and impractical toy robots out there. 

After many iterations and pilot trials, we are launching Caesar: a robot with ""human worker-like specs"" that's designed for ML and AI research. Aside from being a reliable and practical arm, Caesar comes with dual stereo cameras on its neck, and a wrist-mounted camera as well, so it can see what it's doing, and collect data, from multiple perspectives. 

http://www.empiricalautomation.com/research.html 

By making robots affordable and easy to use (just plug in to a power bar, and USB to your laptop for direct programming in e.g. Python), we want to enable people to do cool experiments like Google's multi-robot learning. Except you won't need to acquire a company or spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it. And by making it easier for schools, labs, and hobbyists to all afford the same platform, there can be much more data sharing and replication of experiments. This we see as critical to helping move the field forward from a research perspective. 

We're also developing a lightweight simulator, with the same goals in mind: something immediately useful for ML and AI, and super acessible. In fact, you can download a trial demo from our website right now: 

http://www.empiricalautomation.com/basis.html 

It's got a physics engine, model of Caesar, the ability to record and export data (robot commands + all vision data), and save/load/replay previously developed motion paths. Of course real Caesar has all these functions as well :) 

Anyways, we're very excited to show this community our robot and get your feedback! Caesar is available for orders right now, with a 4-6 week lead time as we continue to optimize our supply chain and production process. I'll be around to answer questions and take notes from the community. 

Cheers! ",19,22,False,self,,,,,

To start with, which of the following correctly describes the output format:

* A single vector of length `V`
* A separate vector of length `V` for each nearby word in the context

Where `V` is the vocabulary size.

[This diagram](http://wuciawe.github.io/files/2017-02-12-notes-on-word2vec/sg.png) illustrates the problem. It seems to show multiple output vectors (`y1`, `y2`, etc.), all of which share the same weight matrix (`W'`). Is this correct?

Other diagrams ([1](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/word2vec-skip-gram.png), [2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FTfdlZ7yDBoQ8c9W.png)) show a single output vector, which seems simpler, but raises questions.

I think the correct answer is that model produces a single output vector representing nearby words. This would make sense if we trained the model to do basic classification, where each input corresponds to a single correct output (like MNIST image recognition). However, the skip-gram model actually seems to perform multi-label classifcation, where a given input can correspond to multiple correct outputs. For example, if we have ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" in our corpus, then the following are all valid training samples:

* Input: *brown*, Target: *the*
* Input: *brown*, Target: *quick*
* Input: *brown*, Target: *fox*
* Input: *brown*, Target: *jumps*

Clearly, *brown* maps to multiple target labels (*the*, *quick*, *fox*, and *jumps*). How can we train a model on this data using one-hot vectors and a standard softmax output layer? If we give the model (*brown*, *fox*), and it answers *quick*, then that is wrong. But if we give the model (*brown*, *quick*) and it answers *fox*, then that is also wrong. It's hard to see how the parameters could ever converge in this situation, since there is no reliably correct output for any given input.

Sorry for the long, detailed post, but this seems like a glaring problem with the skip-gram approach, yet it's glossed over in all the explanations that I've read. I'm sure I'm missing something. Any clarification would be most appreciated. Thanks.",4,5,False,self,,,,,

I know that there are tons of data science MOOC's and youtube videos and articles, but to me it feels like most if not all use data science as a motivation to teach programming, or math, or just computers in general. I'm not really interested in a ""here's what a function is, now use that function to load a csv file, then make a plot and a correlation matrix, boom you're a data scientist"".

Are there any more advanced books that don't explain all of the basics but show in a bit more detail how to actually do the ""practical"" part of ML? Every book I own tries to explain things like how to solve the dual problem for an SVM, but none really explain how to look at data and what to do to it before I stick it in the SVM.

Having looked over at Kaggle a bit, I found a few notebooks that look like [this](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python) and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic), which link to the [Multivariate Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Joseph-Hair/dp/9332536503/) book. Is this what I'm looking for? Or is there like a complete area of data analysis that is disjoint from ML?

---

Sorry if I'm using the term  _data science_ term wrongly for this, but I'm not really sure how to call it. People always say that things like feature engineering are part of ML, but then there are literally tens or even hundreds of ML books that go in depth on everything but that (just as an example).",8,5,False,self,,,,,

I am studying a MSc in Applied Statistics and my master thesis is called ""Unsupervised learning techniques applied to classification of gymnasts through the measuring of individual
elements from acrobatic gymnastic discipline"". That is, I would need to have an index, citations, plots, math (for the theoretical background of machine learning models) and so on. I am going to use Python for the developing. However, I am still thinking about which sofwtare should I use for typing purposes. There are three options that I have taken in account:

1-. Latex + PythonTex

2 -. Jupyter notebook + pandoc

3-. R studio + kntir + reticulate

Regarding the first option, the main inconvenient is that coding has to be developed outside Latex (for testing) and then it has to be pasted in Latex, which results in a loss of hyphenation (at least that happened when I first used it) and the consequent loss of time for making it again. 

With respect to the 2nd option, I have read that citations can be used using latex system and there is even a package for live citations using zotero, but I am not sure how effective would it be to make certain things, as an index.

Finally, I am not even sure 3rd option is possible. I know that through reticulate package in combination with kntir, you can make a Markdown document in R studio using Python code, but I don't know if it is also possible to create a R Sweave document. In negative case, Markdown would be sufficient over Sweave for my task?

The Neural Network decides what actions to perform in-game, then evaluates the success of those actions. Then it stores a snapshot of the scenario it was in at the time of executing the action, and a value that indicates the success level of that action. This forms the basis of my training set.

I've noticed something happen that I can only explain by calling it ""learned constriction"". What I mean by this is that once the NN learns that something doesn't work in a given scenario enough times it'll just never try it again. This game has a lot of randomness elements to it, meaning the data produced will be quite noisy. Rather than just slowing down the learning rate of the NN, I would like to implement something to make it experiment a bit with what actions it tries to perform.

I'm wondering if there's something like ""standard procedure"" for this type of scenario to combat incorrect modeling of noisy data in an online learning model. Is simple occasional random selection of what action to perform enough? Ideally I would be able to measure its in-game performance while also experimenting, but that's the best case scenario.

As part of a first-year CS project I've deployed an object detection model (MobileNet + SSD) running on a Raspberry Pi CPU. The overall detection performance + runtime performance (0.8~1.2 FPS detection) was surprisingly good.

The use case was to identify users by their face and identify the object they were holding, if it belongs to one of two categories of recyclable trash. For this we hand labelled 1034 images. 

YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06DGkJ8wYK0&amp;feature=youtu.be

To make the video stream look more presentable we had multiple threads: one for the video capture, one for bounding box detection and one for the rendering of the latest frame + bounding box.

We applied transfer learning to a MobileNet with ImageNet weights (aided mainly by https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2) and then proceeded to deploy it on a Raspberry Pi with a heavily optimised image processing pipeline (as much as we can get with just Python). I was expected sub 1FPS performance + lousy detection so I was really pleased by what we managed to achieve (in addition to having to run a Kivy GUI.

After all this I haven been really undecided to where I want to finally go as a profressional programmer.

A lot of people has talk to me about machine learning but not to much in deep but also I liked almost everything I heard about it. I had some project that I want to use for learning (I think the best idea to learn something is actually practicing with it) and its basically a way to suggest new music according on what you listen, basically like the Spotify Discovery Weekly.

Could someone recommend me some start point or some route I could follow to understanding it properly? Any link or book is welcome. I'm not afraid to go in deep, all the opposite I'm very motivated about this.

Thank you very much in advance :D

However Google did not release the weights for all thoses networks, so a community has formed trying to reproduce and maybe improve the AlphaZero engine.


To do this, a distributed effort to play self-play games has started, and the training is done on a single powerful computer (It can update the weights in about 5 hours currently).


You can see the self-play ELO curve (not representative of real ELO) on the [website](http://lczero.org/).


If you want to help the project by sharing your GPU/CPU, think about following the instructions on the ""Getting Started"" section of the website.

As of now, it would take about ~400 days to reach the 44.000.000 games played by Deepmind, but that could change thanks to you!

I am currently doing a literature review on TS analysis.

One of the papers(linked below) I have read explains using a LSTM RNN that takes trend lines(slope and duration) as input and a CNN that takes the individual prices during each of those trend lines and combining the results into an output that predicts the next trend line.

I understand that they do feature fusion and combine the outputs. My question is what would be the best way to implement this using Scikit Learn?

Any advice would be appreciated!

for the purpose of my bachelor thesis, I'm trying to recreate a machine learning part of well-known paper published by Frey and Osborne called: **[The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)**. I've already manged to get some results, but at the same time I have a lot of second thoughts and issues, with which I think you can help me. These are the most important:

They've hand-labeled 70 observations, which accounts for 10% of all rows, which is understandable since the data source wasn't designed to measure automation impact. Then, they train their models on those data and **test every model 100 times on samples from training data** (50% of labeled observations). My question is: is that a proper approach and if not, what would be better ? Maybe it's better to use 50% of labeled observation (it's relatively small number, like 30) and test it on those which has left. Using authors approach with logistic regression my classifier's AUC is on average equal to 0.94.

Another thing that worries me is **correlation matrix, with most values close to or higher than 0.5**. Clearly it suggests a relationship between the variables. Does this not interfere with the use of the probabilistic classification model (gaussian process classifier) used by the authors ?

Also, what bothers me is the fact that as far as logistic regression is concerned, only two variables are statisticly important.

Thank you for your time.

To me, it would make more sense to instead try to estimate passing the probability distribution through the network. Especially if the loss is MSE, the expected loss is just a function of output expectation and (co-)variance, which are easy to pass through affine functions. Activation inputs should be approximately gaussian for large-ish nets (because CLT) so expectation and variance can be approximated using a gaussian assumption. Other loss functions such as log-likelihood depend on the distribution shape but could also be estimated using a gaussian assumption.

Given a sequence of vectors (video, sound, word embedded text) find the approximately most common successive pair of vectors. How would you do this? 

My best approaches is k-means or maybe some sort of RNN solution. The problem with k-means is that I can't find any guarantees that it will actually find the most common pair rather than just a couple of cluster centroids.

In both approaches I would start with concatenating the vectors of the pair into a new vector and then try to find the mode of the density distribution of the new vectors w.

    sequence = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)
    pair_i = (v_i, v_i+1)

I made a read-only subreddit to cataloge the main threads from these posts for easy look up

https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPapersQandA/

I decided to combine the two types of threads since they're pretty similar in concept. 

I'll only be answering questions that were submitted within 24 hours of this being posted (9:30 am PST). Other people will be answering questions too like last time, but since posts are only on the front page for about a day, if you don't post a question within 24 hours you'll probably have to wait until Round 3 of this, which will happen in 2-3 weeks. To follow tentative dates, you can check this subreddit I use to catalog the topics discussed in my paperHelp/paperFind/paperWrite posts.

I'll only be answering questions that follow the format below. The purpose of this format is to minimize the time it takes to answer a question, maximizing the number of questions that'll be answered. The idea is that if someone who knows the answer reads your post, they should at least know what your asking for without having to open the paper. There are likely experts who pass by this thread, who may be too limited on time to open a paper link, but would be willing to spend a minute or two to answer a question.

In general I understand this approach to automatic differentiation of decomposing a function into primitive operations, but from an implementation standpoint I am curious as to how this decomposition occurs. The example in autograd uses a `tanh` function defined in regular python, so I imagine the package must have some way of breaking the python up into these kinds of primitive operations?

One piece I was confused on / would love further thoughts.  They write:

""P.6 Realistically Small Validation Sets. An unusual artefact
of the way artificial SSL datasets are created is that
often the validation set (data used for tuning hyperparameters
and not model parameters) is significantly larger than
the training set. For example, the standard SVHN (Netzer
et al., 2011) dataset has a validation set of roughly 7,000
labeled examples. Many papers that evaluate SSL methods
on SVHN use only 1,000 labels from the training dataset
but retain the full validation set. The validation set is thus
over seven times bigger than the training set. Of course,
in real-world applications, this large validation set would
instead be used as the training set. This issue was pointed
out, but not addressed, in (Rasmus et al., 2015). The primary
issue with this approach is that any objective values
(e.g. accuracy) used for hyperparameter tuning would be
significantly noisier across runs due to the smaller sample
size resulting from using a realistically small validation set.
In these settings, extensive hyperparameter tuning may be
somewhat futile due to an excessively small collection of
held-out data to measure performance on. In many cases,
even using cross-validation may be insufficient and additionally
incurs a substantial computational cost.""

On first pass this makes sense--however, if keeping more data in the validation set leads to better training results...wouldn't that be the correct choice in ""real-world applications""?",13,7,False,self,,,,,

This is not really used in medicine to predict fracture risk, so I would say it is quite impossible for a radiologist to assess the risk by just interpreting the X-ray. My first results in this project show the same - image analysis does no better prediction by looking at regular risk factors (alcohol intake, smoking, body weight, certain drugs, age, etc). I need to also mention, that such X-ray images are used to assess bone mineral density, which somehow can be used to predict bone fracture, although not perfectly. Bone mineral density is calculated as the average pixel intensity in a certain region of the bone.
So, the question is - can a convnet see things that humans cannot? Can it be trained to see things that are impossible to interpret by humans? If yes, what would be the examples of it?

* **Xcessiv**: Similar to what I want, but the [walkthrough](http://xcessiv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/walkthrough.html) says that I need to define the dataset as a function that returns a tuple. This is unfeasible for huge amounts of data.

Let's also say that I care about data efficiency and learning as quickly as possible.  RL is a motivating example for me, but I think it applies more generally.  

Now let's say that on this type of data, a noisy/stochastic regularizer, like dropping a fraction of the visible units, would normally work well.  

In the non-stationary case, it seems like there's a weakness in applying a stochastic regularizer like this, because you're losing information about data which won't be as relevant in the future (due to non-stationarity).  

For the usual classification setup, it's not an issue to regularize as much as possible, at least from a data efficiency point of view, because the same data points can always be visited later in training and they'll have the same relevance.  ",2,8,False,self,,,,,

For a while I've been thinking that few shot learning tasks are not really enough to distinguish optimization based approaches from model based metalearning approaches given that RNNs can do them just as well. And there is the ever present question of what would you get if you combine the two.

To that end, it might be interesting to try out training a autoencoder not by optimizing the reconstruction loss, but just by switching the labels and the inputs. If my understanding of what meta-optimization is doing, then it might be plausible that inputs could be omitted entirely and the network would still do useful learning.

Would this kind of task be a good match for meta-optimization approaches?

This question was inspired by some of the recent papers I read that claim the brain to be doing Bayesian inference rather than maximum likelihood estimation. In [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6hXF3EMv_E&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLgKuh-lKre115020ug_gdmRroIfiQsPL4&amp;t=0s) Asja Fisher claims that one update of a energy based model approximates backpropagation.

mu_t = alpha\*x_t + (1-alpha)\*mu_t-1,

 where mu is the exponential moving average. It seems like a simple 1 cell RNN should be able to easily and exactly approximate this. As you can see in [ this gist however](https://gist.github.com/HristoBuyukliev/678152c504f5e917887c2fb1ea52778e) it very much does not. The closest thing I could get it to learn was some sort of random walk - i.e. predicting the previous value of x. Even this behaviour is very rare and unstable. 

I tried using more layers/units (even though that's not the point), different learning rates, optimizers, rolled vs. unrolled version, different activations and initializations. Not only is not the RNN not able to learn this simple function, but it often performs *very* poorly - e.g. the input data is between -10, +10, and it predicts values between 0 and -400. Also, the activation is linear, so it should be very difficult/impossible to get stuck in local minima?

I'm coming to you guys because I don't really have anyone else. I'm in an odd situation, and I would very much appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and think about it. 

I have a Ph.D in experimental psychology. I went into psychology because I want to understand how people work. However, after about a year of my Ph.D, I started working at a startup and discovered programming; I fell in love. And later, I realized that the quote left on Feynman's blackboard - ""What I cannot create, I do not understand"" is incredibly true of people. I found Silver's lectures on RL and everything clicked into place. All the programming and math with all the neuroscience I love. *This is what I want to do for the rest of my life.*

But, I already have one Ph.D. I've self-taught my way a decently far way. I can program most RNN variants from scratch and in tensorflow, I can read a paper and implement it - I mostly stick to biologically plausible models out of Bengio's lab - and work through Sutton's book. I work as a data scientist. Aside from that, my strength has always been in creativity - I take things and change them, or do something entirely different. It's made me a good psychological scientist (I finished my PhD in less than three years, got published in my field's top journal, etc), and I'm sure I would do well in AI research.

The problem is that I have a job that pays well and a new family, and cleverness and creativity are not enough in a field with as much depth and challenge as this; excellence is not at all a part-time affair. I've tried waking up at 4 for some time and doing a few hours of work before work, I've taken Coursera courses and bought books (e.g. PGMs by Daphne Koller), but... to get a job in this area, you have to publish, you have to know people, and you have to have the strong sort of foundation earned through a decade of work in universities. I would say I lack that foundation - in complex calculus, in proofs, in probability - and I lack real concrete proof that I can produce paper-worthy work. Both those things deserve and require a great amount of time that my life does not currently allow. You also maybe need to know people in the field, and ... that is difficult. My life up to this point has not crossed with computer scientists or mathematicians. I have to cold email, and so far that hasn't gone well. The only person to respond was Robert Sutton who replied *immediately* and scheduled a call the next day, then wasn't there for the call and never responded again (I get the feeling he's one of those incredibly energetic and inevitably overcommitted people who has ten thousand people clamoring for his time). I guess I miss having a mentor.

In short: I love what you guys do, and I would really love to do it too. I'm just afraid it will take a large leap, and I don't want to put my family's well-being at too much risk for a personal want. 

If you were in my position, what would you do? Save up enough to take a year off, and quit the job? Go back to school? Try desperately to create in your spare time? I'm 31 now, and I feel like the feel is moving so quickly I'm just never going to catch up and contribute to this wonderful field.

One can theoretically apply a NN with the parameter budget just right for this size of the dataset without having to rely on any regularization technique. However, in reality we have to rely on regularization techniques (unless the dataset is too large), which means that the NN we use tends to be slightly overparametrized. Is this because it's easier to adjust the hyperparameters of the regularization techniques than the parameter size? Or is it because slightly overparametrized NN with reg. techniques has a better generalization capability due to some theoretical reason? How do we decide a given dataset is so large that we shouldn't use any reg. technique? Transformer paper used dropout even though WMT 2014 En-Fr dataset is so large. Is it resource-dependent, i.e. if you have enough GPU memory, is it recommended to use reg. techniques and more than enough parameters?

What started as a hobby and curiosity project to learn more about linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning and a young programming language called Nim became a huge evening time sink.

After implementing Numpy-like ndarrays, Torch/Tensorflow like primitives, I just finalised the first part of my high-level API which hopefully takes the best from Keras and PyTorch.

Id like your feedback on that. Quick note on Nim, it is a strongly typed language, hence why you see f32/float32 from time to time.

For example, declaring a two-layers NN currently is like this:

    # ##################################################################
    # Environment variables
    
    # N is batch size; D_in is input dimension;
    # H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
    let (N, D_in, H, D_out) = (64, 1000, 100, 10)
    
    # Create the autograd context that will hold the computational graph
    let ctx = newContext Tensor[float32]
    
    # Create random Tensors to hold inputs and outputs, and wrap them in Variables.
    let
      x = ctx.variable(randomTensor[float32](N, D_in, 1'f32))
      y = randomTensor[float32](N, D_out, 1'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Define the model.
    
    network ctx, TwoLayersNet:
      layers:
        fc1: Linear(D_in, H)
        fc2: Linear(H, D_out)
      forward x:
        x.fc1.relu.fc2
    
    let
      model = ctx.init(TwoLayersNet)
      optim = model.optimizerSGD(learning_rate = 1e-4'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Training
    
    for t in 0 ..&lt; 500:
      let
        y_pred = model.forward(x)
        loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)
    
      echo &amp;""Epoch {t}: loss {loss.value[0]}""
    
      loss.backprop()
      optim.update()
This is a port of Jcjohnson PyTorch example: https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples#pytorch-autograd.

3 examples are available directly in my repo: https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/tree/master/examples.

A MNIST simple convnet with 2 conv layers, 1 hidden layer and automatic shape inference would be like this:

    randomize(42) # Random seed for reproducibility
    
    let
      ctx = newContext Tensor[float32] # Autograd/neural network graph
      n = 32                           # Batch size
    
    let
      x_train = read_mnist_images(""build/train-images.idx3-ubyte"").astype(float32) / 255'f32
      X_train = ctx.variable x_train.unsqueeze(1) # Change shape from [N, H, W] to [N, C, H, W], with C = 1
    
      y_train = read_mnist_labels(""build/train-labels.idx1-ubyte"").astype(int)
    
      x_test = read_mnist_images(""build/t10k-images.idx3-ubyte"").astype(float32) / 255'f32
      X_test = ctx.variable x_test.unsqueeze(1) Change shape from [N, H, W] to [N, C, H, W], with C = 1
      y_test = read_mnist_labels(""build/t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte"").astype(int)
    
    network ctx, DemoNet:
      layers:
        x:          Input([1, 28, 28])
        cv1:        Conv2D(x.out_shape, 20, 5, 5)
        mp1:        MaxPool2D(cv1.out_shape, (2,2), (0,0), (2,2))
        cv2:        Conv2D(mp1.out_shape, 50, 5, 5)
        mp2:        MaxPool2D(cv2.out_shape, (2,2), (0,0), (2,2))
        hidden:     Linear(mp2.out_shape.flatten, 500)
        classifier: Linear(500, 10)
      forward x:
        x.cv1.relu.mp1.cv2.relu.mp2.flatten.hidden.relu.classifier
    
    let model = ctx.init(DemoNet)
    let optim = model.optimizerSGD(learning_rate = 0.01'f32)
    
    . &lt; Training loop &gt; 
    
So what I would like to know is:

   - If you could do it yourself what syntax would you prefer to use for which use cases?
   - What do you think of my network declaration section?

I have to maintain and develop multiple models to classify time series data. Right now the procedure to develop a new classifier is:

1) assemble a training set of 20K time series examples for class ""A"" and 1-5K time series examples for class ""B"" (or as many class ""B"" examples as possible).

2) Extract thousands of different time series features using a time series feature extraction package. Manually engineer some time series features (this takes time and domain specific knowledge!).

3) Use different algorithms to determine feature importances - grab only the 200-500 most important features.

4) train decision tree model on most important time series features using cross validation + bagging.

5) Deploy model to real time data streams and evaluate results.

The issue with this procedure is that often I have to come up with time series features by hand in step 2 above. I have to do clever, domain knowledge specific feature engineering manually.

Would using an LSTM instead save some time in this process or are there other issues that arise that make building an LSTM classifier take about the same amount of time?",0,1,False,self,,,,,
