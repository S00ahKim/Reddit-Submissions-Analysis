I'm trying to put together a list of machine learning labs that are open to hiring post-undergraduates for a summer or a longer period of time. These can be labs at companies, universities, research institutes, government entities, etc. Personally, I'm interested in ones that (a) aren't incredibly hard to get into, and (b) are focused on research in deep learning or reinforcement learning. Either way, I think a comprehensive list would probably be appreciated by the community too. To start off, I'll list the places I know of (which unfortunately don't really satisfy (a)):

* OpenAI - You can apply at https://openai.com/jobs/ for the Fellow position. 
* MILA - You can apply at https://mila.quebec/en/admission/ for the Intern position. This is Yoshua Bengio's lab. I think it would help to speak French, though it doesn't seem to be required.
* Vector Institute - This is the brand new AI lab associated with Toronto, Guelph, and Ontario in general. There are no internship positions yet, but given the text on http://vectorinstitute.ai/#Opportunities it seems like there might be some next year or the following year.

Hopefully we can find others that might take people who aren't already very well qualified. I just sort of developed this plan, so if I find any more, I'll be sure to update this post.

To give some background, for the past three months, I've been preparing to apply to grad schools for a PhD in machine learning. I've gotten everything sorted out (GRE, letters, research experience, apps, etc.), and decided to look at some recently admitted PhD students to see how I stack up... at which point, my confidence deflated like an overcooked souffle :( I've realized that I'm really no match for these students, and that I probably don't have a fighting chance of getting in anywhere that has an RL or DL group--even at schools ranked around #40 on csrankings.org, which I thought would be safeties for me. So, after the rejections arrive, I'm planning on developing some research ideas I've had over the next six months on my own, and then applying to an internship at a lab--hence this post--and, finally, reapplying in one or two years for PhD or funded MS w/thesis programs. And I'd *definitely* appreciate any comments on the feasibility of this plan if anyone has related experience/knowledge.

Thanks!

**Update 1:** Thanks to u/chaitjo, who contributed the following ideas:

* Google Brain Residency (or AI Residency).
* Microsoft NERD AI Program.
* Personal connections with academic labs.
* Various roles at companies like Maluuba, Element AI, Vicarious, etc. (may have to be an ML developer there, instead of an intern).",14,9,False,self,,,,,

As suggested by many people here and also people such as Andrej Karpathy ( [source] (https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/708480082831024128)) I tried converting it to a classification problem to avoid a L2 loss function and that greatly improved performance (Note: I previously tried different data transform to make the L2 loss work, but couldn't get there). Intuitively, I would assume the loss function is less prone to having as many local minima and a less ""erratic"" shape due to the discretization compared to the L2 loss? 

However, do you know of any papers that explored the performance differences between plain regression loss functions and converting to a classification problem? 
Or, more generally, papers that analyze shortcomings of a L2 loss in a way that implies that avoiding it might be beneficial?

I read the PixelRNN paper ([pdf] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf)), where they did something similar and am inclined to just reference it, but it seems a bit thin to just point to one paper, where this was beneficial too.

The intention is to use the SOM to reduce the dimensionality of the data (to a single vector with winning neurons/best matching unit) and use that in further analysis.   

Unfortunately, I dont have access to Matlab, or statistica and I'm not a massive fan of R)...so it sort of needs to be Python/Tensorflow.   

I am aware of a few tutorials on applying SOM's to the iris dataset or a series of RGB values etc, have spent a lot of time googling, but couldn't seem to find any examples on how to deal with the time series aspect of spectral data. Additionally, I know there are published papers that do use spectral speech data in SOM's, so it is possible, but from what I have read, they dont include sufficient detail about how to deal with the time series/multidimensionality aspect of it. In short, I'm just not sure how to go about it practically.

I'm in the process of finalizing a PC build for doing my own ML research. I'm a 4th year undergrad in computational engineering applying to get a masters in ML. Most of my research, at the moment, focuses on deep convolutional nets and GANs. I was wondering if you could have a look through this build and see if there are any glaring errors in it so that I can address them before getting the parts:

I've noticed a lot of nepotism in the field that should be addressed.

At the Deep RL Symposium at NIPS this year, 7 out of the 12 contributed talks come from two groups at Berkeley. While these two groups have many papers in the symposium, there are more than 80 accepted papers in total from many different groups that could have been highlighted. The selection process for papers was double blind, but I can't help but doubt the process for picking who gets a talk. Particularly because 3 out of 6 of the symposium organizers are associated in some way with these labs.

I think it is great that RL has finally reached this level of popularity, but I also think we have to be careful about how the research is disseminated.",112,332,False,self,,,,,

Basically; I'm implementing this facial point paper for work; and it uses spatial softargmax (just a layer that takes in a stack of images a lot like [this](https://i.imgur.com/YILPB6H.png) - and it returns the most ""intense part"" of the image (so just the x,y coordinates of the white blob). It takes in an array with 68 of these images (all 1 channel, so the array is 100x100x68) and it gives 68 pairs of x,y coordinates for each one - these end up being the facial points.

The layer I have written in keras to do this is;

    class spatial_softArgmax(Layer):
    
    		def __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):
    				self.output_dim = 136#output_dim
    				super(spatial_softArgmax, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    				# Create a trainable weight variable for this layer.

    					super(spatial_softArgmax, self).build(input_shape)  # Be sure to call this somewhere!

    			def call(self, x):
    					filters = x
    					temperature = 1.0
    					shape = tf.shape(filters)
    					height, width, num_channels = shape[1], shape[2], shape[3]

    					posx, posy = tf.meshgrid(tf.lin_space(-1., 1., num = height),
    																	 tf.lin_space(-1., 1., num = width),
    																	 indexing='ij')
    					posx = tf.reshape(posx, [height * width])
    					posy = tf.reshape(posy, [height * width])

    					filters = tf.reshape(tf.transpose(filters, [0, 3, 1, 2]), [-1, height * width])

    					softmax_attention = tf.nn.softmax(filters / temperature)

    					expected_x = tf.reduce_sum(posx * softmax_attention, 1, keep_dims = True)
    					expected_y = tf.reduce_sum(posy * softmax_attention, 1, keep_dims = True)

    					expected_xy = tf.concat([expected_x, expected_y], axis = 1)

    					feature_keypoints = tf.reshape(expected_xy, [-1, num_channels * 2])

    					return feature_keypoints


    			def get_config(self):

It isn't working though; like at all; I keep getting this error that says 'None Values not supported' - which makes me think that my layer isn't returning anything?? I dug around in the TF code a bit around where this exception is raise but didn't really find much...

Is my intuition correct that this would make so that the model would classify more based on what was segmented in the training set?

For image classification problems on which the pattern being classified for is more ""discrete"", would this make so less data is required?

What is the name of this approach? Is this something very well known? Are there any famous paper on this?

Let's get straight to the point : yesterday, NVIDIA released an open source[ pytorch implementation of flownet2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch), which released a CUDA version of the correlation layer introduced by the paper [FlowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852). It turns out out that this code is protected by NVIDIA copyright while it heavily reuse parts of a code I wrote myslef 6 months ago : [FlowNet Pytorch](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch)

My goal is not to rant or to fulfil my self esteem, but to figure what to do in the most pragmatic manner in order to take the best of both worlds and make the best implementation possible.

That's not the most important part, but as a proof, here are some comparisons you can make :

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/607f99f46be3eccbd9b07c73848a68bc12156392/multiscaleloss.py#L8) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46)

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L32) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/FlowNetS.py#L11)

[mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L9) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/submodules.py#L7)

Now as a disclaimer, I am very honoured they decided to use my code, and it is very obvious that my code is not rocket science and the main contribution of this project is not these little snippets but rather the custom layers and the pretrained weights for pytorch.

However, the fact that the README is not giving any credit for what I did feels a little uncool, especially with a [License file](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE) saying that all copyright goes to NVIDIA.

My other concern is that the parts of the code that got copied were actually not very well written, and the implementation in my own repo is to my mind much better now (for example [`MulstiScaleLoss`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46) module is a nightmare to read and to use while pytorch gives tools for making it [much more readable](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/master/multiscaleloss.py#L15)). I could make several Pull Requests but it's not garanteed to be merged rapidly and I'd prefer to contact the author first to get things straight and make them know that all I want is the best flownet2 implementation, and as this project is already gaining a lot of stars, it would be pointless to do my own fork ^with ^blackjack ^and ^hookers

My huge mistake was maybe to not have put a License in my code in the first place, but apparently, [a default one still holds](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license).

So what would be the best to do to get to work constructively with the project authors to improve their implementation and maybe also get a little credit for the code on which they built this project ? (also, is my claim reasonable ?)

Thanks in advance for your help !

EDIT thanks for your comments, I'll contact the main committor of the repo and hopefully everything will be alright! I am glad to see that it was indeed a reasonable claim",79,101,False,self,,,,,

I was wondering if this could be a possibility with machine learning. I'm interested in learning this subject and have some ideas. This one idea to have the ability for geometric shapes to be recognized, or patterns of these shapes to be identified where human eyes may not be trained to see them. Can anyone give me an idea of what would be a way to go about this? I have a specific image in mind, but I think this could be used in many cases.

It seems plausible that it might just work without tweaking the net, but I'm also considering that in the 2D conv case, it's not so easy to tack on a bit, so merging that bit after the conv gets flattened sounds plausible.

Natural starting points would be clustering into similar trajectories (I guess dynamic time warping + knn might be appropriate), trying to find anomalies, maybe predicting destinations of partial trajectories... I started thinking about this after seeing the bike sharing kaggle competition from a few years back -- surely there's much more to do here, that was just predicting demand as a function of time/location using pickup/dropoff point histories.

I'm currently doing research with customer data. The focus is on customer churn prediction and lead scoring. Microsoft Azure is used and the results achieved are amazingly good - like storybook good. The models (Decision Jungle) achieve 99% and 93% respectively with ~ 20 features and only 40% of the data for training.  
Never did I expect to achieve such results in the real world. Is there something like the accuracy paradox that could be at work here, or am I just too inexperienced to not expect such results ?   
**Updates:**
Original data : 325,000 rows   
Train data : 230,000 rows (0.7)   
Test data : 98,000 rows (0.3)   
% of churned customers : 16  
I'm currently checking whether there is a feature that is ""unfair""  
For lead scoring there were only two features which determined the result. I dropped them and am now at 97% with a bunch of features influencing the result. Still seem pretty darn good :/  
**Thanks everyone for the help !**

Summary:  
- Check that the training and validation sets are split correctly  
- Make sure to not use unfair features  
- Handle imbalance  
- Only SMOTE with training data  
- Split data per customer",20,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm not completely sure what the final conclusion is, but the fact that these peeps are (mostly) from Julia Computing and that [Julia now has capability to compile CUDA kernels on the fly](http://mikeinnes.github.io/2017/08/24/cudanative.html) is pretty interesting...

I'm pretty damn close to giving Julia and [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) a serious try (I just need some *time* dammit...).

Given that I had already spent the time to collate most of the necessary information for [Open Review Explorer](https://chillee.github.io/OpenReviewExplorer/index.html?conf=iclr2017), I thought that it wouldn't be too hard for me to do some basic analysis :) If you want to do some analysis yourself, check out the json files at https://github.com/Chillee/OpenReviewExplorer
#Wins for Arxiv Sanity
####Adversarial examples in the physical world (Citations: 99, Rating: 5.60)
Despite a couple of notable authors, this pretty cool paper from google and openAI was pushed to the Workshop track by ICLR. The decision: 
&gt;In light of the reviews, the main critique of this work is its lack of significance, relative to existing works in adversarial examples....The AC concludes that the potential practical applications, while not significant enough to be part of the conference proceedings, are worthy to be disseminated in the workshop. I therefore recommend submitting this work to the workshop track.


#### Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks (Citations: 78, Rating: 5.07)
This paper was somewhat weird in that it was apparently on ArXiv far before being submitted to ICLR (one of the criticisms). Given that, I think it's fair to give ICLR reviewers some slack on this.

# Losses for both ICLR and Arxiv Sanity
#### Squeezenet (Citations: 226, Rating: 6.27)
Despite being the most cited paper period from ICLR 2017 (by quite some margin), it received ratings of (5,7,7) and a Reject decision. Arxiv Sanity users didn't seem to be ahead of the curve on this one either. I thought that perhaps it had been revised and submitted for another conference, but I couldn't find anything on that.

#### Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD (Citations: 71, Rating: 5.73)

### The Google effect
One thing I noticed looking at the [list](https://chillee.github.io/OpenReviewExplorer/?conf=iclr2017) of most cited papers is that of the top cited papers that were rejected, many had Google affiliation. Perhaps there is an anti-google bias among reviewers, or perhaps Google papers get cited more than they deserve to be.

# Final Results 
Actual ICLR papers: 4419 total citations  
Papers sorted by Arxiv Sanity: 4229 total citations

So under this metric, ICLR is still doing a better job than Arxiv Sanity . Sorry Karpathy :)

PS: I realize citation counts are not the end all be all of judging a paper's importance. However, it tends to be a pretty good metric and one of the best objective ones we have.",10,12,False,self,,,,,

Caffe only supports data parallelism for training and PyTorch i haven't tried yet.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for advice on whether or not doing a ML-focused PhD would be a good idea for me. The typical advice I see on more general academic sub like /r/AskAcademia is that you should do a PhD only if you want a career in research, but I decided to post here because I get the impression that there is a smoother continuum between ""research"" and ""industry"" in machine learning (and maybe even in CS more broadly) than in most other fields (please do let me know if this impression is incorrect).
 
&amp;nbsp;

Currently I'm employed as a research engineer in a great machine learning group at a university in the USA. I enjoy my job, but I don't imagine staying as an engineer here for the long term. I have a good relationship with the lab's director, and he has has offered to take me on as a PhD student (as well as to support my application to other programs, if I decide to do that).

&amp;nbsp; 

My end goal is to land a job in a research lab at an established tech company (in the USA). I would ideally like to strike a balance between interesting work and salary, and my interests are skewed towards practical applications over theory.

&amp;nbsp;

From the above paragraph, the standard response I would expect is something along the lines of this: ""do a Masters, because a Masters is about application, and a PhD is about research."" This makes sense to me, but there are a few other factors that are leading to my ambivalence:
 
&amp;nbsp;

First, I very much enjoy my research, but it's not clear if this means that I like ""doing research"", or if it means that I like ""being a research engineer."" Being an engineer (as opposed to being a student) means that even my research projects have tended to have real-world users and applications, and have tended to be highly collaborative, which I really like. I worry that becoming a PhD student (in my current group or otherwise) will strip away much of the parts that I enjoy. That being said, as things currently stand, I think I would enjoy the process of continuing my current research towards a dissertation.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Second, although I don't necessarily see myself making a career out of publishing papers, my impression is that certain leadership roles at industrial research labs are essentially reserved for PhDs, even if their primary function is not to produce publications. I worry about limiting myself, career-wise, if I skip the PhD.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So, the question is: if you were me, would you continue towards the PhD? or would you try to get industrial research roles in the near future?
 
&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading. I look forward to hearing your opinions.",35,7,False,self,,,,,

This is especially helpful at the beginning of the training process where badly chosen initialization may lead to vanishing or exploding signal in the network. Once the network is trained the batch norm in test time uses moving averages of estimated mean and variance of training population i.e. it applies simple linear transformation. So here are the questions which come to my mind:

* Did anyone try to compare estimated values of mean and variance, with those computes from whole training set (i.e. not by moving averages)? I'm wonder how this would affect test accuracy. Additionally, how sure can we be that those estimates are optimal for test performance?

* Secondly, once the network is trained, why don't we replace batch norm with linear transformation of form: bn(x) = gamma * x + beta, with gamma/beta being parameters used during test time and then fine tune them using regular gradient descent approach? 

I just wanted to ask experts here, before I will waste a few hours of my life on trying things which already have been done.

E.g one data row might say that for a group for 4 students, a total of 300 points were earned on the exam, and of those students, 1 lives more than 5km from the school, 3 live closer than 5km; 2 have siblings in the school, the other 2 do not, etc. My goal is to train a model that helps me learn the features that best predict *individual* student performance and rank all students in terms of their expected contributions to my (known) buckets of scores. In other words, given many buckets of students and their aggregate scores, how can I learn a function to distribute the total bucket score (300) to a group of N students (eg for N=4, scores of 100,80,20,100). The goal is to learn what features predict high-scoring students (perhaps living close to the school) and then to use that function to predict who the high scoring students in that bucket may have been. For a real world use case, this may help a school administrator who only had access to aggregated data to learn a model to predict students to follow up on.

I know I can use a LinearRegressor or RandomForestRegressor to predict individual scores, than redistribute their predicted scores such that sum(predictions_for_bucket) == known_bucket_score, but it seems like a better approach might exist. Does anyone have any tips for solving this type of a problem? It would seem ideal if the predicted values themselves would fall within the known aggregate distribution for the known bucket scores.

Hope this sub is kind to someone learning.

Lets say I am creating a robotic hand to grab things, where how tightly or lightly the fingers grip an item is to be determined. Different fingers might need to use different grip strength based on the shape of the item. Lets also say the alogirthm also needs to decide how many fingers to use, large items need all fingers where as small items like a pen need fewer fingers.

Now lets assume I have other ML/deep learning modules written up that tell me how heavy the object is, how thick it is and its shape. There is no ambiguity here, I need ML/deep learning. I know how strongly I have to grip the item and how many fingers to use and how much to strength I need to give to each finger.

Do I need machine learning to grab the item at this point, which is, to simplify a lot, just pulling strings of each fingers? Or is it a straight up control system that already has the inputs it needs?

How about if the problem changes a bit to account for an incorrect initial estimation of the item size/shape/weight etc? Once the fingers grip it will know if the grip is enough or not and it needs to adjust, do I need ML then? What if the weight/shape/size vary continuously, do I need ML then?

Why does they use a ""cumsum"", to get total number of tp/fp you just need to do ""sum"" right? By doing this, precision and recall won't be a single number but a list/array which shows cumulative scores through no of detections, why is this needed? I'd be delighted if someone can explain.

* Is there currently any service that is able to convert speech to text  when two or more people are talking, and distinguish the source?


For example, lets say Al and Frank are talking in turn, and at some point Al asks a question, but before he finishes his question, Frank starts talking.


Results I'd like:

Voices identified: 2

* P1(VI-1)-time: 0:00-0:01: Hi Al
* P2(VI-2)-time: 0:02-0:03: Hi Frank
* P1(VI-1)-time: 0:04-0:07: How are you doing?
* P2(VI-2)-time: 0:08-**0:13**: Im doing good Frank, how are you doing this sunny morning?
* P1(VI-1)-time: **0:12**-0:17: Great! I just found out I am going to go for a trip.
* P2(VI-2)-time: 0:18-0:24: That is great!
* P2(VI-1)-time: 0:25-0:27: I know!!


If there are currently non with that capacity, does anyone know if there are any projects in the pipelines, that might be coming down in the foreseeable future?

1.    What are their limitations and Drawbacks? (ELI5). They seem to be ""too good"". What are their problems? Where do they fall short? One example was in the paper and discussed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7deq2z/d_eli5_the_drawbacks_of_capsules_m/, but what are others?

2. Why do they still fail Adversarial Attacks? (ELI5).
jaesik817 experimented and their results show CapsNets failed every type of basic adversarial attack. How come? How could they be structured with more resistance or improved against such attacks? https://github.com/jaesik817/adv_attack_capsnet

3. What would be Novel Applications for them? Beyond image recognition, what would they be especially good for or interesting to apply on? Object recognition sounds like a viable route. How about Speech or Music recognition? Textual/NLP analyses? Predictive models for specific types of data/applications? 

4. Also, is there any tiny example implementation of them to a toy problem from scratch? All I could find is Tensorflow and PyTorch implementations, but I want to see a toy implementation for a small problem built without a deep learning framework or not necessitating GPU or days of running. That would help understanding the algorithm, how to modify it for new examples, and playing around with it.

I started to learn more about GANs, and I was trying to understand some code I found online.

I found a code from Siraj Raval with a GAN for handwritten digits using MNIST. The problem is that there is many obscure stuff in the code.

For example, the generator is a deconvolution network, but in his code he uses tf.nn.conv2d and reshape the output. How this work as a deconvolution?

Also, during training, he uses a bunch of if's to optimize the loss of the discriminator and generator. How this work as a game?

His code can be found in this link:

I am working on ML in computer systems, but systems conferences tend to be very conservative regarding new approaches and do not typically care until the approach is ready for real-world usage (which is reflected on the expectations on the evaluation).

For example, the Google device placement opt paper was at ICML 17 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04972). My question is, from studying the paper calls and reading this year's NIPS proceedings, where do people feel, especially as reviewers, is the right place for novel work in application domains? By that I mean work on exploring/understanding approaches in a real-world system without necessarily introducing new mechanics other than interpreting a problem in this new domain in a way it has not been done before, potentially also introducing new datasets/benchmarks. Example again, the Google paper treating device allocation as a machine translation problem.

Looking at this year's NIPS, there do not seem to be many papers of this style, and understandably most reviewers might be sick of 'deep learning on x' papers where not much is to be gained for the community. 

So overall, what do people feel is the right venue, and what can make an application paper interesting?  Particularly from the perspective of PhD students who cannot make their work relevant by it being large scale and pushing the practical limits of systems.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

He simply used simple tricks like adding gaussian noise, or compressing the image etc.
But then simply told that, these too can easily have adversarial examples if the attacker knows the underlying architecture.
The suggestion which came to my mind is can we have some type of trapdoor function which would be determined by some passkey and would allow both forward and backpropagation while training (the passkey is put up in the architecture itself), but publish its weights only. So one can forward propagate, but not back propagate.

How would the scale of weights given to a weighted loss function (assume CrossEntropy) affect the performance of a standard classification task. Based on the imbalance in the dataset, we attain these weights. I'm asking for a simple scenario. Eg: Assume 5 classes are there. w1 is a set of weights obtained using some formula (eg: inverse of population)

w1 = [3, 34, 12, 100, 2]

w2 = w1 / min(w1)

w3 = w1 / max(w1)

This results in 

w2 = [  1.5,  17. ,   6. ,  50. ,   1. ]

w3 = [ 0.03,  0.34,  0.12,  1.  ,  0.02]

What I understand, this approach sets up an _invertable_ series of transformations, resulting that the probability density can be calculated as it is transformed by each step. Ok with that.

What I do not understand is the motivation. The paper says that it wants to give more expressive posteriors that better match the true posterior.  

Several confusions about this:  

1. Why is it necessary? Deep nets are powerful and should be able to transform an input distribution to a desired latent distribution (e.g. the normal distribution in VAE) if given enough layers. 

2. The term ""true posterior"" confuses me! As far as I know, the prior can be specified arbitrarily, and this changes the posterior. Why is there one posterior that is ""true"" and others are not?
I fear I do not know what posterior means, at least in this situation. ",11,11,False,self,,,,,

The goal is that you can do all of the following with one line of code each:

-Search for a dataset

-Get information on a dataset and all the available formats

-Download and initialize the dataset

-Set the format (e.g. of the output batches)

-Get a training/test/validation batch (depending on the format)

-Do pre/post-processing dependent on the format

This is the basic idea, if you know of something already in existence I would love to know about it. But all I could find are some Github Repos that have wrappers for some specific datasets.

What I want to achieve with this post is to get a general sense if this is something the community would actually need or if it is just me. And getting a rough idea of the whole picture and of what it would take to make this useful. And if someone would like to collaborate with me on this.

Workflow example: Lets say I have a project where I want to generate song lyrics and for that I have a dataset of 100k songs. I had to download that dataset manually after quite a bit of searching and when i finally had it, I needed to clean it up and format it in a usable way. And lastly, I have to write a dataset loading, augmentation and batching library to go along with it. Finally the model can be trained! But wait, there is a new paper out describing a new type of model (maybe a LSTM2.0 based, recurrent model with state of the art... blablabla) that I have to try to see if my results will improve. Now let's suppose that my original model took in the raw vectorized characters of the song lyrics and the new model takes in the whole vectorized words. This has to be adjusted, so except for the training, the majority of time spend on testing out the new model goes into rewriting my original dataset loading library or maybe even reformatting the whole data and adjusting my pre and post processing steps to fit the new format.

The idea is that you can visit the project website and search for a dataset by category, keyword, etc. or do that directly from the python terminal using the lib ""libX.search(keywords='nlp,lyrics,songs')"". Then when you want more details on the dataset and the different formations of it (vectorized characters/vectorized words/etc.) you have something like ""libX.dataset_info(dataset_name='100k_rap_lyrics_v1')"" that would return a dictionary of information, you get it. Download and initialize it, ""dataset = libX.init_dataset(dataset_name='100k_rap_lyrics_v1',path='./dataset/path')"" maybe you could also pass in a configuration parameter to e.g. specify how much memory it should take up, or if the whole thing should be loaded into memory, and if it should be split into training, test and validation sets and the percentages of samples for each of these (probably a good default would be required). Then you can set up your formation like this ""dataset.set_format(dataset.formats.vectorized_words,options={""vector_size"":10000,""pre_word_count"":8})"". That would set the format of the dataset and input output correlations returned by ""dataset.get_batch(..."". So when you write ""x,y = dataset.get_batch(batch_size=128)"" x and y would be the input and the desired output, in this case x would have this shape: [batch_size, per_word_count,vector_size] and y: [batch_size,vector_size]. More useful stuff; in pre-processing when you want to convert a sentence into a vector array ""dataset.to_vector('my sentence.')"" or back ""dataset.to_words([word_count,vector_size])"". If you would like to run it after training, ""sentence='This is the beginning'"" ""result = model.run(dataset.to_vector(sentence,length=pre_word_count))"" ""sentence += dataset.to_words(result)[0]"".

It is very important that you have a generalized set of formations, different sentence based datasets should have the same formations available to them. All word/sentence based datasets have formations for text generation, classification, sentiment analysis, etc. The same goes for something like mnist, there you would have formats for classification,generation, etc.

I realize that this is very massive project and my plan is to make it a Github based open source effort. I am sorry for the extend of this post. I don't write many posts on reddit so some tips and tricks are very welcome.",22,28,False,self,,,,,

I got 2 datasets both based on employee movement. One in an office and second in some kind of factory. Both datasets contain data in format like (date,employeeID, x, y, z, velocity), to match these I also got map of both, factory and office, with marked places like workspace, smoke room, kitchen, machines(on factory map), WC, chill room.

And I have been given a task to find a way to use ML and implement something based on one of these datasets. 

At first I was thinking about some classification as smoker or not but based on this data it seems hard to find more groups + I am not convinced if Mall in this case would be even needed.

Then I thought of finding out best time slots to perform machine maintenance since no-one if Woking on that machine. I got 3 machines marked. I was allowed to make any assumptions as long as they are not stupid, so assuming that every time someone is close to machine means he is working on it (and ignoring the fact that some of these is probably maintenance already) there are some time slots for each when noone is there.

One more idea I had is to turn on lights 
in rooms automatically based on room's position, time and if someone is in this room usually at that hour. So if room has no windows and lets say every minute at least 3 people pass through it - lights should be on automatically as we can assume that they will turn it on anyway. Or in one room people are working 6-14 and in other 8-18 then we assume that based on some external data of sunrises the light should be on in 1st room from 6-7:30 and in 2nd from 16-18. Etc

As interesting background it was right after a class where the lecturer said that ML should not be used as default tool for anything but rather to distinguish if your problem can be solved by ML. Anyway task is a task and I have to do that :)

Does any of my ideas seem ""good enough"" or maybe could you share your ideas please? Thanks!",5,4,False,self,,,,,

From what I can tell, this joke is the entirety of the ""inappropriate behavior"" that is supposed to have happened at NIPS. 

This has ushered in a series of actions from the NIPS program committee, including formalized procedures for reporting such incidents in the future.

I don't think policing inappropriate jokes is a step in a good direction. I think it is an extremist step to mitigate what should be a non-issue.

Having a conference that is nice for everyone involves being mindful of how our behavior affect other people, but it also involves being tolerant of other peoples flaws, quirks and missteps. 

Some people will make lame jokes. Pick a random respected comedian, and chances are you will hear them talk about death, mental illness, racism, the holocaust, and yes: sexual assault. The dark and painful is exactly what we make our jokes about. Telling a joke is fundamentally about taking a risk, you don't know if it will land with your audience until is told out loud. Sometimes it sounds good in your head, and sounds bad when it comes out. 

The punishment for this should not be public crucifixion. We should simply shrug our shoulders, shake our heads, and move on with our lives, like the grown ups we are.

A naive way is to concatenate the new feature with the original data matrix, then feed the N*(D+1) data matrix into the model, and decide to add or discard the new feature by comparing the model performances(accuracy, loss, etc) on validation dataset. But there are some problems:

The model performance may be related to the hyperparameters in the model. Directly adding the new feature may lead to degradation of performance, but the performance may improve through tuning the hyperparameters.
The newly added feature may be conflicted with the existing features in the data matrix, maybe after removing some features in the original data matrix, the new feature will have greatly improved the model performance.

We aim for minimal abstraction over pure TensorFlow, so you can easily assign parts of the computational graph to different hardware, use your own data feeds/queues, and manage your own sessions etc.

Some features:

* Bayesian fully-connected, embedding and convolutional layers using SGVB for inference.
* Random Fourier and arc-cosine features for approximate Gaussian processes (and SVMs).
* Imputation layers with parameters that are learned as part of a model.
* Very flexible construction of networks, e.g. multiple inputs, ResNets etc.
* Compatible and inter-operable with other neural net frameworks such as [Keras](https://keras.io/).

I had implemented the gradient of the softmax layer incorrectly (I was multiplying it by an additional output * (1 - output)), but the odd thing was that I was getting better testing predictions.

So comparing using a gradient on my softmax layer of e^x vs e^x * e^x * (1 - e^x), the latter was actually doing a fair bit better on final testing predictions. Scratching my head I plotted the gradients:

* [correct gradient](http://fooplot.com/#W3sidHlwZSI6MCwiZXEiOiIoZV54KSIsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwMDAwMCJ9LHsidHlwZSI6MTAwMH1d)

* [incorrect gradient](http://fooplot.com/#W3sidHlwZSI6MCwiZXEiOiIoZV54KSplXngqKDEtZV54KSIsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwMDAwMCJ9LHsidHlwZSI6MTAwMH1d)

Which when used basically forces the weights away from classifications that are too accurate, which I imagine does a pretty decent job of preventing overfitting.  The first one *does* train quicker, and *does* reach much lower error rates, however does a worse job of predictions on the test set.

I was wondering if there was any literature on anything like this out there? Can the softmax (or other output layer) be modified to penalize the neural network from being *too* accurate to help improve generalizability and reduce overfitting?",4,6,False,self,,,,,

969,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2017-12-21,2017,12,21,0,7l23y8,self.MachineLearning,[D] Is it me or can OpenAI Baselines be difficult to use?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7l23y8/d_is_it_me_or_can_openai_baselines_be_difficult/,Borgut1337,1513784166,"I should preface this by saying that I think [OpenAI's Baselines repository](https://github.com/openai/baselines/) is a great thing to have in general, I think it's really important to have solid, bug-free implementations ready of all kinds of RL algorithms to use as benchmarks. In particular since [it's been shown](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560) how different implementations of supposedly equivalent algorithms can have wildly different performance. 


I should also mention that I do not yet have a massive amount of experience with tensorflow or other similar frameworks, so it may really just be me who sometimes finds baselines difficult to use. But here's some of the problems I've run into so far. I've primarily been trying to dissect DQN, so that's what I'll focus on.


1. It seems difficult to plug in new network architectures. There are some options for some different architectures in [models.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/models.py), but not a lot. For example, it seems impossible with these functions to use different nonlinearities than relu's. I get that relu's are a good default, but if the intention is that these baselines can be used for research, I'd say there really needs to be support for something as simple as changing the nonlinearities. So, if someone wants a slightly different architecture, they have to write their own code for this. If they're gonna have to do that, it would in my opinion be useful to have some sort of documentation on what such a custom implementation should looke like. Such documentation seems to be lacking, and it doesn't seem to be so trivial to justify having no documentation either. It's not just a case of implementing a tensorflow model, careful inspection of the code reveals that it'd actually have to be a function that can be called at a later point in time to construct that model. It also shouldn't construct the complete model, because some parts of the network are only appended later on in [build_graph.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/build_graph.py).

2. Code for the setup of experiments is mixed in with algorithm-specific code. With the setup of experiments, I mean things like the creation of the environment, logging results, loop through the timesteps, etc. I'd personally expect to find that kind of code in a file such as [train_cartpole.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/experiments/train_cartpole.py). I feel like I'd expect a slightly more object-oriented design, where different RL algorithms (DQN being one of them) having a common interface with functions like act(s) to return an action for the given state s, and update(s, a, r, s'). What we get instead is that every single algorithm seems to have all kinds of experiment-specific details mixed in with the implementation of the algorithm itself. In the case of DQN, parts of the creation of the network, other setup of the algorithm, the entire training loop, and results logging are all mixed in together in a file named [simple.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/simple.py). If I want to compare the performance of DQN to the performance of some other algorithm, how can I be sure that they're evaluated in the same manner? 

3. Why is that file I mentioned in the point above named ""simple.py"" anyway? It seems anything but simple to me.

4. Why is the filename of the file in which a model will be saved after training hardcoded in simple.py? I may want to train and save multiple different DQN models, for instance different models for different environments. I'd like to be able to specify the model filename as parameter.

5. There is a relatively simple example for how to train DQN on Atari environments in [run_atari.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/experiments/run_atari.py). Just like train_cartpole, this one doesn't include any ""experiment setup"" code, just calls into simple.py for that. But there also seems to be a more complicated version in [atari/train.py](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/experiments/atari/train.py). At first glance, this seems to have a **massive** amount of code duplication from simple.py. What are the differences? I don't know, other than that the [DQN documentation](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/deepq) says that the second file has a ""more robust setup for training at scale"". I guess I'll have to compare the files line-by-line if I want to figure out what that means. I didn't do that yet, but I suspect this may be a symptom caused by the fact that algorithm and experiment-specific code are not separated; need to duplicate a lot of code if you want a slightly different experiment setup.

6. There are lots of unresolved issues and pull requests on github. For example, according to [this pull request](https://github.com/openai/baselines/pull/174), there's a bug in the implementation of Prioritized Experience Replay. That pull request has been open for two months now. I get that the authors have no obligation to address any of these, and are probably very busy with other things. However, the original [blog post](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/) about the baselines repository stated that the goal of releasing this was basically to help make sure that researchers can use solid, bug-free implementations of these algorithms. Now I'm not sure, is the person who wrote that pull request correct, is the implementation indeed bugged? I'll have to spend a lot of time figuring that out first, and if it is indeed bugged, I'll also now have to create a fork of the baselines repository and implement the fix in there since I have no idea how long it's going to take till it gets merged into the main repository.


I don't mean to be overly harsh here, I do still think the idea of this repository is great and very important, and I don't know of any better alternatives. I suppose that's exactly why I felt like putting in words exactly what problems I have. I'm just curious if others share my opinion on some of these points, or if I'm just too stupid to make proper use of the repository. ",14,37,False,self,,,,,

However, perhaps this is only for the special cases of chess with boards that are realizable in a 2d euclidean space. We can imagine boards for these games of bounded size that admit no physically realizable analogue on our table. In the case of chess we can imagine there exists first a set S of ordered pair of edges, S = {({e,f},p) | e and f are edges on a square on the chess board, p exists in {0,1}. Edges e and f either run parallel to the line dividing the two sets of pieces or perpendicular. Let the white side of parellel lines and the left side (from the perspective of white) of perpendicular lines be labeled 1  and the black and right sides be labeled 2. If ({e,f}, 0) exists in S, then a piece that crosses edge e from side 1 emerges through edge f at side 2. if p equals 1, then crossing from side 1 causes the piece to emerge on side 1 at the receiving portal. Such a chess board could be physically realized by adding ribbon-like bridges between arbitrary edges on the chess board. A more comprehensive construction could handle bishops and the like, which travel through vertexes instead of edges.

A similar idea is possible in Go. Suppose we take the board and in addition, we specify that points on the grid that are not adjacent have an extra-dimensional adjacency relation. We imagine a set S = {{p,q} such that p and q are points on the Go board} and if {p,q} exists in S, then p and q are considered adjacent for the purpose of counting stones and territory. The dots on the physical Go board are now a 2 projection of a higher dimensional board or point cloud.

**Here's the argument.** I believe that these non-local Chess and Go variants, at least if the size of the sets S are kept small, can be played with proficiency and perhaps mastery by skilled players with minimal learning time. Furthermore, I expect that Deep Blue (or whatever is the state of the art in chess nowadays) or Alpha Go, would have to throw out their training each time to accommodate each possible board variant. The situation looks even more dire for the artificial players if set S is allowed to change over the course of the game.

I suspect the ability to adapt experience in regular Go and Chess to these non-local variants might be the difference between a machine that plays a board game and a being that understands a board game. We could imagine that set S must be found by trial and error, by queuing a chess move and seeing where the piece actually ends up, or in the case of Go if the referee removes stone formations in accordance with the adjacency represented in set S which is latent to the players.

If a machine could play Impossible Go or Chess with Portals, I would be convinced that it is really thinking, or at least really understands the games, in a way qualitatively different than that of the current state of the art for the standard games (which do not seem to think but merely compute). However, I can't really articulate what about these nonlocal games makes them more than just another computational puzzle, besides their hyper-dimensionality and seeming intractability to current methods.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

I made a automated skin disease diagnosis DEMO website based on deep learning algorithm (Model Dermatology; http://ModelDerm.com). ResNet152 and VGG19 were used as a CNN model, around 300,000 images (179 class;176 skin disorders) were used as a trainining dataset. The training images were collected from 4 university hospitals in Korea. This CNN model is the successor to my onychomycosis model (http://nail.medicalphoto.org).

The web-based test platform provides 3 differential diagnosis after analyzing image. Because there are many false positive diagnosis, the diagnosis predicted by the CNN should not be used as a confirmative diagnosis. In addition, the model has a limitation that it cannot recognize normal or unspecific lesion well, and the photograph should be taken in a bright place without shade.

I hope the differential diagnosis predicted by the CNN would help to find the final diagnosis. Thank you.

In ML literature (and other literature, especially academic) the measure/target is 'good reviews from reviewers'.

So which publication hacks are you familiar with, and which annoy you the most?

I'll start, motivated by a comment from https://github.com/hengyuan-hu/bottom-up-attention-vqa :

&gt; The third point is simply because we feel the two stream classifier and pre-training in the original paper is over-complicated and not necessary.

Hack: Begin complex, and do not 'waste' your time with ablation studies / trying to simplify.

Reason this improves the measure/target: Reviewers will more often complain about simplicity ('incremental research') than complexity.

Reason this sucks for everyone involved except the authors: Leads to overly complex models, with little to no understanding of which components are actually useful.

I've noticed loading tensorflow is taking about 1.4 seconds.
(The other imports are super quick)

Tensorflow : '1.4.0'

keras.version: '2.1.2'

I'm running the Inception model V3 with one extra fcc layer with 1024 nodes.

Just loading the model is taking around 12.29 seconds. 


UPDATE:

Using `model = load_model(path, compile=False)` got the time down to

I'm a bit confused by the different products offered by nvidia and had a few questions...

* I've only used AWS for GPUs, so I'm only familiar with the performance of the data center GPUs (K80, V100).  In my experience the V100 runs DL jobs about 3 times as fast as the K80.  I'm curious how nvidia's consumer graphics cards compare with their data center products.  In particular, how will the 1080 Ti and Titan V compare to the K80 and V100, and in general what is the difference between the consumer graphics cards and data center GPUs that merits such a large price discrepancy between the two? 

* The Titan V comes at a much much higher cost than the 1080 Ti.  If I make use of all the DL optimizations in the Volta architecture, **roughly** how many times faster will DL jobs run compared to the 1080 Ti?  In your opinion, is this worth it?

* Are there any emerging technologies or expected product announcements that might make any of the GPUs a risky purchase right now? (perhaps soon to be obsolete or due for a price cut)

Any other advice, recommendations, or personal experience is appreciated.  My use case is pretty standard, and I'm mostly interested in performance as I don't do any memory intensive tasks.",28,8,False,self,,,,,

the tl/dr is that for positive homogeneous convex functions, when the size is large enough, there are no local minimas. 

Has anyone had experience doing this? Does it work? Will this be the new big thing in ML? Btw, this only based on   positive homogeneous convex functions, so using Relu, but not tang/sigmoid

Unlike other GAN, G of this one can directly take samples from the dataset as an input in the sense that they can be used in the tree. There are various kinds of RL problems whose evaluation cannot be easily done by a simple algorithm without using a NN. Realistic text generation (e.g. SeqGAN, LeakGAN) is one example, and this is something I'm particularly interested in. Realistic *** generation is a special subset of the above problems in the sense that infinite supply of labelled (in the sense that they are realistic or not) samples are available. Unrealistic yet close to realistic data can be easily produced by randomly perturbing samples, which are almost certainly unrealistic. Also, we can generate an unrealistic sentence from any node of the tree like this for almost certainty. So, we want to exploit the huge supply of these labelled data. 

1) Let's say, beside the reward assignment by D, we assign terminal reward 1 for each text from the dataset  (and possibly assign terminal reward 0 for perturbed ones), store all of them in the tree and start the usual MCTS-based RL. Is this a beneficial practice? iirc something like this was mentioned in a relevant literature. Since the cost of doing this per text is cheap (though storing all these texts is memory-consuming), we can use a superset of the dataset used in the subsequent training, if that's meaningful. 

2) We want the agent to be just like human rather than to surpass human. So, I think combining the supervised learning approach used in AlphaGo Zero paper, which performed like human-expert, would be helpful, especially because of our numerous data. Maybe use it for pre-training for NN and use 1) for the tree? Any thought? 

3) Even if we use subword-level action, the action counts are at least 4k, whereas there are only ~400 actions for Go. In AlphaZero applied to Go, if we let the action counts to be 4k and keep everything else as they are, how much of memory bottleneck would storing data in the tree be? If I understand correctly, AlphaZero stored in the tree the history of up to 500k of the most recent games. In general, I don't know how much memory tree requires for large action counts, so whatever answer would be helpful.

I made a melanoma diagnosis model named ""Model Melanoma"" based on deep learning algorithm (http://melanoma.modelderm.com).


ResNet152 and VGG19 were used as a CNN model, around 300,000 images (179 classes) were used as a training dataset.


The AUC (area under curve) value of this model is 0.9476 (using melanoma output/nevus output ratio) and 0.9340 (using melanoma output) with all the 407 melanocytic (76 malignant, 331 benign) test images of the Edinburgh dermofit library (https://licensing.edinburgh-innovations.ed.ac.uk/i/software/dermofit-image-library.html).
For reference, the skin cancer detection model published on nature(https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056) showed 0.96 with 225 melanocytic (58 malignant, 167 benign) test images of the Edinburgh dermofit library.


The web-based test platform provides a miss rate or false negative rate (1-sensitivity) in the diagnosis of melanoma. 

In addition, we made 176 skin diseases diagnosis model (http://modelderm.com) and onychomycosis diagnosis model (http://nail.medicalphoto.org). The diagnostic accuracy of the onychomycosis model was better than 42 dermatologists we tested (The manuscripts are under review).

I hope the CNN would help to screening melanoma. Thank you.",20,63,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to practice implementing algorithms but as a beginner this can be insanely hard. And one of the big obstacles I often encounter are likelihood functions. [I've just come across an example again](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4321-an-empirical-evaluation-of-thompson-sampling.pdf). In article 2 they explain that P(theta|D) or rather P(r|a,x,theta)*P(theta) is needed for the algorithm.

But how should I approach this? I mean I have some ideas but they're mostly bad and naive. F.e. is it a good idea here to approx. the reward with the reward of the k nearest neighbours?

as an update equation for mathematical optimization. It was the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of an equation. I thought this method mostly applies for minimization in machine learning as cost is always defined as a positive real valued function. But it was pointed out to me that the update equation of newton-raphson method, which is x = x - y / dy_dx, is unstable at local minimas (where dy_dx = 0) since it makes the update burst to infinity. 

I kept playing with this equation more since it gave me the smoothest curve for what I had been trying to do -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer.ipynb 
and, I was firm on the idea that the update equation must include the cost term (the Einstein's space-time analogy: The dimension of cost is connected with all the parameter dimensions).

Eventually, I landed on this update equation, 
x = x - ((y * dy_dx) / (y + dy_dx^2)); dy_dx = derivative of y wrt. x
link to code -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer%202.0.ipynb
found in last section: ""Equation 2: modified from newton-raphson method"". 

To relate this update equation with the title: 
if we consider the update portion of the equation -&gt;
g(x, y) = (y * x) / (y + x^2) ; y &gt;= 0
It is quite similar to adam since there is a square gradient term in the denominator and the gradient term in the numerator. This equation doesn't use momentum (running averages) and, the learning_rate is replaced by cost (y). 

Now, in Adam, the alpha is initially manually set and is utilised as per the decay equation -&gt; lr_t &lt;- learning_rate * sqrt(1 - beta2^t) / (1 - beta1^t). WIth the equation that I have mentioned, the hypothesis is that this decay is kind of estimating the cost term itself. 

Link to the 3d curve of the g(x, y) function -&gt; https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/?expression=(x*y)%2F(x%2B(y*y))&amp;xRange=0%2C+200&amp;yRange=-100%2C+100&amp;resolution=25

Please let me know what you think about this hypothesis and what it's implications are. I would be thankful and highly grateful if you could point me to some more relevant research so that I can move forward with this.

You want to use a NN but there is one problem: the number of people can be large or small. 
A popular technique to handle a variable  number of inputs is to feed all images (features) one by one to a RNN and aggregate them into states, but that's a hack: the sequential ordering of the images doesn't really matter.

One solution I came up with is to feed the stack of images to a regular NN (to extract features like maybe happy faces?, gender?, age? ) and then aggreagete the outputs (for each image) into a fixed size state, and then go from there. Aggregation can be eg taking the mean, use desity estimating, or radial basis functions. The aggregation collapses the variable batch size into a fixed size.

Is there a name for this technique where you handle unordered variable number of inputs via aggregating extracted features across a batch? Do you know of papers where this is being used? Are there other methods other than RNN?",5,3,False,self,,,,,

A good interpretation is that these are customers and I want to find the most valuable ones.

One idea is decision trees, but I'm not sure this yields the optimal groups for my problem. My intuition is that decision trees mainly are used for prediction, so the focus of the algorithms might be different. Another idea is a brute force search.

In a nutshell the rule says if there is no pre-synaptic spike then there will be no weight change (to preserve connections that were not responsible). Otherwise the direction of weight change will depend on whether a post-synaptic spike occured and whether there was a reward.

I have not been able to find much existing work re: local rules for deep models, however it's quite likely this rule exists elsewhere..

- Does this rule (or similiar) already exist ? Does it fall under an existing framework (eg Williams REINFORCE)?
- What are the likely shortcomings/limitations (eg scaling issues) ?

In the paper, Image-to-Image translation with conditional adversarial networks (P.Isola et al., CVPR, 2016), the loss function for their network shows that Generator should have two inputs as it G(x,z) has two parameters.

Optimizing a confusion loss to remove bias.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7mohi3/d_learning_to_forget_optimizing_a_confusion_loss/,brannondorsey,1514486720,"A few months ago I stumbled onto an interesting idea while listening to the [TWiML &amp; AI podcast](https://twimlai.com/). It described a process by which one could attempt to introduce confusion into a network (starting at any arbitrary hidden layer) so that it couldn't learn from select biases in the training data. For example, if you were training an image classification network, and you wanted to forbid the network to learn anything about race, you could use this technique, to do so. The problem is that I can't for the life of me remember what this technique is called, or what episode of the podcast it was discussed in. 

All that I remember is that I believe that the method proposed involved choosing a layer beyond which you didn't want the network to be able to include information about the bias you were trying to remove (the layer becomes a filter of sorts), and using that layer as input to a second neural network that was optimizing a confusion loss. Provided you had labels about race, the second, auxiliary network would maximize (yes, maximize) its loss in a classification task identifying race (the characteristic you wan't the main network to forget). Therefore, the second network would learn parameters that actually don't know how to distinguish between races in images. Training a bias-removal/confusion auxiliary network in this way would cause the parameters of the filter layer to be updated such that the main network wouldn't be able to use its activation's to learn the biases you are trying to remove in downstream layers to solve the original image classification task. 

Does anyone have a clue what this method is called, or have interesting/helpful links to where I could learn more about it? Thanks!",5,0,False,self,,,,,

The thought would be, humans can improve at games like chess without being told explicitly what good moves are. Someone can play lots of games and start to lable certain ideas as good or bad. Maybe they notice that having center control leads to more wins, and moving the same price many times leads to losses.  With this in mind I am wondering if this type of idea has implemented before, learning off of only wins and losses.
