So I have a simple question -  I have written a simple SOM code, using two-dimensional data to play around with. 

As I understand it:

1) The data used in SOMs must be normalized, to have unit length. 

2) A weight vector that a SOM uses during the update is normalized to unit length every iteration as well, so that the weight vector doesnt 'blow up'.

This is confusing to me however. If you look [here](http://imgur.com/bN7TA), this is my 2-dimensional original data that I would like to train a SOM to. (It is un-normalized). I can clearly make out 3 clusters. 

If I normalize it however, that means I am projecting it unto the unit circle as shown [here](http://imgur.com/NoFGl). However if I do that... I lose the information about those 3 clusters from the above image...

I need one point clarified for me regarding gibbs sampling on a dirichlet process--

I am pretty much up-to-speed on the generative portion of the algorithm:

for each datapoint to be generated:
*Draw a partition, c_i, from a Chinese Restaurant Process, ployna urn, or STICK()...

*look up the parameter vector, phi_i, associated with c_i

*If there is currently no existing phi(c_i), draw one from the base measure Phi, and associate it with subsequent c_i

 *generate datapoint based on F(phi_i )


For gibbs sampling, we remove one datapoint at random from his table and sample a new table from the CRP...
If he was the only datapoint at his old table, we can forget the index-&gt;parameter mapping previously associated with that table.
We calculate the posterior: p(x|y,z) which is a lot like saying, p(x|y, Phi_z).

What special sauce is my intuition missing here? it is not obvious to me how this will optimize the number of tables/clusters.

We have a set of about 30 ""problems"", which we will get a binary correct/incorrect outcome from when an individual goes through the problem set. We also have data now for about 300 individuals going through this set.

The end result is we want a weighting for each of these problems, based on its difficulty, so that we can decide which did best. In earlier versions we have simply manually assigned a point value, and tallied up the points, but we are concerned about mis-valuing problems, since we have in the past. These problems have a large range of difficulty, the easiest of which nearly everyone got correct, while some of the most difficult on had a single solve (by different individuals).

One of the proposed solutions is just to assign a point value for all problems, then simply decrease the point value by some scheme based on the number of correct solves. While that would certainly work and be fairly accurate, it seems like there should be a more elegant solution than that.

Hey all, 

So I have been studying up on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, (EM), but I also know of Gaussian Mixture Models, (GMMs), that are used to describe data that is a Mixture of Gaussians. (MoG). 

Some of what I will say here might be inaccurate, so please correct me, but my question is basically, what is the difference, if any, on the way the EM Algorithm works, VS the maximum likelihood algorithm in GMMs?

I know that in EM, we are first computing the latent variables, (probability weights if we are clustering), and then we compute the new mu's and the new covariance matrix. We then repeat with the computation of the updated latent variables, etc etc. 

So I get that, but in GMMs, arent we also kinda doing the same thing? How does this differ from how we would compute the parameters of a GMM for specific data?

If there is a difference between computation of parameters of GMM and how EM-algorithm works, what is it? Are they the same thing?

I was wondering if you folks might have any suggestions on a pet project that I've been thinking about. Also, if I'm barking up the wrong subreddit, please inform me.

Anyways, I have my hands on data for thousands of households' energy usage for discrete fifteen minute time intervals over ~1+ years of time. I also have data like 'how many sq ft is the house' and 'what was the weather on whichever day' and some other interesting things.

I was wondering if there might be some cool methods to implement in order to try to predict future energy usage amounts on a household basis. Something where I could say ""This household's energy usage for the past xxxx 15 minute blocks of time looks like this. I predict that in the next 15 minutes they will use y kWh.""

I don't know too much about ML, but stuff like Markov Chains pop into my mind because I have discrete events. Unfortunately, my values for the events aren't very discrete and furthermore they are ordinal. I've never seen a MC that deals with this kind of data (then again, I have a really, really naive sense of MCs).

I have a question about using decision trees for multiclass classification. 

I'm familiar with the concept of a ""One-vs-all"" approach where for N classes you would learn N models, where the *i*th model represents if an instance is classified as the *i*th class or not. This may seem silly, but my question is what do you do after you've trained those models and want to classify a new instance? What if more than one of your models say that this instance belongs in the *i*th class?

As a user, you currently have one upvote/downvote. This is obviously problematic, because not everybody views the same thing as good. You would have to somehow categorize what you like in different areas, so multidimensional upvotes? Sounds like a bad idea.    
But you don't have to present this to the user. So, keep the current upvote/downvote arrows, but instead of directly adding them up, give posts an n-dimensional vector as rating. The user will recieve one as well, bound to his account and describing what he likes. The system can then compare the two vectors, a high similarity should indicate content the user wants to see, this will give it a high rating for this user. This could be done by projecting the vector of the post onto that of the user and then determine its length. The higher the value, the better.    
How are these vectors generated? When a user votes on a post, his voting vector gets imprinted into the post vector, in the simplest case by just adding them up. At the same time, the post vector gets imprinted onto the user vector, for example by norming the length of the post vector to one and then taking the weighted average. To help set things up, a small random offset should be added to he user vector before adding it into an upvote.    
This approach has of course some implementation problems, namely the by far increased computational costs (I don't know how much they take for the current reddit system).

I wanted to try the hypothesis that the binary/categorical features are enough to predict the numeric phenotypes (for instance, lifespan of the organism), but after some exploratory data analysis with Weka I could not get anything clear.

Most of the binary or categorical features are mutations in some genomic regions, but in many cases (&gt;90%), the value is equal to 0 (no mutation). Besides, most of this mutations are known not to produce a particular effect (i.e. they are irrelevant wrt the phenotype).

I have tried linear regression and lasso (the one implemented in Matlab) with no much success. I have tried to discretize the attribute into 3/4 classes, and tried several classifiers which finally gave really bad values.

Should I try an specific technique apart from the classical ones? Do you recommend me certain preprocessing techniques?
