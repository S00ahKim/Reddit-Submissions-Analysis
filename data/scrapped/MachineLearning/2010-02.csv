And of course there is noise in the dataset. I'm thinking of using a semi-supervised learning technique for my case. Because i have a lot of unlabeled samples. But semi-supervised techniques, usually tend to have higher computational cost when compared to other techniques. But cluster and label or cotraining approaches are still in my mind. I have tested SVM(C-SVC in libsvm) on my dataset and got 91% percent accuracy rate but lasted about 13 min. Also tested C4.5 and got 85 percent accuracy rate but it finished under 5 min. Both algorithms are tested with default parameters without fine-tuning. C4.5 is quick and it can get better accuracy by using boosting. But i don't want to use C4.5 for personal reasons :). Bayesian techniques that i have tested are also too slow and have long training time. What is you opinion? 

Edit: I have also written KNN but it took longer than 10 mins and it was the least accurate one.
Edit 2: I meant 7 tuples=7 features.",24,15,False,self,,,,,
