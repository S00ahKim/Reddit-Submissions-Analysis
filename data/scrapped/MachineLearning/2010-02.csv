I looked at the modeling and simulation of the cooking process but it was only focused on certain areas of cooking. Would it be possible to use the methods of preparation from a database of given recipes in order to determine the best sequence of actions given a target value? I would appreciate any insight and advice.",11,8

And of course there is noise in the dataset. I'm thinking of using a semi-supervised learning technique for my case. Because i have a lot of unlabeled samples. But semi-supervised techniques, usually tend to have higher computational cost when compared to other techniques. But cluster and label or cotraining approaches are still in my mind. I have tested SVM(C-SVC in libsvm) on my dataset and got 91% percent accuracy rate but lasted about 13 min. Also tested C4.5 and got 85 percent accuracy rate but it finished under 5 min. Both algorithms are tested with default parameters without fine-tuning. C4.5 is quick and it can get better accuracy by using boosting. But i don't want to use C4.5 for personal reasons :). Bayesian techniques that i have tested are also too slow and have long training time. What is you opinion? 

Edit: I have also written KNN but it took longer than 10 mins and it was the least accurate one.
Edit 2: I meant 7 tuples=7 features.",24,15

I have a degree in statistics but am very interested in learning more about machine learning and how it can be applied to prediction, forecasting and market segmentation problems.

Can anyone recommend machine learning executive education programs, conferences or workshops? 

Geographic location is not an issue.
