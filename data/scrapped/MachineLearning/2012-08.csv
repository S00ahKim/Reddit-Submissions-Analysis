it is certain that the obj in adaboost is minimizing exp loss, and therefore maximizing unnormalized margin. However, Schapire (in his book or video) mentioned normalized margin(between [-1,1]) is also maximized. 
I test adaboost (with some UCI dataset, like twonorms, etc) and in my plot of expected normalized margin Vs # of weak learners, the curve is **decreasing**, the final histogram of normalized margin is centered at 0.2~0.3 like a normal distribution,  not as the case all the margin goes to 1.

In philosophy, I try to understand it in this way, let's say in the 1st iteration, the normalized margin is either 1 or -1, then normalized margin is maximized/minimized  for correct/incorrect labeled pts,  the histogram has two extremes. As long as you keen on training, more weak learners come in, so they are giving you correct labels and wrong labels, increase or reduce the normalized margin a little bit, the hist of margins seems to be smoothed. 
In extreme, if you run the algo long enough, weak learners' err rate are very close to 0.5. for a particular data point , perhaps 55% of weak learners give your correct label, 45% give you incorrect labels. when you normalized alpha with l1 norm, the margin is a little bigger than zero. alpha may be larger for the beginning weak learners, but as you have many weak learners,, its relative weight become small, its effect is ignorable.   Is there anything wrong with this argument?

however, the unnormalized margin did increase, that's for sure.

I understand that choosing the subsets, constructing the trees, etc. involves a lot of details I am glossing over, but I am just trying to get to the point.

My question is, what about doing a nearest neighbor search? The voting scheme does not seem to make sense in the nearest neighbor context. Do you simply select the randomized subsets of features and then rank each data point by its averaged position across all subsets?

I'm a little confused and I'm hoping you can help me out. Suppose you have a non-convex differentiable function that only contains one minimum. Gradient descent should find this one minimum (global minimum) even though the function is non-convex, correct?

Assuming the above is correct, then the only way gradient descent would fail is if the differentiable function had more than one minimum (local minima). Looking at http://holehouse.org/mlclass/06_Logistic_Regression.html
at the ""Cost function for logistic regression"" section, he goes over an intuitive default cost function, then explains that it won't work due to non-convexity/localminima. I've plotted the function here:
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%281%2F%281%2Be%5E-x%29%29%5E2+
and it doesn't appear to have multiple minima. The entire cost function J(theta) is a sum of multiple instances of these, so I played around with summing the function with different y values like this:
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%281%2F%281%2Be%5E-x%29%29%5E2+%2B+%281%2F%281%2Be%5E-x%29+-+1%29%5E2++
but there are still no local minima (only one minimum). It seems as though gradient descent should be guaranteed to work. I know I must be missing something or misunderstanding something, but I can't figure out what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

For those unfamiliar with the equations or filters mentioned, let me explain:
  
The Fokker Planck Kolmogorov equation (FPKE) and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (CKE) are both equations which are used to propagate processes with probabilistic initial conditions or processes with random forcing/terms in the dynamics.
   
These are idea/concepts often encountered in statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics, if you're a physics major, or estimation/stochastic processes, if you're a math or engineering major, although curriculum variability could lead to different paths. 
  
The linear filters I'm referring to are the two commonly used forms of the Kalman filter, the Unscented Kalman filter, and the Extended Kalman filter. These filters are used to propagate probabilistic processes as Gaussian distributions (they only take into account the first two moments).
  
Since the FKPE and CKE are very general probabilistic propagation equations, it seems reasonable that the simpler approximations, the EKF and the UKF, should stem from these equations. My questions is, does any one know of a source that details these derivations?",6,11,False,self,,,,,

Context: I'm a 2nd year PhD student in ML. In my first year, I decided that academia isn't for me, and that I'd like to go into industry after my PhD. Recently, I've seen that if one's intentions are to go into industry, then the MS is the superior degree. But I have also seen that a lot of machine learning jobs require PhDs.

To be honest, I'm leaning towards bailing with a masters, because I can always come back for the PhD if I dislike my options in industry. Before I bring this up with my advisor, though, I'd like to know what sort of jobs I can expect to get. If it changes anything, I have two bachelors degrees (applied math and physics) that aren't in CS.

Unfortunately, the best answer I'd been given was to use Google's advanced search operators like 'inurl'.

I was able to find a better solution by using the Google Custom Search technology. I made a custom search engine with *.edu, *.ac.uk, *.edu.au and so on sites and domain zones, 145 in a total at this moment.
From my point of view that search engine gives much better result pages, than an ordinary search. Also, the search index is almost spam-free and paid content -free.

There is a feature, that allows one to inspect what sites are included in the index, to comment them and to vote for or against them (to purge unrelevant site from the index, for example). Also, everyone is welcome to suggest new sites using a special form on the site.
In short, it has all very basic machinery needed to make such scoped search engine to be community driven.

Average those clips together. This is the reconstruction.

It looks like this last entry is the one that broke the camel's back (which led to the shadowbanned) but you cannot be learning about ML now without understanding where this is going and what type of skills you need (which this entry addresses).

In short, what is appropriate posting about Machine Learning ?

I spend most of my free time writing software or doing math.

I have recently been going through the Coursera Machine Learning course and have found the subject to be really awesome. I have found a few nice data sets that I have been playing around with, and have started diving into a textbook (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop). It is going to take me a long time to get through it, though.

In the meantime, does anyone have any ideas for projects that could use novice-level skills in machine learning but also have a large software development component? It seems like there is only a small portion of ""data scientists"" that have significant software development experiences, so I am hoping that there is some interesting low-hanging fruit here.",29,30,False,self,,,,,

1) A lot of people seem to think that if an AI were able to become more intelligent than humans, that would necessarily imply that the AI would form emotions like jealousy, rage, concerns about its survival, and other biological instincts as a by-product of its intelligence.

I disagree, and I think that the AI could be very smart at doing many tasks, but that doesn't mean that it would form emotions and concerns about its survival, which are inherently biological in nature, unless it was programmed to feel such emotions. It could self-destruct itself as a means to achieving its goals without blinking if it decides its the correct course of action.

Which idea is the correct one?

2) In traditional programming, you can put in a check such as:

     if (Security.checkAgainstRules( action) )
            doAction(action);
     else
           doNothing();

In the AI's decision making module, as a way to safeguard that any actions it takes wouldn't violate any of the rules that are set in it, such as not to harm any humans, etc. Some people say that if an AI is programmed using neural networks, such safeguards won't work, which is weird to me. Surely there must be some code governing which actions to take even for the neural networks? Or there must be some way to put in safeguards even in a neural network?",4,0,False,self,,,,,
