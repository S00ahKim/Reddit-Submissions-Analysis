Ideally, I'm looking for a way to do this with Python, even if it requires me to write a C extension. Anyone mind pointing me in the right direction? Even just theory, or general concepts on learning and guessing patterns is totally acceptable.

EDIT: Came up with a better way to describe what I'm looking do to: number forecasting. If I feed it just a random series of numbers (like 54, 8, 2, 7, 3, 3 ,7, 8, 34, 87, 3, 8, 41, 8 or whatever, with no range limits), it should report its guess, then learn from the next number I give it, which I'll predetermine before I start feeding numbers. Put simply: it should be able to give me a forecast of tomorrow's average temperature, based on, say, a few month's (or year's) worth of data.",19,3,False,self,,,,,

Edit:
Basically do you have a fair amount of time and have decent skills?  Send me a message lets get a group of people together skype it up, discuss ideas, go with a project we like and crank out something awesome in 3 weeks.  My skillset is mech eng, machine learning algorithms, and data mining/collecting, preferred language python, matlab.
