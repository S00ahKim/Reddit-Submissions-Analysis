There's KL-divergence, JS divergence, Earth mover distance etc.

KL divergence seems to be widespread in ML but I still don't feel like I could explain to my grandma what it is. So here is what I don't get:

* What's the geometric interpretation of KL divergence? For example, the EMD distance suggests ""chuck of earth times the distance it was moved"" for all the chunks. That's kind of neat. But for KL, I fail to understand what all the logarithms mean and how could I intuitively interpret them.

* What's the reasoning behind using a function which is not symmetric? 
In what scenario would I want a loss which is differerent depending if I'm transforming distribution A to B vs B to A?

* Wasserstein metric (EMD) seems to be defined as the minimum cost of turning one distribution into the other. Does it mean that KL divergence is not the minimum cost of transforming the piles? Are there any connections between those two divergences?

* Is there a geometric interpretation for generalizations of KL divergence, like f-divergence or various other statistical distances? This is kind of a broad question, but perhaps there's an elegant way to understand them all.

When the behavior policy is different from the target policy, we usually need to use some kind of importance sampling. In semi-gradient methods, we want to minimize

    L(w) = 1/2 sum_t (G_t - v(S_t|w))^2

where w represents the parameters of the approximating function (e.g. an ANN), v is the value function and G_t is the return (i.e. expected total reward) which depends on whether we use MC, TD, etc... In *semi*-gradient methods we ignore the dependence of G_t on w.

The gradient of L wrt w is simply

    gL(w) = - sum_t (G_t - v(S_t|w)) gv(S_t|w)
          = - sum_t delta gv(S_t|w)

where

    delta = G_t - v(S_t|w)

In stochastic GD we update w as follows:

    w &lt;- w + alpha delta gv(S_t|w)

where alpha is the *learning rate*.

The off-policy correction rho should be applied to G_t:

    gL_{off}(w) = - sum_t (rho G_t - v(S_t|w)) gv(S_t|w)

According to the book (page 270 (290), subsection 11.1), the update becomes

    w &lt;- w + alpha rho delta gv(S_t|w)

That is, rho multiplies both G_t and v(S_t|w). **Why is that?**",4,13,False,self,,,,,

Base dataset:  
~300 images that show ""before"" and ""after"" images of a photo converted to anime style (already acquired).  
Note: Before running the NN I plan to augment the data by slightly modifying the input photos in different subtle ways.  This should boost the quantity of input images by a factor of 10.

NN Stack:  

Input layer (photo)  
Convnet (some combination of Conv, Relu, and/or Pool layers) to pull features from the photos  
Fully-connected layer to convert from photo features to anime features  
Deconvnet (reversal of the previous convnet) to convert anime features to anime images

For over 12k products in 800k orders we have trained individual classifiers for each product (based on xgboost trees) that produce rank in range &lt;0;1&gt; (the higher the rank, the better). 

The data has obviously large class imbalance, top 500 products constitue 50% of all ordered products. (top 100 = 25%, top 500=50%, top 2000=75%)

The classifier ranks are concatenated together, and by thresholding over 12k outputs we get the products that should be recommended. 

The metric that we use is that we want to maximize recall for specified precision=0.5. In the ideal result where recall would be 1, the user would have to only throw away half of the recommended products (dropping products from shopping list is easier than finding them, that's why we have this metric). This metric is calculated as the mean of precision and recall for individual orders.

Individual classifiers have high performance:

`train-logloss:0.011609  train-auc:0.981035`

`test_0-logloss:0.020463 test_0-auc:0.900525`

`test_1-logloss:0.014504 test_1-auc:0.956798`

`valid-logloss:0.014478   valid-auc:0.966512`


(where dataset has been splitted based on how last the order was (k), test_0 is the latest dataset (k == 0), test_1 is the before-latest (k==1), valid is (k==2) and train is (k &gt;= 3).

The performance understandably drops when all of the predictions are used together (the best we got so far is P,R=(0.5, 0.5)). It drops however too much - we use the same threshold for all the products, so we thought we could use individual thresholds, one per product.

The thresholds now should be *set for each product, but the metric is calculated per orders*. (Optimizing the threshold per product doesn't help, it yields very poor results)

Speed is another issue - we're dealing with matrices of size 800k x 12k

I think this is fundamentally a hard combinatoric problem - if the thresholds would be `len(np.arange(0, 100, 0.01)) == 100`, then by grid searching it would be searching through 100^12000 combinations :-) 

We used greedy search where one threshold is optimized at a time and the other thresholds have been fixated to the previously calculated global one. That helped, but it doesn't generalize from the training set.

Another option we thought we could use is to formulate this problem as LP - linearize the precision, recall curves for each product, but so far I wasn't successful in doing the formalization (I'm not sure if it's even possible).

I would've expected this is a problem that is well solved, but I couldn't find anything reasonable in the sea of irrelevant search results. If you know about some literature, please submit a link to it. 

Thank you very much!

Assume my ultimate goal after graduating is to become a Research Scientist at one of the good ML/AI labs [ I've noticed its almost impossible without a PhD but no harm in trying, right? :) ]

How should I go about choosing subjects? 
Which topics are important to set up a good foundation for being able to do research?
Any topics that are currently hot and would help getting a job? (Eg : Deep Learning)
What systems courses should I take? (Eg : Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing etc)

Here is my current list (based on compulsory requirements, my opinions and those of some of my senior co-workers) :

1. A PhD level intro to machine learning course 
2. An Intro to Deep Learning course (from Ruslan Salakhutdinov) [link] (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/10807_2016/)
3. Probabilistic Graphical Models (Eric Xing) [link](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708/)
4. A course on multi-modal learning
5. Parallel Computer Architecture And Programming [link] (http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/)

What are your thoughts on taking up some *deeper* courses like: 

1. Statistical Machine Learning
2. Intermediate Statistics (by Larry Wasserman) [link](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/)
3. Something on real analysis/measure and integration


Should I also focus on some applied ML type courses like Sequence to Sequence Modelling, Deep Reinforcement Learning for Control etc?

Any CMU specific courses/professors that you would recommend?

I spent the last few years doing web app development. Dug into DL a couple months ago. Supposedly, compared to the post-post-post-docs doing AI stuff, JavaScript developers should be inbred peasants. But every project these peasants release, even a fucking library that colorizes CLI output, has a catchy name, extensive docs, shitloads of comments, fuckton of tests, semantic versioning, changelog, and, oh my god, better variable names than `ctx_h` or `lang_hs` or `fuck_you_for_trying_to_understand`.

The concepts and ideas behind DL, GANs, LSTMs, CNNs, whatever  it's clear, it's simple, it's intuitive. The slog is to go through the jargon (that keeps changing beneath your feet - what's the point of using fancy words if you can't keep them consistent?), the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention.

Sorry for singling out, but [look at this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator/blob/master/src/agent.py) - what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up.

- Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudo-code a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations?

- How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code?

- Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code?

- When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms?

- Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a ""baseline"" TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession?

Actually this effect also happens when I start the model from a pre-trained state.

1) Relu input became negative so the backprop will not get gradients anymore (Could Leaky relu solve that?)

He even says: 'The fact that it works so well is extremely unfortunate because it makes it really hard to get rid of!'.

Further, the CS231n notes too make the following argument : 'Getting rid of pooling. Many people dislike the pooling operation and think that we can get away without it. For example, Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net proposes to discard the pooling layer in favor of architecture that only consists of repeated CONV layers. To reduce the size of the representation they suggest using larger stride in CONV layer once in a while. Discarding pooling layers has also been found to be important in training good generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs). It seems likely that future architectures will feature very few to no pooling layers'.

Personally, when it comes to convnets (much like Uber), I used to pool. Post RELU especially, I had visualized the histogram of features being max-pooled, and they had indeed looked reasonable flat to me. Connection: Maximum() is a sufficient statistic for Uniform[0,\theta] - Exponential family 101. Make  sense. Hand-wavy. But still ..
And now (just like with Uber), I have ditched it in favor of something better (dilated convolution /Lyft).

One of yesterday's papers on ArXiV claiming state-of-the-art results in Medical Image Segmentation, titled, 'DeepIGeoS: A Deep Interactive Geodesic Framework for Medical Image Segmentation' state : 'Therefore, to preserve resolution through the network, we remove the max-pooling and downsampling layers and use dilated convolution in each block'.
So, the question is: Can we pronounce max-pooling dead for conv-nets?

The idea is about transforming images a la smile vector or faceapp. The way such apps works, as far as I know, is that they train a network to embed images (or maybe parts of images?) as vectors, and then work out what transformations of the vectors correspond to the desired transformation of the images.

But if the end goal is to transform images, wouldn't it be possible to target that directly instead? Say you train an encoder on pairs of images, A and B. Instead of trying to learn a representation for the full images, it learns a vector V representing the work needed to transform one image to the other.

So to keep this short here is what I've done so far:

* Trained a Doc2Vec model with 8.5 million post titles (at 100, and 200 dimensions)

* Pulled mod actions from reddit as training data. I grab the post title (cleaned using nltk) and [1,0] == remove post and [0,1] == approve post

* Created Doc2Vec vectors of all of the post titles in the training data

* Ran tf-idf on the training data titles

* I then concatenate the tf-idf 100 best features and Doc2Vec vec together to produce one large feature matrix

* Then I scaled all of the features using sklearn featurescaler 

* Feed all of this into a multilayer perceptron with dropout built with tensorflow

This achieves an accuracy of about 78% or so, which seemed alright until I realised that is literally just the distribution of my training data that is about 78% remove and 22% approve. I hacked an example of a Text CNN I found online to work on my data which achivies an accuracy of about 82% at best, which means it's only 4% better than guessing randomly according to the probability distribution of the training data. 

So now comes my question. How do I improve this guy's accuracy? Is there another method I should try, or features I should add to the existing one, or modifications I should make? Sorry if this is too noob for this subreddit, but I'm in a bit over my head I think",6,1,False,self,,,,,

Would you like to co-author a paper with Dr. Eamonn Keoghs Lab? The paper, to be submitted to the Data Mining Journal [a] in late Summer or early Fall, is likely to be one of the top ten most cited paper in the journal [b]. Obviously, we cannot guarantee that paper will be accepted, but with 20 papers in the journal, Dr. Keogh is currently the most prolific author in the Data Mining Journal, and will submit a very strong paper.

In brief, the proposed paper claims that, given a data structure called the Matrix Profile, you can often add just 5 to 10 lines of code, to solve an interesting problem. Thus far there are 3 concrete examples:

1) With the Matrix Profile and 6 lines of code, you can solve the Discovering Motifs Under Uniform Scaling problem.

2) With the Matrix Profile and 2 lines of code, you can solve the Discovering Time Series Semordnilaps problem.

3) With the Matrix Profile and 2 lines of code, you can solve the Discovering Time Series Reverse Complements problem.

4) &lt;your idea here&gt;


We plan to find about seven more such ideas. If you contribute an idea (and ideally, with a dataset and a little writing / motivation) we will add you as a co-author.

What do you have to do? 

1) Read the main Matrix Profile paper [c]. Note that you dont need to understand HOW the Matrix Profile is computed, only what the Matrix Profile IS.

2) (optional) Read some of the other Matrix Profile papers, play with the GUI for the Matrix Profile [d].

3) Skim the (rough draft of) the Matrix Profile tutorial [e].

4) Read the rough draft of the paper in question The Swiss Army Knife of Time Series Data Mining [f].

5) Come up with an idea, the shorter and simpler the better! Send your idea to eamonn@cs.ucr.edu



Best wishes, The MP team
----

Basic Rules 

1) If two people give us the exact same idea, we will pick the first person (and show the later person the email time stamps as proof). However, if the two people have related ideas that we can join together somehow, we will try to combine them and offer both co-authorship.

2) Any ideas you submit are 100% yours, you can publish your own spin-off papers, start a company with them etc. However, anything you submit is going to be seen by at least a dozen individuals, dont submit anything you want to patent or to be keep top-secret for some reason.


[a] https://link.springer.com/journal/10618 

[b] This is a strong claim, but according to the editor, Keogh has two of the top ten most cited papers from this decade, and two of the top ten most cited papers from the last decade. This paper will also be highly cited.

315,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2017-7-9,2017,7,9,5,6m38t2,self.MachineLearning,[P] Attempted implementation of Solomonoff induction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6m38t2/p_attempted_implementation_of_solomonoff_induction/,thai_tong,1499545520,"Solomonoff induction and its use of the Kolmogorov complexity has fascinated me, to me it's way to overcoming overfitting which happens when we apply more and more complex models to explain the data. I wanted to use it as a way to objectively determine when to switch from a simple model to a more complicated one.

An actual implementation of Solomonoff induction is computationally prohibitive. I wanted to try out a reduced version of the induction to see how well it would work. I'm not claiming that I actually implemented Solomonoff's theory, this is an attempt at a practical approximation of it.

**Models**

Rather than considering every possible model which can be written in code I consider a few models, they were:

- Constant y=a

- Inverse y=a/x

- Linear y=ax+b

- Quadratic y=ax^2 +bx+c

- Power law y=a*e^bx

**Introducing non-determinism**

The first challenge is that Solomonoff's approach is purely deterministic, the coded models produce a string output and if the string output doesn't exactly match the target output then the model is considered wrong. To introduce the statistical noise I limit the noise term to having a normal distribution with 0 mean. I use Jeffrey's prior for the variance of the noise term, this leads to a likelihood estimate which is inversely proportional to the root-mean-squared error (Very convenient). Since all models have the same noise term the additional complexity in the model which describes the noise has no effect on the posterior probabilities.

**Using model MLE**

Solomonoff's approach would consider all possible values of the parameters and would calculate the kolmogorov complexity of each case. This requires too much computation so I considered only the complexity of the model with the parameters left as variables in the code. In this way when calculating the priors I consider the prior probability of the family of models; there is no prior over the parameters, only a prior probability for the type of model. The posterior probability is calculated using the MLE parameters. I believe this creates a bias in favour of more complex models.

**Model program length**

To trial this idea I wrote functions for each model in as few characters as possible. Where L is the length of the function the prior probability is 2^(-L). It's best to use a low-level programming language, a high level language favours complex models. I wrote the functions in Python but restricted its functionality to add/subtract/multiply/divide functions in order to simulate a low-level language. I admit this is a very limited approach but it's convenient for testing out the idea.

The prior probabilities are as follows:

- Constant 0.998

- Inverse 1.9E-3

- Linear 1.2E-4

- Quadratic 4.8E-7

- Power law 1.8E-40 (coding the exponential function takes a LOT of characters)

**Test design &amp; Results**

I simulated data from the function y={1-2x if x&lt;=0.5, 0 if x&gt;0.5. x was restricted to the range [0,1]. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/AjOHy) is an image of 100 data points produced.

The results were disappointing, the ranking of model likelihoods did not change after applying a Bayesian update. The posterior probability of the constant model dropped to 99.9% of its prior value, the inverse model's probability remained about the same and the remaining models; probability approximately doubled.

The priors are highly sensitive to how the models are encoded- a single extra character halves the prior probability of a model. This really limits how well approximations and simplifications can work.

**TL;DR**

I attempted a bastardized version of Solomonoff induction and it didn't work. I'd like to hear your suggestions on how to use a less restrictive simplification.",11,19,False,self,,,,,

Question 1:

Proof of proposition 1. Why do the authors completely disregard the integral sign and go on to minimizing the function under the integral sign? I verified their proof, I just don't understand what allows them to disregard the integral?

Question 2:

From where did the KL appear in Theorem 1? I guess I realize how they get the -log(4), but why are they later subtracting those 2 KLs?

I feel like in both cases the authors took some leaps of faith which are understandable for experts in the field, whereas I am not one and I seek your help or guidance to materials thoroughly explaining my two questions.",12,13,False,self,,,,,

I'm taking some data science certificates through coursera and I really like machine learning so far. 

I found an interesting situation today. 

I used a GAM model to ensemble a GLM (better predictor at higher values) and RF (better predictor at lower values) model. It worked great on my test set, but performed slightly worse than GLM on the validation set. 

I've read the wikipedia and searched online - I found information about WHY ensembling works to make better predictions, but I can't figure out how it could be a worse predictor than its component models. 

Here's a specific reproducible example. But any answers about the theory itself would be really helpful too.

I'm currently working on a project for a class (AI for Robotics) and my final project pretty much narrows down to predicting where a robot will be located in the future. I get data in (x,y) coordinates of a robot's location gathered from a video where the robot is inside a box. It just wonders around and once it hits an obstacle (e.g. wall), it changes direction. The training data comes from a video that lasts 60 seconds, at 30fps, and i'm supposed to output a prediction of the next 2 seconds (60 frames/points). Seems pretty simple but I was wondering if I could get some ideas on what algorithms or approaches would best suit this problem. Any input is highly appreciated.  
That being said, here is what I was thinking. At first, I thought about particle filters, but this filter requires constant measurement and is more suited to localize a target based on measurements, which I won't have, so I don't think that's a good approach at all.  
My second thought was to parametrize a PID controller and build a Q-Learner that learns the right parameters for the controller to fit the data.   ",2,5,False,self,,,,,

The G quadruplex form of DNA forms a channel capable of holding an array of different cations (complexed to the carbonyl oxygens). I and a coauthor delve into it at length in [2]. I have proposed that long repeats of G's in junk DNA could form nanowires in the nucleus (porphyrins are suggestively shaped to be possible gates), and that sequences of different ions traveling through the core could additionally encode information. Up until now I didn't have an idea of what purpose that could serve, but this could be it.

A final hand-wave in our paper is that molecular mechanical methods didn't explain ion selectivity, and that plus the resemblance of the twisted oxygen-ion stack to organic superconductors led us to suggest a quantum effect.

Any shortcuts for undecimated wavelet transform?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6moub2/discussion_compressive_sensing_with_l0/,FrigoCoder,1499803738,"Sorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit for the topic.

L0 minimization is the holy grail of [compressive sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing), or more specifically [sparse approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_approximation). Unfortunately it is an NP-hard combinatorial problem so exact solution is not possible. Common approximations include L1 minimization and greedy algorithms.

[Undecimated wavelet transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_wavelet_transform) is basically just a discrete wavelet transform with the downsampling and upsampling steps removed, and the filters upsampled to account for this. It is translation invariant, it avoids ringing artifacts, however it is highly redundant, and inversion is icky. For one dimension, the transformation matrix contains n log2 n vectors, basically convolutions with log2 n basis functions.

One way to reduce the redundancy of the transform would be to enforce sparsity, keeping only at most k &lt;&lt;= n &lt; n log2 n nonzero coefficients that best reconstruct the signal. Obviously this is always possible, at worst we could use the trivial n-coefficient solution offered by the discrete wavelet transform.

I am curious whether we could get better runtime complexity for L0 minimization in this specific scenario, exploiting the special structure of the transformation matrix.

The only trick I could think so far is to work in Fourier domain with the log2 n convolutions, and use complex coefficients which represent both the amplitude and phase of the basis functions. So we would have to choose k &lt;&lt;= n complex coefficients corresponding to repeated log2 n basis functions. A greedy algorithm is possible in this case, but again, it is highly doubtful it gives optimal solution.

They are well known for researches, but many practitioners still afraid to use them or don't even consider to use. You might have heard about some of them already from different sources: Bloom filter, HyperLogLog, MinHash, etc. 

This book is NOT for scientists. It will be mainly intended for developers, but could be interesting for technology decision makers as well. 

I'm not a researcher in such topics, but an advanced used with a mathematical background. In my work I did not find any central source where I could find all such structures together with more than basic explanations. So, my goal is to merge such structures in to a few classes with a similar idea behind and explain them to the readers. The book is going to be language agnostic, because I want to give understanding how they work, but encourage users to use already maintained implementations in language they programming.

What do you think if such book could be interesting for the community as well?

If you want to learn more about the book and see the *early draft*, here is my Kickstarter campaign (for professional editing, corrections and proofreading): http://kck.st/2snB1tk

Also, I'm looking for good use cases for each described in the book problem. So, if you have one, don't hesitate to contact me :)

Hi! I've encountered an interesting problem yesterday. Basically, I need to predict some seasonal data (time series) for several days into the future. I need to do this with neural networks (this is part of the difficulty, I cannot use common methods like ARIMA here).

To my surprise, all the tutorials I found deal with prediction of just one future value. I feel confused: what is the use of knowing just one next value? Even weather forecasts usually give information for 1-2 weeks!

I haven't found any relevant tutorials, so I tried three approaches:

- Predict one value from previous i-N...i values, then include the predicted value as the ith input value, predict next one, and so on. I use LSTM here, and after a few iterations the prediction becomes very wrong.
- Train N different feedforward NNs to predict values i+1, i+2, ..., i+N based on the same input data. The plot of this abomination looks much more tolerable, but very imprecise. I suppose this is because my data is seasonal, and I only feed past values to my NNs, not seasonal features.
- Use a feedforward NN that predicts a value of particular day in particular month. Again, it looks tolerable, but imprecise, because I only feed it seasonal features, not values.

I don't really understand how to compose an input vector that would contain *both* values and seasonal features (like month and day) and what exactly it should contain.

So, are there any tutorials that actually deal with predicting more than one value?",7,7,False,self,,,,,

I am about to get a PhD in (applied) Machine Learning and I am considering what to do next.

It really seems that most of my peers are super excited to join the usual major corporations.
Hey, I totally understand: workplaces are fantastic, salaries are high, colleagues are (often) smart+interesting and you get to tackle stimulating problems every day. What's not to like?
However, the question I am asking myself is: ""what for?""

I don't really see myself working in a place if I don't deeply share the values of the company. 
In other words: I feel compelled to know that the company I am working for is actually doing something good for the world.
Don't get me wrong: I don't mean (necessarily) tackling global warming or inequality.
It would be enough to see a product which is actually good for the people, *long-term*. 

With this post I'd like to ask you two things:
1) Which are, according to you, the research bodies / NGO / startups / corporations doing some form of machine learning and whose output can be easily considered ethical (without the need of PR soul-washing efforts) ?
2) Do you guys ask yourself similar questions? Do you think the prestige of a company is enough to make it a desirable place to work in?

Any other comment is clearly very welcome. And please challenge my view if you feel like it.

Thanks for your time and attention.",118,67,False,self,,,,,

I am stealing some ideas from the [PAQ Compression algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAQ) and using an LSTM to make word predictions based on google's n-gram data set and using the probabilities from the n-gram based prediction + the probability from the image recognition to make a more accurate final prediction.

One perspective for motivation behind GANs is ""Why are we using a fixed and simple cost function instead of using a neural network in it's place? Lets *learn* the cost function!""

---

Usually, if your cost function is fixed, you just train your model normally. With GANs, the training regime is not much more [complicated](http://i.imgur.com/m83dmYy.png). You first train your model normally (the generator) and then the critic, with opposite goals (left and middle picture, reddish color signifies what parameters are updated). But since the critic could then assign a high score to everything, you make sure it also assigns a low score to real images (right picture). So the middle and right image change the same parameters and can be updated with just one cost function (this is meta now: we just described a cost function for *the* cost function). If you followed all this, viola, you actually ended up with the alternating training regime for GANs!


And this actually works, with the assumption that your critic ""doesn't change too much"" w.r.t. parameters (Lipschitz continuity). With the right model that behaves in such a way, you could've ""stumbled upon"" this thing all by yourself!

---

**My question** here is twofold:

* What sort of motivation is behind adding the nonlinearity in the output of the critic, namely the ""1 - log"" and ""log"" in the original GAN minimax formulation? It seems *more* complex and it seems like you needed a super special model anyway (DCGAN) to make it work? I sense the answer has to do something with the string ""maximum likelihood"". But isn't that just a sort of a trick to get the outputs to the range we want them, a trick which would then require a bunch of other tricks to make the GAN work properly (logD trick, adding noise etc.) and, compared to WGAN, lose a sort of elegance? I still see papers published that maximize the JS divergence with GANs. I don't see why and I'm not sure what I'm missing.

* So defining distances between two points is easy: x - y, but defining a distance between two distributions is a completely different story. There's a bunch of [statistical distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance) and integrals and logs and whatnot and there's a thing known as [Kantorovich-Rubenstein duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric#Dual_representation_of_W1) which is a theorem from a [1000 page book on Optimal transport](http://cedricvillani.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/preprint-1.pdf) which I'm not even going to try to begin to understand. 
But if you apply the duality for EMD and then check out what's the thing you minimize at the output of the critic, it's still just: x - y? I guess I just wanted to double check this and understand why not many people don't seem amazed with this haha? **Because you kind of end up with that if you just ""naively"" set up your networks as described in the beginning?**

This turned a bit less coherent towards the end, but I hope I managed to get the point across :)

So I am working on a project where I want to do live expression transfer from video similiar to this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXVspNUeiWw

I was hoping someone can give me some pointers and any help you guys can offer at, it'd be much appreciated. Here is the way I am approaching the problem thus far, which is something I have decided from my experience and some research papers I have read on this problem:

1. Do proper face feature tracking and identification
2. Match the features on each face to each other from two sources
3. Replace and blend the source video's expression to the target video's expression in order to produce a third composite video

Some more notes:
I am going to first get it to work for still images, as I figure once I get that working it will not be too hard to implement it back into video, what do you guys think? Also, if anyone can offer some specifics or help on any of this that'd be amazing. I will be updating this post with my progress, more resources, and hopefully eventually make it into a tutorial type post for everyone, so let's collaborate and then this can be an awesome tutorial for people to learn from in the future.

However, I cannot find any benchmarking of A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) vs multithreaded DQN in its full glory (double DQN, dueling, prioritized experience replay). 

The only relevant comparison I can find is in the appendix of the A3C paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783

However, it compares A3C to vanilla Gorila (i.e. multithreaded DQN with no tricks), dueling DQN (single-threaded), and prioritized experience replay (also single-threaded). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think this is a fair comparison. It'd be more convincing if the paper compares 32-threaded A3C to 32-threaded Gorila with all the DQN enhancement tricks added.

Does anyone have experience with distributed DQN? 

Under what circumstances will you recommend DQN over A3C? For example, does DQN tend to be more sample-efficient?

There are a huge number of open-source implementations online. In terms of algorithmic performance (convergence, final score, **not** code execution speed), which repo of DQN/A3C will you recommend?  ",15,11,False,self,,,,,

Also, perhaps doing a few projects together would help to get used to working on ML in a team. Another thing is motivation, having deadlines might force you to finally finish reading that chapter instead of browsing Reddit.

I am thinking it would go like this:

- Having a small discord/slack server for all the discussions.
- Reading one or two books at a time, and after the deadline for reading a chapter ends, discussing it.
- Instead of books, video courses/internet tutorials/etc. can work just as well.
- Doing some exercises. For example: implementing algorithm that was discussed in the chapter of the book we are reading and then comparing our solutions, trying to improve them.
- Working on Kaggle contests and data sets or GitHub libraries together.

If you have any suggestions on this list, feel free to make them. I know there have been other such groups in the past, but they are not very active at this point.

Here is the [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVYtXdY9IKiWrXfVT3j95dPVASJp6LkDiSW8AZHP7wauBGnA/viewform). I will make a server and send everyone an e-mail if enough people show interest.

So, what do you think? Is having such group a good idea?

I didnt see any discussion about using hand-crafted rules to tweak the outcome where the ML algorithm wasnt discriminating well based on patterns in the data. In some cases a boolean rule might fix the confusion, especially if the rule is an actual business requirement, not an ad hoc tweak.

For example, I made a classifier to categorize mixtures of chemicals. For each type of mixture, we had a hazardous class and non-hazardous class (based on regulatory status). The hazardous and non-hazardous mixtures could be basically the same stuff, so the classifier often was confused between the two classes. A boolean rule fixed the confusion perfectly.

In terms of format, here's what I've been planning:

**Format:** Authors create a thread with '[URML 2017]' tag and paper title. Filtering results in this subreddit by this tag is as simple as [filtering results with the [R] tag](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/search?q=%5BR%5D&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)

**Verification:** Authors can apply for ""Verified"" tag on their post by PM moderators. If the number of requests is rather high, it would be great if anyone has better ideas of verifying authors.

**Awards:** Rather than having a best paper award like most conferences, I'm thinking of having a best submission award (URML's BS award :D ). The BS award would be given to the submission that has the most engaging/interesting discussion. This could be done with a poll after the unconference. The award would include a prize such as increased visibility (sidebar/sticky post in the sub), special flair, etc. 

Moderation will be significantly stricter for these posts and personal attacks and general unfriendly behavior will result in bans without warning.

This unconference is an experiment to bring the ML community closer and reach a wider audience than a typical offline conference would. Hopefully this will spur discussion and feedback that can be read and seen by more than the two individuals having the conversation.

describes the normalizing flow as:

""A normalizing flow describes the transformation of a probability
density through a sequence of invertible mappings.
By repeatedly applying the rule for change of variables,
the initial density flows through the sequence of invertible
mappings. At the end of this sequence we obtain a
valid probability distribution and hence this type of flow is
referred to as a normalizing flow.""

I am not sure I understand properly what a normalizing flow exactly is and how is it different from the non-volume preserving flow in the real NVP (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) which also does the transformation of an initial density through invertible mappings.

In addition can someone give me pointers to reading material to understand normalizing flows and get an intuition as to what these different transformations are doing. For instance I am not sure I understand why we want to make a volume preserving transformation into non - volume preserving as done in the NICE (https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516) paper by adding an extra scale factor.

I've never seen anything like what I'm about to describe, but it is entirely likely I've simply missed something. I wanted to check before I go write my own model and do the whole put-it-on-arxiv-way-too-soon thing.

Specifically, let's say I'm doing a problem with car valuations (this was based on a real project). In the data you have variables like [make, model, year, mileage, color, power doors, condition rating]. Now, some of these will be present in 100% of samples, but others like color or condition rating will only be present in about 70% of samples.

In most ML settings, you'd have to discard samples with missing data. I don't want to have to do this. Rather, I'd like to train a model that can take into account whatever information is available, and if it's not available simply ignore it. That is, if we're given two samples:

* Ford, Focus, 2002, red
* Ford, Focus, 2003

We might imagine that red cars are generally about 0.5% more valuable than other colors, so when the information is available as in the first sample, our prediction of the valuation would be refined with that new information (let's say it predicts $3,160).

Is anyone aware of a model or class of models that can do this? Instinctively it seems like a Bayesian network thing, but in case it doesn't exist I was imagining making some modifications to a random forest model or gradient boosting model. The best way I can describe it is to take into account whatever information is there, and for whatever info is not there, simply ignore it / treat as a no-op. It may involve learning multiple sub-models but I'm ok with that.

Bonus info: There are some classes that contain more information than others. For example, if I give you just ""Ferrari"", with no other data, you can reasonably come up with a good price range from just that one variable; the bounds around this are tighter than ""Ford"", which has a range from cheap sedans to decked out Mustangs.

I'm creating a small *but ambitious* discussion/study group for anything related to RL including all the theoretical stuff useful for doing research in it. I see the theory as a means to a end. My end goal is to **have an impact on the real world**, not to indulge in theoretical studies just for intellectual gratification.

I intend to devote, say, 30% of my time to general theory, and the remaining 70% to reading RL papers, implementing algorithms, doing projects, trying my luck (and skills) at RL competitions, etc...

Here are a few examples of what I mean by ""general theory"":

1. [High dimensional Probability](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html) [(pdf link)](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf)

3. [Differential Geometry for ML](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/dgml)

I think some people confuse *understanding* with *being familiar with*. To me, understanding something means being able (eventually) to improve on it. Explanations are useless if they don't bring us closer to our goals. I could give you many wrong but plausible explanations of how a bicycle works.

However when I add the dropout to my input layer I find that I now have 3-4% on my validation set where it previously was closely linked to my test set.

It's proving to be quite the challenge for me though and have some open questions I'd like to discuss.

First, let me describe the data: I have videos of surgeries that have been annotated frame-by-frame with the surgical tools visible in the frame (there may be anywhere between 0-3 tools visible in each frame). Note that only the presence but not the location of the tools is known. The videos are of 1080p resolution and the tools elongated objects of about 30 pixels width. The task is to classfiy which tools are visible in each frame.

For now I want to work on each frame separately although it would probably make sense to use the temporal information later.

*Now my questions*

**Dealing with the high resolution**

Obviously 1920x1080 images are far too large to work with. However, when scaling the images down it becomes hard to distinguish between the different tools.

One easy solution that comes to mind is a sliding-window but I don't think I can use that: Given an extracted window I would want to train a classifier on it but I don't know what or if anything is visible in that window since I don't have location labels. 

While researching publications I found works on object detection like R-CNN that use a region proposal component and then classfiy the proposed regions. However as I understand it all these publications also have location labels available. So this has the same problem as the sliding-window.

Do you know of any approaches that solve this problem?


**Designing the classification head**

Given that there can be multiple or no objects in each frame I cannot use a softmax layer in the end. I had some ideas which I will outline below *but honestly have no idea how to do this properly*. Is there a standard way to do this?

&gt; Idea A: Don't use an activation function in the last layer and simply train with vectors such as [-1, -1, 1, -1, 1] where positive values are in favor of a class and negative values against a class. Then train with mean squared error.

&gt; Idea B: Have one small ""layer"" for each class fed from the second to last layer. Each layer would have 2 units and a softmax activation function trained as usual.

So the question is whether the opposite could be engineered by training lower layers of a network to do certain specific tasks?

This would be almost like feature engineering, but embedding it 1 or 2 layers into the deep network.

Does this have a name? Any links to papers? Comments?

Currently I'm using a tf-idf representation with TfidfVectorizer.fit_transform() in scikit learn and then running Kmeans and calculating cosine distances. 

For my next iteration I want to do supervised learning. I have some user data on how closely related each document is to all other documents, and I want to use it to train the model. My question is if anyone here has used scikit learn in that manner, and if they would recommend some specific approach.

I'm considering doing a similarity learning system, training the system to learn a distance function or metric that resembles the user data. A more intuitive approach to me would be to supply the user data to the dimension reduction, to make a low dimensional representation where the distances match the supplied user data. But I haven't yet found a good way to do this. 

I hope I'm not asking to much, I have been doing a lot of research and I'm still working on it but any pointers would be greatly appreciated :)

However, the improved performance of additional layers in a deep network comes at the cost of added latency and energy usage in feedforward inference. As networks continue to get deeper and larger, these costs become more prohibitive for real-time and energy-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we present BranchyNet, a novel deep network architecture that is augmented with side branches. The architecture allows prediction results for a large portion of test samples to exit the network early via these branches when samples can already be inferred with high confidence. BranchyNet exploits the observation that features learned at an early layer of a network may often be sufficient for the classification of many data points. For more difficult samples, which are expected to be infrequent, BranchyNet will use further or all network layers to provide the best likelihood of correct prediction. We study the BranchyNet architecture using several well-known networks (LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and show that it can both improve accuracy and significantly reduce the inference time of the network.

I'm making the transition from my usual SVM/Matlab background to keras/theano in python.

I love the library so far, it's got great documentation and very intuitive to write code for.  However, I've ran into a problem that I'd appreciate some help on.

I'm trying to do a binary classification on an unbalanced dataset (negative examples outnumber positives about 6:1).  To combat the imbalance, I simply resampled my data to remove some negatives - giving a 1:1 ratio.  The training data has about 6000 examples, with ~850 features.

I train a simple NN, using the automated validation split, to achieve a validation accuracy of ~83%, which I would be happy with.  I should note that previous SVM results on this dataset were in the 


    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(15, input_dim=856, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=100, verbose=1, validation_split=0.3) 

I then test the network using model.evaluate(), or model.predict(), on a completely different (blind) test set, that is also balanced, and I seem to once again achieve ~80% accuracy. Great!

However - when I test the model with an UNbalanced test set (again, with way more negatives than positives), I get lots of false positives, pushing the accuracy down to ~35%!

    scores = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)
    print(""\n%s: %.2f%%"" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))


Output for training and then testing on unbalanced dataset:

I don't quite understand why this is happening, but suspect it could be to do with the way neural networks pass the data through the network in batches?  Like I said - I've mostly used SVMs in the past, so this phenomenon is quite strange to me.

I'm also not sure why testing data display shows 32/5880 when finishing...would expect it to display 5880/5880 when complete.

I'm Daniel, and I just started a new project called Sciblox. It's an all-in-one data science package for Python3 optimised to be used in Jupyter Notebooks. Check it out on https://github.com/danielhanchen/sciblox, and the webpage documentation (just Jupyter Notebook) https://danielhanchen.github.io/

Some features include:

1. MICE, BPCA, Forests, Boosting missing data imputation
2. Auto graph selection
3. Sequential word mining methods
4. And lots more!

I was just wondering if you guys think it's going to be a worthwhile project to keep pursuing. It's my first repo, and so I want to hear any of your thoughts!",8,16,False,self,,,,,

I am relatively new to neural networks but my understanding is that feeding a sequence of one-hot vectors as input and a one hot vector as a label representing the next time step should converge. However, I can observe in training that it only learns the indexes in the vector that have been hot in the training data rather than the pattern in the sequence.

A short example:
Let's say the training data is as follows, each vector representing a single time step -
[1,0,0,0,0]
[0,1,0,0,0]
[1,0,0,0,0]
[0,1,0,0,0]

Then the predicted output should be [1,0,0,0,0] if the previous input was [0,1,0,0,0] and so on.
The actual output I am getting is [1,1,0,0,0] though.

The get_next_batch() function below returns batch_size time steps of the data set for 'batch_x' and offset by one time step for 'batch_y'.

I am trying to replicate results from this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf) in Keras. There are already some implementations of this in Keras, but using those implementations I have not been able to reproduce state of the art results as show in paper (or even close enough, close enough is a difference of 1 percentage point from paper).

Now that the introduction is done, lets focus on achieving state of art results in CIFAR-10 dataset. Here is what I have been building, to mimic the paper as accurately as I could: https://github.com/olympus999/cifar-10-wrn
I have reached validation accuracy of 92-93% using WRN-28-10 model, but according to the paper I should achieve 96% accuracy.

I did verify WRN-16-2 against original model, so this should be 100% correct (information which can be read from available visual graphs representing the CNN). Original model is visualized at the bottom of this link: https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks - there is also pytorch code from the original paper.

Any help or advice to help achieve accuracy of 95%+ is appreciated!

EDIT: I updated the text to represent the latest fixes to the architecture (based on comments below), but I still have not received the same results as in the paper. Training results of first 200 epochs (few epochs are missing from start) is available in my github: https://github.com/olympus999/cifar-10-wrn",7,9,False,self,,,,,

What I've tried is first just download them all, and then extract the images/audios. Downloading was very fast -- I felt like perhaps writing to HDD is the bottleneck. But it is still quite slow.

Then I changed it to store the video only temporarily, on SSD, and load it again, then store image/audio, finally remove the video. It's still too slow.. I doubt it's because too many processes are writing the files to the same folders, so maybe it could be improved a bit, but wanna know how experienced people are dealing with it.

Soon I realised that git isn't working for me. Working with neural nets seems way more empirical than working with a 'regular' project where you have a very specific feature (e.g. login feature): you create a branch where you implement this feature. 

Once the feature is implemented you merge with your develop branch and you can move to another feature. The same approach doesn't work with neural nets for me. There's 'only' one feature you want to implement - you want your neural net to generalise better/generate better images/etc (depends on the type of problem you are solving). This is very abstract though. One often doesn't even know what's the solution until you empirically try to tweak several hyper parameters and see the loss function and accuracy. This makes the branch model impossible to use I think. 

Consider this: you create a branch where you want to use convolutional layers for example. Then you find out that your neural net is performing worse. What should you do know? You can't merge this branch to your develop branch since it's a basically 'dead end' branch. On the other hand when you delete this branch you lose information that you've already tried this model of your net. This also produce huge amount of branches since you have enormous number of combinations for your model (e.g. convolutional layers may yield better accuracy when used with different loss function).

I've ended up with a single branch and a text file where I manually log all models I have tried so far and their performance. This creates nontrivial overhead though.",89,28,False,self,,,,,

I've had a vision for some years now about applying machine learning to teaching yet I feel like I'm at square 1.

The problem is that current methods of delivering knowledge to other people are archaic, relying more on superstition (e.g. pop-psychology) and individual experience than anything resembling scientific method (I say this as manager of an engineering degree having worked tutoring, teaching and lecturing).

There is a chasm between education researchers and teaching practitioners. Currently there is a drive to implement all sorts of e-learning but with absolutely no rigorous statistical data to support their efficacy, at least in the circles I've run in. All teachers have their own ways of delivery, that they are reluctant to change, and they all think they know the best way to learn. In fact, nobody knows what's best for learning, or in what amount (e.g. how often should we test? How long should our lectures be for these learners? How much should be assigned to reading? How much to group assessment? Who is the better speaker?)

I see the revolution that was Evidence-Based Medicine towards the end of the 20th century, and think that education is yet to go through a similar process. All teachers must complete an 'Action Research Project' during their training, but as far as I have seen, none carry out any rigorous statistics, and just about all of them are small sample size case studies full of bias. Our manager in Higher Education and Scholarship, with two education-related Masters, does not believe that statistics is much applicable to improving teaching: ""Students are all unique, how will statistics help? It wont."" I see this as a problem that needs solving.

The vision is to use computation to optimise how students learn.

The solution as I see it is integrating machine learning into a teaching platform (commonly referred to as a Learning Management System) for individualised teaching, which continually changes its delivery methods (e.g. speed of video instruction, length of session, frequency of sessions, type of media, the age and gender of the video narrator) to correlate with the individual student's statistics (age, gender, prior test scores and preferences) to optimise a goal (e.g. maximise the student's average test scores). I have plenty of course content (Youtube videos, quiz questions, exams, coursework, ppt slides, assessed group activities, interactive applets, textbook chapters, etc.).

How do I go about implementing Machine Learning to optimise the delivery of course content, and in the process discover something about how students learn best?

The only code I use currently is MATLAB. What language do I need to learn, PHP perhaps? Should I be applying for a Masters in ML? Or a course in programming?  Or should I get a business loan and hire someone that actually knows what they're doing? Or is there somewhere in the UK that would support this as a PhD project?",14,3,False,self,,,,,

Is there any kind of metric available, that would actually confirm that claim?

However, the whitening transformation increases computation time. Unlike WNN that reduced runtime by performing whitening every thousand iterations, which degenerates convergence due to the ill conditioning, we present generalized WNN (GWNN), which has three appealing properties. First, GWNN is able to learn compact representation to reduce computations. Second, it enables whitening transformation to be performed in a short period, preserving good conditioning. Third, we propose a data-independent estimation of the covariance matrix to further improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the benefits of GWNN.

They all seem very cool, and show good results. But mostly these results are either on mnist, which is to simple, or on imagenet which has a huge amount of data. The problem is that I can't find any examples of people using semi supervised learning on ""real life"" problems. 

Did anyone here ever use semi supervised learning in his work and managed to gain better results by using large amounts of unlabeled data?
Which types of algorithms do people use in the industry for this kind of problems?

This can be all the way down then all the way up (predicting or learning) or zigzagging per layer (learning). This is supposed to converge to symmetric behavior, but it appears theres always some asymmetric distortion.

Node bias is often used to adjust for this, but technically anything you can do with node bias you can do without it. Something appears unbalanced that motivated complicating the boltzmann machine energy equation with the bias vector.

Example: If the first node in each layer is always on because a huge weight is between them, then nodes in the next higher or lower layer can have weights that always raise or lower the chance they are on regardless of combinations of other nodes (like node bias is used for).

Example: If layerX usually has 20% of its nodes on and layerY learns to have only 10% of its nodes on (most weights negative), then 10% is so small that weightedSums are usually near 0 so sigmoid of that is usually near .5 so inference back to layerX gets around 50% of its nodes on and cant learn to do 20%. Unless its normed against this.

I imagine such a func could somehow be designed using statistics of how often each pair of nodes, 1 in each adjacent layer, are all 4 combinations (0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1) and sparsity ratio (observed between adjacent layers) and weights. The weights of 1 node dont tell statistics of the node since other nodes past those weights (such as inference down then up to siblings) affect the combinations they're on and how often they're on. You may have a very high weight with some node thats rarely on, so you cant tell from 1 node's weights.",0,6,False,self,,,,,

I'll just paste the comment I made in the linked thread:

Basically when I got into DL I started by using tensorflow/keras, and when I dug a bit deeper I saw that all variables were stored in FP32 by default. My first question is: why FP32? Is there actually any reason at all? I understand there must be a tradeoff between the high-cost but very precise FP64 and fast but less precise (?) FP16.

Then I started to search a bit about this, and I stumbled across different papers/articles stating that FP16 actually could give similar results than FP32, but faster. [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7024)

There is another issue related: the bottleneck from Nvidia on their consumer cards for FP16... I bought a 1080ti and tried switching to FP16 from FP32 for a training session and was like ""wait what?"" since it was much slower.

I'd love to hear your take on this: did you ever consider this parameter/what did you choose/why do you think many libraries default to FP32",15,9,False,self,,,,,

I have roughly 1500 cases of forecasts by a weather model (a lot of parameters ~ 400) with the respective ""solution"" (the measurements). I turned this into a classification forecast by assigning wind gusts &lt;= 25 knots to class ""0"" and the others to class ""1"" because it has tradition to just report wind gusts above 25 knots in meteorological ground measurements.


My current thoughts are:

- using a very easy algorithm like a perceptron as a comparison

- using some not-strongly-related algorithms for skill comparison

-- Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, maybe also some kind of neural network

-- tuning some parameters of these algorithms with cross-validation (or out of bag samples in random forests)

- answering some interesting questions:

-- does the forecast skill get significantly worse when the classification boundary is increased (25 knots -&gt; 30/40 knots) due to less cases?

-- does the forecast skill improve when cases of non-nearby other stations are added? (non-nearby to decrease correlation between the cases)

-- how about combining the forecasts of the tested algorithms? does this yield an even better forecast?


I would really appreciate any suggestions and thoughts.

I use an LSTM to forecast a time series (using a rolling forecast method). Before that, I remove trend and seasonaity from the series, which significantly imporves the quality of my forecast.

Adding seasonality back to the forecasted data is easy.

The problem is, I don't quite get how to add the trend back. Do I need to forecast the trend as well? If so, which technique should I use? Another LSTM?

My understanding:
OOB error is the error resulting in going through each sample and calculating the accuracy by a vote of those trees, which did not get that sample in the bootstrapping procedure and are therefore not influenced by that very sample. This is done for every sample to estimate the overall accuracy.

On ""https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm"" in the section ""The out-of-bag (oob) error estimate"" it says that there is no need for a separate test set. Assuming this is true, one can take the whole dataset for training and one can even estimate the expected error as well. 

What if you want to play around with some parameters like depth or amount of trees? I would guess you need a test set in that case and the OOB error within the training set tells you which parameters you should use, but you can't use the OOB error of the best parameters within the training set to estimate the expected error because you used all the data to determine the parameters. So in that case a separate test set, which was not involved in the parameter optimization, would be needed, correct?",4,5,False,self,,,,,

I didn't see any projects that showed a basic example of this in Keras so I figured I'd give it a shot: https://gist.github.com/nicksam112/00e9638c0efad1adac878522cf172484

It's able to solve several gym environments such as Cartpole and BipedalWalker just by running on a single laptop CPU. Cartpole should solve quickly, in about 10 minutes or 50 runs, while Bipedal walker may take 24 hours or 1000 runs on that same CPU. That's with a network that has two 128 node hidden layers which might be overkill, so it may be able to solve faster with a smaller network

Next step would be to allow it to be run on multiple machines which is one of the main benefits to ES, but that'll probably be as an actual GitHub project rather than a gist.

This is my first attempt implementing from scratch so any and all feedback is encouraged and would be a big help! Thanks for checking it out!

If I remember correctly, there are many works on meta-learning where RL optimizes SL/RL/UL, and all of them require gradient information of the latter. On the other hand, I naively guess that RL can be used to learn an efficient way to optimize weights without requiring gradient information of the optimizee. I want the optimal policy learnt by RL to optimize weights not too slower than SGD does and scales just as well. If this is the case, then the ES paper implies that an efficient BP-free weight optimization of SL/RL/UL is possible; hence, efficient weight optimization of RNN other than the usual architecture consisting of LSTM, GRU and their slight variants becomes possible. Needless to say, all the BP-free meta-learning works employ meta-heuristics, which make it unable to scale up and compete with BP.

I borrowed the idea from [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/122_Report.pdf) where they also stated a conv net architecture (see Fig. 5), which i applied with medium success using simple deep q learning.

I read ML papers to find novel ideas. I'd like to know that they actually work but what bothers me is that authors often only run their technique once and give an estimate of its performance. I'm skeptical that they just got a lucky random seed for their problem or they found good hyperparameters so that their idea boosts performance a lot.

I'd like to publish my own paper but I'm not a genius and I can't come up with my own novel ideas. I'd like to take some of my favourite ideas whose papers don't validate them in depth and fully test them to provide confidence intervals on the performance boost.

If I wrote a paper like this and found that a previous paper's result was a fluke then I wonder if the journal would see it as bad practice to be discrediting other authors' ideas. Do you think that this kind of research is publishable or will it be frowned upon?",18,54,False,self,,,,,
