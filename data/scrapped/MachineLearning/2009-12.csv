They are new, so there appear to be no textbooks about them. I watched the video lectures and tried reading what literature is available, such as the original publications, but, even though I have pretty good grounding in general math and some familiarity with classic Artificial Neural Networks, I feel like I'm lacking the necessary background. If you have a deep understanding of deep belief networks, what books (chapters in those books) do you recommend as prerequisites needed for learning about them?",12,9,False,self,,,,,

Right now I just have a small script that runs the Jaccard Coefficient and uses arbritray weight for each attribute(genre is weighted more for example). I have something like this : ((jaccard_by_genre * GENRE_WEIGHT)+ (jaccard_by_actors * ACTOR_WEIGHT))

I want to experiment more with various similarity coefficient and various weights for each categories. Please write down your suggestion for similarity coefficient and weights and I will try to find the best one that minimizes the RMSE.
