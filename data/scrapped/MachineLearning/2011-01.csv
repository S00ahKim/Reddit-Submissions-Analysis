It's similar to commonly-used methods to integrate weak classifiers into a strong system, except using a rolling time-window to take advantage of signal repetition.  

Background:  I'm building an algorithm to detect a repetitive but highly-variable acoustic signal - so variable that each time it occurs (approx. once per second), I only have about a 25% chance of detecting it.  But by using a long time window, say 100 seconds, I give myself 100 detection opportunities and might detect the signal 25 separate times.  Then I can roll this window forward through time, processing the data real-time as it's received, and if I have more than, say, 15 detections in the window, I can declare that the signal's been detected with high confidence.  

It's a two-detection-threshold system.  I have one threshold for my instantaneous detector, which can get about 25% Probability of Correct Classification (Pcc) with fairly low Probability of False Alarm (Pfa).  Then I have a separate threshold, 15 detections in the time window, which operates on the aggregate instantaneous detection output.  Both of these thresholds need to be determined ahead of time from training data.  

What is this type of analysis even called?  Has anyone else used anything similar?  Where can I find details on the theoretical underpinnings of this type of approach?  I'm tentatively calling this approach taking advantage of signal recurrence by using ""local context"", and it's clearly a powerful tool to improve system performance, but I am totally lacking on footnotes.  

Any thoughts, suggestions or references would be deeply appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  ",12,19,False,default,,,,,

Here's the gist of it: I have a database of scholarly articles from a wide range of categories that I've archived from the web, stored into an sqlite3 database. It stores the title of the scholarly article, the author, the general category (science/medicine/psychology/technology/etc) and the entire text of the article (~600 words on average). What I want to do is present the user with a list of these articles, and have them rate each one 1-5 stars. The hope is that over time, the system will learn which articles the user likes, and which articles the user hates, and give the user a predicted value of stars next to new articles (very similar to how Netflix shows you how much it thinks you will like a movie). The hope would be that it factored in everything, the author, the title, the categories, and the full text, to get an idea of what kind of things you liked, and also know how much weight to give each one of those factors.

The problem I'm running into is that I really don't know where to go next. I looked into document ranking algorithms, but [Wikipedia doesn't exactly tell you which algorithms are 'best', or, at the very least, most widely used.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank#Approaches). I also thought from reading [O'Reilly's Programming Collective Intelligence](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321) that I could use a Pearson correlation/Euclidean distance score to solve the problem, but that seems to only be relevant if you have multiple users to compare to, which, if I was just starting my website out, would not be possible. Plus, this seems like it wouldn't factor in all the variables needed. 

Basically, I don't know what I am doing, but I do have a good idea of what I want to do, and I figure someone could at least point me in the right direction. What type of algorithm is best suited for this type of system? Neural Network? Bayesian classifier? Are there some good books besides ""Programming Collective Intelligence"" that provide a good knowledge base of machine learning and computer programming? Is it even possible to compare so many features (title, author, category, and ESPECIALLY 600 words of the article) and get a decent ranking?",7,10,False,self,,,,,

I have a little problem and was curious if there was any research about the best way to handle such data.

So, I have a data table, each row has multiple features/class etc. But my rows are created from pairings; that is, instead of ""row1"", ""row2"" I have ""pair_1-2"",""pair_1-3"", ""pair_2-3"" etc. Basically my table is a NxN matrix of M-feature vectors.

In my feature vector I have some features pertaining to the pairing in question (kind of similarity/dissimilarity measures), those are OK. 

However I also have features from the elements that create the pairing as well. So, I'll have features such as ""SizeOf-1"", ""SizeOf-2"", the size value of the first and second element in the pairing. Those are problematic; because their order does not matter, they should be completely interchangeable; I can switch the values of size1 and size2 for randomly selected rows and it will still mean the same thing (there is no ""first"" or ""second"" in the pairing). But for classification purposes they are separate features, thus their order is of some importance to the learning algorithm. 

Thus, while the actual model is ""If any of those elements in the pair have size &gt; X"", the classifier gives two separate branches, and those branches will have less support than the actual rule (due to the fact that in some rows the first one will be &gt;X while in some it will be the second). Those features create such minor problems, increase the complexity of the model unnecessarily (and probably decreasing the accuracy to some extent) etc. 

So, how can I handle such values more efficiently? I thought about duplicating each row to have both orderings (at least the support of each rule becomes the actual one), but forcing the duplicated rows to be together in either training and test set is problematic in 3rd party server code, plus the duplication also creates some other problems in another step of our algorithm. 

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

My problem is this. I have a set of nodes. I also have a handful of links. Links and nodes are each describable in terms of features. Each link will connect exactly two nodes, in a specific order. I would like to use machine learning to determine, given a specific link, which nodes should be connected by that link. I have a whole bunch of gold standard data. How can I approach this problem?

For context, nodes in this example are named entities in a text, and the links are relations between them.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to implement a missing data algorithm in R and am a bit confused connecting their documentation with other resources out there.

Specifically, how does nlm do minimization? Is this a quasi-newton algorithm? Is it even considered first order (since you can receive the Hessian matrix as output).

Anyway, it's obvious that I'm confused, so any comments or documentation could be useful.",3,6,False,self,,,,,

The site is heavily geared towards NLP, which is fine but there is so much more to machine learning. I also find it to be too theoretical; I think most of the active members there are graduate students. Also, there isn't much activity there. 

I have been checking out stockoverflow's [stats site](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) which seems promising so far. But stats, while overlapping a huge amount with machine learning, can be slightly different. For example, questions on deep belief networks seem rare there, even though it is a moderately active area of research in the machine learning community.
