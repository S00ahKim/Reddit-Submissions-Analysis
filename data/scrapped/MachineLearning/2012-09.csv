I am a CS graduate and I just started my Masters in ML.
What I want to do is become, a really, really good ML scientist/expert/whatever.

Now, I am a big fan of ""practice makes perfect"", and the 10000 hour rule. What has been bothering me though is:

How does one ""practice"" in Machine Learning?

In other disciplines it's pretty straightforward.
If you want to become a good weight lifter, you lift.
If you want to become a great violin player, you practice violin.

How does one become ""better"" at Machine Learning though?",16,24

The problem my research professor has given me now is to classify the dataset used in Blitzer, et al (though I likely will not achieve anything like the results that some of the research teams have, given my inexperience). 
Problem number one:  using the standard, textdirectoryloader, WEKA wants to take in data that is:  A. in raw text form of some sort, rather than pre-organized into some other sort of vector or feature file.    and B.  binary in nature   

Unfortunately, the datasets provided in the Blitzer, et all are what appear to be feature vectors (you can go look for yourself).  After doing some somewhat rigorous searches, I am no more sure how to change these feature vectors into arff format, or how to arrange the directory structure.  I tried arranging the directory structure as a tree, for the most part, and it complained about all the branches, all the way down about how it was not binary.   Even with just two simple branches on one category, it didn't recognize the sparse vector nature of the data and simply assumed that the_dog:3 was a single feature, rather than something with its frequency already specified.

So what i'm asking for here is:  how do I get WEKA to take in the data in the format provided, and  how do I arrange the directories in this case so that it can be used with a multiclass classifier? 

You can see the datasets (processed) at www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/

I would like to present a [small project](https://github.com/neuromancer/libmind) i was working during the last months. 
It aims to solve the problem in Machine Learning of processing sequences of inputs, instead of a fixed size vector that many algorithms requires to perform classification or regression and also providing a minimalist interface to learn and predict sequences in almost any domain. 


The basic idea is to use an [Echo State Networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network) to generate a single fixed size vector in R^n from a sequence of inputs of vectors in R^k. Then, we can use this representation to perform some kind of classification or regression. Also, a dual procedure can be used to reconstruct a sequence of vectors in R^k from a fixed size vector in R^n.


This project is called [libmind](https://github.com/neuromancer/libmind). It is also designed to be a simple way for a programmer to learn sequences of arbitrary elements, as long as they can be vectorized.   


In the repository of libmind two examples of its use are included: 


* Identification of part of speech (POS) of English words only using their letters.

* Reduction of variableless propositional logic formulas.


I would like to hear if it can be improved and/or extended. So, in the spirit of open research, i'm publishing all the code, data and instructions, so anyone can view and improve this small project.

It can be applied to internal or external measures of quality. This paper introduces the approach and analyses it using document clustering.

Abstract:
Divergence from a random baseline is a technique for the evaluation of document clustering. It ensures cluster quality measures are performing work that prevents ineffective clusterings from giving high scores to clusterings that provide no useful result. These concepts are defined and analysed using intrinsic and extrinsic approaches to the evaluation of document cluster quality. This includes the classical clusters to categories approach and a novel approach that uses ad hoc information retrieval. The divergence from a random baseline approach is able to differentiate ineffective clusterings encountered in the INEX XML Mining track. It also appears to perform a normalisation similar to the Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) measure but it can be applied to any measure of cluster quality. When it is applied to the intrinsic measure of distortion as measured by RMSE, subtraction from a random baseline provides a clear optimum that is not apparent otherwise. This approach can be applied to any clustering evaluation. This paper describes its use in the context of document clustering evaluation.",0,1

Of course their voices sound different, they read at different speeds, etc. But let's assume:

* they read exactly the same text
* they have the same accent
* there's no coughing, hiccups, major background noise, etc.
* no major reading errors

Basically, we can assume both the reading and the recording are pretty 'clean'. What's a good algorithm to 'sync' up the recordings ?

By 'sync' I mean you somehow break up the recordings into a sequence of 'sound bites', and the two recording share the same sequence, and the algorithm should output the time each speaker spent on each sound bite. For example:

* sound-bite-0: t=[0.1,0.3] for A; t=[0.11, 0.28] for B
* sound-bite-1: t=[0.32,0.39] for A; t=[0.29, 0.35] for B

Each 'sound bite' can be a word, a syllable, a group of words, etc, but let's say sound bites should be between 0.1 to 2 seconds (or any reasonable range) in length.

There's no need to do speech recognition on the recording, in fact if they read a list of unintelligible, random syllables, the algorithm should still work. Bonus point if the algorithm works on songs too.

What would people recommend to approach this problem? At first I thought just ignore the time structure so I have 50 dims x 10 time points = 500 features. Another approach might be to define distance between two trajectories as the sum over time points of the euclidean distances in the 50dim space and then cluster the similarity matrix. Would this be better - I don't have a good intuition for how it would differ from the full 500 feature vector? Are there any better techniques or approaches?

I actually have an external labelling of the data into 6 classes - but I would like to try an unsupervised approach to see if the same comes out of the data, or if there might be more structure - and also investigation the evolution with time of the cluster structure.",19,22

Also is there any reason to prefer linearly vs exponentially decaying annealing schedules?

At first glance it looks like a time complexity question, but when it starts talking about mapping-functions and pre-sorting data, I am not sure how to handle. So how would you answer?

Here it is:

    Given a set of items X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} drawn from some domain Z, your task is to find if a query item q in Z occurs in the set. For simplicity you may assume each item occurs exactly once in X and that it takes O(l) amount of time to compare any two items in Z.

    (a) Write pseudo-code for an algorithm which checks if q in X. What is the worst case time complexity of your algorithm?

    (b) If l is very large (e.g. if each element of X is a long video) then one needs efficient algorithms to check if q \in X. Suppose you are given access to k functions h_i: Z -&gt; {1, 2, ..., m} which uniformly map an element of Z to a number between 1 and m, and let k &lt;&lt; l and m &gt; n. Write pseudo-code for an algorithm which uses the function h_1...h_k to check if q \in X. Note that you are allowed to preprocess the data. What is the worst case time complexity of your algorithm?

    Be explicit about the inputs, outputs, and assumptions in your pseudocode.

Qualitatively, they all look similar: They start at T=0, D=0, have a maximum at some point T_max, fall of (some fall off more, some less, depends on the parameters) and then they go into saturation, oscillating (due to the noise) around the value of D for T-&gt;oo (infinity).

Since the time, which the time series needs to go into saturation, is in general not known, I have to write an on-line algorithm/method (I don't save the data, it's too much) which detects when the time series is oscillating about a specific value of D and doesn't change anymore (so there is no bias/trend anymore).

Meanwhile, I'm working on this specific problem for several weeks now and I haven't found a satisfying solution yet. Is there any known method for problems like that which I don't know about yet? Do you have any ideas or a good approach?

If it is of interest: I'm programming in C (using GSL).

What I've done so far: juggling with average/variance/standard-deviation of time windows of a fixed size. My first approach was averaging over these windows and then looking for abs(WindowAverage_1 - WindowAverage_2)/WindowAverage_2 to drop below an arbitrary treshold (which I set to a small number). The time series I linked above are the result of this method. Nevertheless, I'm not sure if this is finally a good way, because although my treshold is very small, there could still be a small bias/trend which lead to another value of D than calculated with this method.


My second approach, which I haven't finished yet due to some problems, is plotting D over 1/T instead of T. The sense behind this is, that at some point I can extrapolate my data to the y-Axis (D-Axis) to receive the value of D for T-&gt;inifnity. So I reduced the problem from infinity to finite. The problem is, that with increasing T, 1/T decreases stronger and with decreasing (1/T_1 - 1/T_2) the data oscillation increases, which does not make it easier.

It functions correctly, but the speed of the algorithm leaves much to be desired.  I was wondering what some suggestions for parallelizing or scaling up the code might be.  Specifically, in a given generation, I will have 200-400 chromosomes whose fitnesses (area under ROC) need to be determined but can be done so independently.

However, an additional challenge is that the dataset changes each generation (both a resampling and noise perturbation), and thus the data might need to be synchronized if the solution is network based.

The algorithm itself is not my design, and thus I cannot change the way it fundamentally functions to speed it up.  I have heard of MPI, OpenMP, and Hadoop, but I would like to get some input before I learn a new technique.

I should note that I have decent experience with C/C++, Java, Python, C#, R, and have done a little with PHP/MySQL a while ago.  I dual boot Windows and Linux, and can use both proficiently.  I have a hexacore processor in my personal desktop, and I also have access to 10-20 desktop machines (friend's computers).

Any advice?",14,6

Later, we classified the data using J48, and one thing that hit me when looking at the result was that the root node in the decision tree (""gender"") wasn't the same feature as the one scoring the best in the IG analysis (""p6"").

I was given an .arff file of data and can easily figure out on weka how to make a decision tree, both pruned and unpruned.  What I am to do next is where I am having problems.  

I am to evaluate the results of these trees by using cross-validation, and then execute statistical tests (T and Wilconox).  We are given the hint to use experimentalComparison() in the DMwR package on R as well as the function compAnalysis() for the Wilconox test.  This is where I am getting stuck.  Is that cross-validation not part of Weka when building the decision tree?  i.e. using 10-fold cross validation.

Another issue is I can't figure out (by using Google to first try and help) to take these trees from Weka, place them in R and do these tests.  I guess a part of this problem is never having used R.  

What are some good resources on R that might help me with figuring this out?",7,3

I have a four-class classification problem where I am using both a SVM and bagging with logistic regression as the base classifier.

My validation set has 35 instances (10,8,10,7 for each class) and my test set has 38 instances (10, 9, 11, 8 for each class).  The sets are small but it's a medical imaging problem and getting more data isn't feasible.  

When I run the bagging on the validation set I get a classification rate of about 89%, and 94% on the test set.

On the SVM I get 83% on the validation set but 94% on the test set, which seems abnormal.  

I'm thinking that because the sets are so small that the difference isn't really that significant even if it looks a lot in percent form.

I know you can use t-tests to look for significant differences between two classifiers which use the same set, but how would I go about checking for non-significant difference between two classifiers on different sets?  

edit:  poor title choice.  What I am really interested in is checking for non-significant difference between the SVM on the validation set and the SVM on the test set.  The training set has 73 instances.",3,7
