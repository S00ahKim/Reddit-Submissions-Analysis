I think what I'm trying to go for in this situation is cluster analysis. If so, I'm looking for an applicable algorithm. If a better analysis exists, please point it out and what algorithm I should use.

Lets say I have a bunch of a events that occur. Each event identifies an object, and a deviation. The deviation may be an increase or a decrease of some value.

For example, lets say over a period of 1 minute, the following events occur:

    Object | Deviation
    A | +3
    B | -2.3
    A | +1
    C | +25.4
    C | +26
    D | -5.7
    E | -2
    F | +9
    D | -2

What I'd like to do, is determine which objects are clustered together--that is when an object of a cluster deviates in a direction, another object in the cluster will similar deviate. 
It would be nice if inverse deviations could also be determined such that if a cluster of objects move in one way, another cluster would move in the opposite.

Any one have any ideas on how to approach this problem?

Thanks.

25,2012-2-12,2012,2,12,15,plsop,Predicting my favourite drink - need for help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/plsop/predicting_my_favourite_drink_need_for_help/,danielkorzekwa,1329028567,"Hello,

I'm trying to solve a problem of recommending/predicting 'my favorite drink' and I'm hoping to get some support from this community.


Problem definition:
There are 20 different drinks, e.g. pepsi, coke, fanta, etc.
There are millions of customers of a supermarket who were buying those drinks over a period of lets say last three months.

Data definition:

Drinks (id,name): 100:Pepsi,101:Coke,....

Transactions
customer_id, list of bought drink ids
1 100,100,100,101,101,101
2 100, 102,106,106,106...
....

Definition of 'my favorite drink' is a bit foggy. We don't have any training data we can learn from, e.g. list of fans for a given drink, the only thing we have are transactions, and customer data (id, age, postcode).
Customer may not have a favorite drink and this should be predicted as well.

Those are 4 approaches I came up for predicting 'my favorite drink'.

1) 50% ratio - The drink, I buy the most. If the percentage of a my drink transactions is &gt;50% then this is my favorite drink. Otherwise I don't have a favorite drink.

2) Gini index, more clever version of 50% ratio, If I bought pepsi 4 times, and other 6 drinks once only each, then Pepsi is my favorite drink. Gini index = 1 minus sum of squares of drink probabilities. In this case Gini = 1 - (4/10)^2 + 6*(1/10)^2. I have a favorite drink if gini is &lt;0.7.

3) Rationale - My favorite drink not necessarily has to be the one I drink the most. For example if I bought 49 CopaCopa drinks and 51 Pepsi drinks, then CopaCopa drink is more likely my favorite one. This is based on observations that customers who buy CopaCopa are more likely to buy Pepsi (because this is generally popular drink), than the other way round. If I buy the same number of unpopular CopaCopa and popular Pepsi drinks then it probably means I'm more likely a fan of CopaCopa.

Method 3a: Naive Bayes Text classifier. For this approach I calculate priors - probability of buying a given drink using Maximum Likelihood based on all customers transactions data, e.g. P(Pepsi)=0.2, P(CopaCopa)=0.02. And then I calculate conditional probabilities of buying a drink given I also bought something else, e.g. P(CopaCopa | Pepsi) = 0.03 and P(Pepsi|CopaCopa) = 0.07.

Customer has a favorite drink if a posterior, e.g P(CopaCopa | Pepsi, Pepsi, CopaCopa, CopaCopa) (probability of being a fan of CopaCopa given I bought both Pepsi and CopaCopa twice) is &gt;50%.

Data for bayes classification (one record for a single drink transaction). Those five records represent a customer who bought three drinks 101,101,102 and a customer who bought two drinks 105:
drink_id(prior) all_drink_ids_bought_by_customer_of_this_drink_transaction(prediction record)
101 101,101,102
101 101,101,102
102 101,101,102
105 105,105
105 105,105

Method 3b: Logistic regression, I represent transactions as

Target = transaction drink id, prediction variables = percentages of drinks for a given customer, who placed this transaction, e.g. for a single customer, who bought pepsi, pepsi, and copacopa, we have three classification records (one per transaction):

target, %pepsi, %copacopa, %coke,.....
pepsi, 2/3,1/3,0,0,0,0...
pepsi, 2/3,1/3,0,0,0,0...
copacopa, 2/3,1/3,0,0,0,0...

Customer has a favorite drink if a logistic regression predicts drink with &gt;50% confidence, e.g. I take a customer who is represented by classification record: 0.1(CopaCopa), 0.7(Pepsi),0(Coke)..... I'm fan of Pepsi with a confidence level of 0.64.

I would appreciate any feedback on presented approaches. Maybe there is a better way to address this problem? I would be also glad to hear on some papers describing similar prediction problems in various domains.

I was thinking about the best technique to solve a problem I have and would appreciate any input.

Here's the problem:
I have a set of features X which get put into a unknown algorithm with parameters A. The algorithm uses parameters A and features X to classify (binary classification) X. I have a bunch of truth data, each row of which has my features X and parameters A and output Y (y=1 for correct classification, y=0 for incorrect classification). The goal is to choose a set of parameters A for new incoming features X which will maximize my chances of correct classification.

It's interesting because while some set of parameters A might work optimally for some set of features X, that same set of parameters A could completely fail given radically different inputs X.

The method I am currently considering using is some type of collaborative filtering (similar to netflix problem), where each ""movie"" is one of parameters or features from the combined set of features and parameters X,A. And each entry (""user"") is the set of values for the features and parameters that correctly classified the features.
I would then have a matrix of correct classifications and a new entry would consist of only the features X, and i estimate the values of A.

Thoughts? I would appreciate any opinions on this.

We're sorry to have to tell you that our Machine Learning course will be delayed further. There have naturally been legal and administrative issues to be sorted out in offering Stanford classes freely to the outside world, and it's just been taking time. We have, however, been able to take advantage of the extra time to debug and improve our course content!

We now expect that the course will start either late in February or early in March. We will let you know as soon as we hear a definite date. We apologize for the lack of communication in recent weeks; we kept hoping we would have a concrete launch date to give you, but that date has kept slipping.

Thanks so much for your patience! We are really sorry for repeatedly making you wait, and for any interference this causes in your schedules. We're as excited and anxious as you are to get started, and we both look forward to your joining us soon in Machine Learning!

If I have a training set and a test set each of 1000 randomly instances from a group of 70000. Would there be a problem if I had say instance X in the training set and then the same instance (X) appeared in the test set?

I'm curious if this would cause significant skewing or just general issues such that I want to go and ensure that there is 0 overlap between the 2 sets.

If there is a problem could someone explain to me what it might be? My reasoning behind why I think it might not be a problem is that I think the naive bayes is very simplistic in it's classification approach. Even if it's seen this exact instance in the past it's still going to calculate it's probabilities and classify based on those probabilities and not the fact it's seen this instance in the past, which it doesn't even remember anyways.

So if someone could help me clear this up I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for any insight.",10,5

My question is about pruning a decision tree using Weakest Link Pruning.

In Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) p 308 (pdf p 326), it says: ""we successively collapse the internal node that produces the smallest per-node increase in [error].""  My understanding is that an internal node is *any* non-terminal node.

Then, I open Programming Collective Intelligence (p 155) and while the text therein makes it sound like we're looking at *any* non-terminal node, the function they define ('prune') only tests entropy reduction on nodes that are *direct parents of terminal nodes*.

Did I understand ESL correctly, and I should be looking at *every* non-terminal node, not just those that are direct parents of terminal nodes?

For example, the input list has 100 words, John knows words in the list such as  basic words like, think, go, work, etc and harder words like sedulous, vibrissae, uxoricide, etc. From there, the app can estimate with probability 0.7 that he knows  the word ""parsimonious"" as well.

I only have basic understanding of machine learning after taking the online Stanford AI class (I did write a simple spam filter as a result). Thus, I need some pointers to know how I can solve the said problem.
