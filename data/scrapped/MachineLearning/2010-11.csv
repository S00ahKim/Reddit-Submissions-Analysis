I have a dataset of about 15 features related to object. Here's a purely illustrative example of what the data looks like.

I'd like to analyze these to get, maybe clusters of features that tend to occur together.

**Context:** I just finished writing a pretty simple machine learning library targeted at recognizing features in images (right now the only learning algorithm in the lib is an ANN). As far as I know, the 'hello world' of multi-layer ANNs is learning XOR, since the problem of mapping the inputs to the outputs is not linearly separable for that data set.

To accomplish this, I set up a 3-layer ANN with 2 inputs, 3 hidden nodes, and 1 output (all non-output layers have bias nodes added automatically). Activation was accomplished using the generic sigmoid function. It took much less than a tenth of a second for the ANN to learn the data.

I was suddenly intrigued by what the output of the neural net would look like over its full trained domain, so dumped the numbers and generated the graph using **QtiPlot** (probably the best open-source data analysis &amp; plotting software I've ever seen). Result = fucking awesome and elegant, so I thought I'd share.

I started thinking about the elements of a good essay and how writing shows up in class. My mind drifted to machine learning as a tool to flag articles which do not match the rest.

I am constructing features for doing some ML. Some of these features are part categorical and part numerical.  For instance, take the shortest path from node A to node B on a graph.  There are two basic ""categories"" of this feature (finite vs infinite), but if you look within the finite paths, there is a natural numerical ordering:

[Inf Inf 2 4 5 2 Inf 3 5 8...]


How do you handle such a feature in a classification/clustering scenario? I can just use it as an ""all or none"" categorical feature, but that fails to exploit the feature values in the ""all"" group.  I could use some kind of two-stage heuristic approach, but I'm not sure if there are better methods out there.
