I'm in a need of any input regarding my current project so let me ask you a question.

I'm working on unsupervised anomaly detection. I use an ensemble of algorithms for detecting anomalies in the same data. One algorithm is based on frequent pattern mining, another is on PCA etc.

Each of these algorithms outputs an outlier score for each item in my data set; let's call these 'raw scores'. These raw scores could be on various scales; e.g., the raw scores of algorithm #1 are between [0,1], of algorithm #2 between [-inf, 0]. Even if two algorithms score on the same scale, the interpretation of the scores could be different (one is purely probability, the other is not).

My goal is to calibrate these scores and put the raw scores from all algorithms on [0,1] with the following requirements:

- the same calibrated score has the same interpretation across all of my algorithms so that I can compare the scores of different algorithms,

- the same calibrated score has the same interpretation across all of my data sets so that I can compare the scores of different data sets.

So far, my best approach was to score the training data set with my algorithms and somehow use the distribution of the raw scores to calibrate. For example, I used a sigmoid function to convert the normalized raw scores to scores between 0-1. But then, I was a bit disappointed because that forced me in a way such that a fixed portion of calibrated scores went beyond the threshold of anomalousness (let's say, 0.5) now matter how normal my data were (and I don't want normal data to have high scores).

It might be that my requirements are contradicting but I couldn't prove it so far.

Can you point me in the right direction? What should I look into? I'm aware there is a whole area of calibrating the raw scores of supervised algorithms into probabilities (Platt scaling, isotonic regression) but those methods need labels which I don't have.

Thanks for all ideas!",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Problem:
I am tasked with generating all of the art assets for a video game.

I have a large database of art assets from already existing games. Lets say for arguments sake all of these assets are organized in similar groups.

In the case of utilizing machine learning algorithm I would tell the program to analyze the assets then generate 100 similar assets. I would then pick the top 10 and repeat the process until I got assets I felt were usable for what I currently needed.

Is this correct?

v = self.momentum * m - lr * g

where m is the previous weight update, and g is the current gradient with respect to the parameters p, lr is the learning rate, self.momentum is a constant, and v is velocity.

new_p = p + v = p + self.momentum * m - lr * g

and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent works as follows:

new_p = p + self.momentum * v - lr * g

new_p = p + self.momentum * (self.momentum * m - lr * g ) - lr * g

When making my convolutional net and going up from 3 to 4 to 5 layers I noticed weight initialization becomes more and more difficult.  Weights are initialized by random
weights drawn from Gaussian distributions and the network seems to be very sensitive to the weight scale:
 
    for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
      model['W%d' % i] *= weight_scale.

# a weight_scale of 0.05 results in a network that learns, with other values the network learns nothing

So I looked to the MSR style of weight initialization (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852v1.pdf and http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html) and tried to implement this to get rid of the weight scale hyperparameter. I implemented this as 
    
    model['W1'] *= np.sqrt(2.0/(3*filter_sizes[0]**2)) # first drawn from gaussians with model['W5'] = np.random.randn(FC, num_classes) etc
    model['W2'] *= np.sqrt(2.0/(F1*filter_sizes[1]**2))  
    model['W3'] *= np.sqrt(2.0/(F2*filter_sizes[2]**2))
    model['W4'] *= np.sqrt(2.0/(H * W * F3 / 64))
    model['W5'] *= np.sqrt(2.0/(FC * num_classes))

But unfortunately the network does not seem to converge when trying to overfit a small portion of the training data. Is this a correct style of implementing the MSR style?

Is it similar to this code in Torch (from http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html)?
  
    -- initialization from MSR
    local function MSRinit(net)
      local function init(name)
        for k,v in pairs(net:findModules(name)) do
          local n = v.kW*v.kH*v.nOutputPlane
          v.weight:normal(0,math.sqrt(2/n))
          v.bias:zero()
        end
      end
      init'nn.SpatialConvolution'
    end

Especially for the first layer the sigma becomes 0.27 which is quite large compared to the other layers (approximately 0.08, 0.08, 0.04, 0.04) but logical when considering the small amount of inputs (3x3x3=9). Filter size is 3x3 and 3 channels",3,3,False,self,,,,,

Our lab is seeking suggestions and participants for a 3D peekaboo game inspired by Dr. Luis Von Ahn's ideas in human computation (see here for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ht4qiDRZE8). Our game ""impressionist"" (http://impressionist.heroku.com, http://github.com/antantantant/impressionist) challenges players to quickly identify 3D objects through collaboration.

It's a bit like 3D pictionary. The game will either match you up with an available human player, or a computer with one of the best ""saliency"" algorithms available. As a human, you will either be a drawer or a guesser: if you see a 3D object, hold S and drag the mouse over parts of the object you think will most help the other player gues what it is. As a guesser, you will see the object start to take shape, and you need to guess as quickly as possible what object it is. 

 The game data contributed by players will help us to better understand the relationship between geometries and human perception. Potential applications include saliency-preserving mesh reduction, more efficient 3D object identification, 3D printing and scanning, and product design.

Thanks!

Of course I could always just reshape the matrices into vectors and use regular old logistic regression and gradient descent, but there's important information in their spatial structure that would be lost. (If it matters, the matrices are essentially arrays of correlated time series data, with each row being a time series of readings from some sensor and each column being a snapshot of all sensors at a given instant.)

We'd like to make retail item recommendations based on what our customers see/do in our physical retail stores. After evaluating different products we narrowed it down to two finalists:


**LiftIgniter**


I've looked at LiftIgniter and they fit the bill in terms of recommendations, but their system seems very geared to standard e-commerce sites. They use actions such as page views and conversions to calculate and perform recommendations, which isn't something that our project will have. We've spoken to them about our product and they said that we can still make it work with their system. In order to do that we would have to submit our data by essentially emulating what would be a page view/conversion/whatever with whatever event we have.


**Seldon**


Seldon is an open-source solution, so it's very customizable and has a lot of features to offer. There might be a little extra effort involved in setting things up, but after that's done we would have more flexibility in terms of what we can do and tweak, not to mention that we would send our data in our way. I think the fact that we can change anything we want is great, but we haven't even started gathering information so I'm not sure if maybe I'm getting way too ahead of myself.

My question is: When getting started with these kinds of systems, is it very important to have that kind of flexibility available from the beginning? Or is it better to get things started quickly, gather data, and port it over to a more robust &amp; flexible solution later on?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

In the past days we have been hacking around and made an initial design http://datazoo.club/maybe/ref=rml. As a first step we decided to support classification, but other tasks could be added shortly. We really aim for simplicity and rapid implementation with good enough results, e.g. a best guess prediction to be used for non-critical functionality. 

We are just curious if this is something that could make your life easier. What do you think?

Tell me about when you got started.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3rpjzi/machine_learning_peoples_tell_me_about_when_you/,DancesWithPizzas,1446775179,"Hi everyone.  So I'm really into machine learning and all things 'data sciency'. I've got a handful of years working in the public sector doing data analysis/research kind of stuff (nothing like apply ML techniques though). I'm also in grad school part-time in the NYC area, in a non-CS department though the majority of my classes have been CS/Stats related (think ML, NLP, algorithms, distributed computing, etc.). My school program is kinda like machine learning for the social sciences. I'm thinking about switching jobs into a company that does more ML kinda of stuff. But when I look at these job posting I see a lot of requirements about pure CS backgrounds, etc. Which is kinda of troubling since I don't have that structured CS training (rather I learn it as I go or when necessary).

For the folks who work in a ML role or at a company as such, does this background matter? Do you look for people with really solid training a CS? Also, what was is like when you started after school? Was the work load completely different than what you saw in school? More difficult, less difficult? Thanks in advance.

Apologies for the long wall of text, I promise I tried to keep it concise :/

I am going to start by presenting an analogy of the problem I am trying to solve.

&gt; Suppose I am monitoring the commercial activity at a shopping mall, and that my goal is to . Each customer **i** that enters the mall is monitored until he leaves it, for a duration of **n_duration(i)** minutes. At each minute, I collect **n_param** parameters on the visitor's activity. Let's say I am trying to predict **n_target** parameters (e.g., number of seconds not moving, distance to the book store over that minute), based on **n_input** parameters (e.g., number of steps walked / number of words spoken during that minute), with **n_input + n_target = n_param**. I collect this data for every customer that comes to the shopping mall after 2pm and leaves before 5pm and end up with a collection of **n_customers** input and target arrays, of respective sizes **n_duration(i)**x**n_input** and **n_duration(i)**x**n_target**.

Note: the dummy parameters presented here don't necessarily make sense, but let's suppose we can have reasonable confidence they are linked somehow.

I previously tried to train a vanilla neural network (MLP) to solve my problem, and got relatively satisfying results. One of my main problems was that the MLP could not capture the continuity in the input parameters I fed it (for instance, it is clear that the *distance to the book store* parameter shouldn't vary widely between time steps due to space-time travel limitations).

I have then tried solving my problem using recurrent neural networks with Torch. While most tutorials I found deal with classification on image / text data, I am trying to do regression over scalar quantities, therefore I had a bit of trouble troubleshooting what was wrong in my problem formulation, but hey, at least I learnt some stuff :)

Anyway, I tried training RNNs/LSTMs over my dataset, and I found that I had to deal with a batch size parameter, and I am having trouble figuring out what it does exactly.
On my old regular MLP, I would just feed it each input sample with the corresponding target, one after the other, but now I have to split my full dataset into smaller batches.

**My first question is: what exactly are these batches?**

My first understanding was that they regroup samples into sequences that are temporally linked, which I got from the description of the corresponding field in [this example](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn/blob/master/examples/recurrent-language-model.lua#L19):

    cmd:option('--batchSize', 32, 'number of examples per batch')

However, in [https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua#L48](this example), the description is as follows:

    cmd:option('-batch_size',50,'number of sequences to train on in parallel')

I'm a bit confused now, as in the first case, I had in mind that the RNN processed each example after the other and learnt the time dependency that way, but the second description appears to me like a way to accelerate the training (as in parallel programming), without time consideration. In this second description, time would be taken into account through the ""sequences"" mentioned. In other words:

* Description 1 seems to say that a batch is a sequence (successive samples)

* Description 2 seems to say that a batch is a collection of sequences processed in parallel for computational efficiency

I guess both make sense on their own, but is one of these definitions more prevalent than the other? I think this particularly makes it difficult to find the right resources to learn about it (I'd be very grateful for some pointers on this matter).

**My second question is: how should the batch size influence the way I feed my dataset to the RNN?**

I used the first definition, as I based my code on this tutorial, but my understanding of it may also be flawed. In the toy example I described, each batch would correspond to a dataset relative to a given customer. However, the batch size apparently needs to be unique, which is problematic here, as customers can have very different visit durations. For instance, let's simplify and say I have three customers, that respectively stay 60, 90, and 110 minutes. Ideally, I would want to train my RNN with the first sequence of 60 samples, then 90m then 110. However, the RNN implementation requires as input a (torch.Tensor) 3D matrix of fixed size **n_batches**x**batch_size**x**n_input**, and I cannot have different sizes per batch. I tried two things:

* taking batch_size = max(sequence_sizes), here 110, and padding the shorter sequences with zeros: unsatisfying results as some sequences require adding a lot of zeros

* finding a smaller batch size that could ""make sense"", e.g. each customer goes to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but I couldn't observe anything vaguely periodic.

* deciding on an arbitrary batch size. For instance, with a batch size of 20 minutes, the first customer's 60 minutes then appear like three customers visiting for 20 minutes.

For now, I settled on the third option, as I think it was the lesser evil among these options. While I have relatively fine results after training my RNN with my dataset split like that, I am still not satisfied about my understanding of it.

My concerns are as follows:

* I lose some information relative to similar patterns across customers: for instance, each visit starts and ends in the vicinity of the entrance/exits, which does not appear anymore when splitting the dataset into smaller sequences.

* I am not sure about this one, but could some temporal discontinuity appear in the RNN's predictions? When trying to predict the behaviour of a customer staying 80 minutes, I currently have to split this dataset into four batches of 20 samples. It is not clearly visible on the resulting predicted data, but the way I see it, if the four batches are processed independently, couldn't they be discontinuous with each other? For the prediction phase, I would rather try to send a single batch of 80 samples at once in order to preserve continuity, but I get size mismatch errors when trying to do so. Are RNNs tied to a specific batch size once they're trained, or am I just doing something wrong in my code?

I realise my message is very long, so thank you very much if you've read this far.

If the model predicts 50% then it's uncertain if it will be 1 or 0. Then I could make the cost function:

sum(abs(correct value - percent prediction)) or sum(sqrt((correct value - percent prediction) ^ 2))

I'm not sure how convex this cost function would be, but I could implement a linear classifier (using the optim function in R or equivalent) using any cost function I like, but I don't think I'd be able to do it for other non-linear models like random forests, GBMs or neural networks.

Seems like it would be hugely helpful. 

I could imagine various scenarios where if someone purchased agar + a pressure cooker, vs pectin + a pressure cooker, it means an awful lot from just those two data points. 
One is making sterile agar, and likely doing something with bacteria and fungi/mushroom growing - while the other is most likely just making a jam or jelly and is into food preservation. 

This would be helpful to know what to advertise to them next, petri dishes, or mason jar lids.  

With more customer data and ad feedback you could get even better at finding their niche interests and advertise relevant products.

[Karpathy's char rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua) has been the means with which I've picked up torch on a beginner level. 

As I understand it, the nn library does not at any point modify inputs sent to the forward function or the backward function. Those inputs are used to update values and gradients for various modules (values that are internal to the module), but at no point are the inputs themselves modified. 

As a question that I have, at these two places: [1](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua#L247), [2](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua#L272), a clone is performed. A clone allocates an entirely new space in memory. Why is this necessary?

So I understand why [3](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua#L192) is necessary. At each timestep, the model has different activation/gradient values and therefore you need a clone for each timestep. That makes sense. But are these clones sharing the same weights and parameters? How does torch then accumulate gradients across all the timesteps? 

But going back to the previous example, why can you not pass in the same h_init for the first call to forward in any pass of a batch? Is this necessary for cuda? 

I guess if someone could just give a run down of what I'm missing here, and how torch and nn and nngraph actually does what it does specifically in this context that would be awesome. ",2,3,False,self,,,,,

Overall, I got an 8.4x speedup on my toy problem with 10 instances, although tuning of various parameters seems necessary, and I'm sure there are lots of improvements that could be made to the library to make it better.

The basic idea is you have a magical tensor which will sync across machines.   If you add some value to it on one machine, the change will very quickly propagate, approximately at first, then accurately, to other machines.   That makes these tensors great for storing parameters for data parallelism or any other intermediate values for model parallelism.

Sethbling's mario videos inspired me to want to learn machine learning, specifically genetic algorithms (and neural network?) for games:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Y_I9vY8Qw
* Here's his source code: http://pastebin.com/ZZmSNaHX

##I want to do that, but how?

My goal in the next few months is to do that with a super small game, like tic-tac-toe, and progressively try more complex games, like agar.io. I have a background in user experience and web design, but not programming


I tried Andrew Ng's ML coursera class, but after the first week [I felt really overwhelmed with the math](http://i.imgur.com/1N6CjXC.jpg) which was disheartening.


I'm currently 2 weeks into this other ML Coursera Class:
[Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations). It's still hard for me, but I haven't gotten blocked yet. So far I've done some simple feature modeling on a housing prices data set using Dato's graphLab and python.

Because I don't have a programming background, I've spent the last few months learning python on Codeacademy. I'm enrolled in the [Programming for Everybody (getting started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome), but so far it seems a little basic. SethBling (the mario cart ML video guy), uses  Lua.

####Future projects/homework:
1. [Try n-armed bandit problem](http://outlace.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Part-1/)
2. Finish codecademy python courses (40% remaining)
3. Try [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)

4. [Read Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](http://outlace.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Part-1/)
seems a bit over my head, I'm wondering how beneficial this actually is

5. Tic-tac-toe with a genetic algorithm.

so what i knew so far is that RNN is the one suffer most from Vanishing Gradient/Exploding Gradient due to their BPTT because the linear transition when you integral back.

LSTM is the most popular way to deal with this problem by adding Cell, Forget Gate, Input Gate and Output Gate

To the best of my knowledge, cell is a storage of errors which normally in FNN it can be computed when the inputs of system have pass through the network til you see the outputs of it and comparing it with target outputs.
The cell keep the error not to change until Forget Gate is set to zero which will be exactly the same time that Input Gate is set to one and writing something down.

What confusing me the most is that... the equation below:

i_t = sigmoid(W_i*[h_t-1,x_t] + b_i)

C_hat_t = tanh(W_c*[h_t-1,x_t] + b_c)

Lately, I've been trying to predict the next sentence given the past two sentences. This is done by sequence to sequence learning as Google did [here](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf).

So far, I've had a pretty basic model with this set up in Keras:

    model = Sequential()    
    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables_encoding, return_sequences = True)) #LSTM layer 1
    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables_encoding, return_sequences = False)) #LSTM layer 2
    model.add(Dropout(dropout))
    model.add(Dense(hidden_variables_encoding))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(RepeatVector(y_sent_len))
    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables_decoding, return_sequences = True)) #LSTM layer 3
    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables_decoding, return_sequences = True)) #LSTM layer 4
    model.add(Dropout(dropout))
    model.add(TimeDistributedDense(y_matrix_axis, activation = 'softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam') 

However, I'm now looking into *transfering hidden states* in between LSTM layers. This would be such that LSTM layer 1 transfer its hidden state to LSTM layer 2, layer 2 transfer to layer 3, and layer 3 transfer to layer 4. 

My question in all of this is: **Why does transferring hidden states help the neural network learn?** Why is it advantageous to transfer hidden states as opposed to just initializing each LSTM layer normally? 

In addition, I have another question. What is the difference between:

    model.add(LSTM(512)) #LSTM with 512 memory cells
    model.add(LSTM(512)) #LSTM with 512 memory cells

and

""shape(output) = (shape(value) - ksize + 1) / strides

where the rounding direction depends on padding:

    padding = 'SAME': Round down (only full size windows are considered).
    padding = 'VALID': Round up (partial windows are included).""

I can't understand the formula above. I am familiar with following formula: shape(out) = (shape(value) - ksize + 2*pad)/strides+1.

Are the two equivalent?

For example, let's say shape(value) = 9, ksize = 3, strides = 2, and padding = 'SAME'.

In the first formula the shape(output) will be (9-3+1)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 and rounding down results in 3.

In the second formula the shape(output) will be (9-3+2*1)/2 + 1 = 5

It doesn't seem to be the same formula. Even if I round up the first one, the result will be 4.

In addition to that, the padding definition seems to be inverted. Isn't the 'SAME' padding that includes partial windows?

In Auz, the only mathematics degrees around is called a 'mathematics and statistics' I am guessing that this means that the degree encompasses statistics and maths in general. If the degree isn't purely statistics, will it at all help me in my computer science degree? Computer science degree already has maths courses, am I being silly stacking up on extra maths I probably wont need?

On the other hand will electrical engineering, major in computer engineering, help me with artificial intelligence on robots?

Kudos for the effort.  However, the disclaimers on what they are open sourcing is very worrying and with the performance benchmarks coming in I think this worry has some justification. 

A few words about our experience. A university lab. We have been developing our models on torch until now, and we are on the language understanding domain. With LSTMs and other weird architectures that work in practice but have no sound theorethical justification, we have to try different architectures all the time. Then a flow graph makes a lot of sense, so we have been getting by with nngraph etc. For us, TensorFlow is a godsend. 

Google's power, all the know-how. I was so excited. 

What is to do though? Switch to a pseudo-commitment which becomes irrelevant when you go beyond the capacity of a single machine? Deep learning only works at scale though, no? What do I do if my model doesn't fit 4-GPUs. Email it to Google so they can run it in their real infrastructure/non open source software?

Overall I am worried. TensorFlow sounds like a plan by a company (a great one, you guys rock), to increase the pool of talented engineers that understand their software to ease their hiring.

Is it even realistic for someone with my background?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3sknex/whats_the_best_way_to_go_about_transitioning_to_a/,Cant_Find_Library,1447358819,"Background:

I was drawn to programming since I was very young.  I taught myself Python in eighth grade, and continued to work on small personal projects throughout high school and college.  I never got any formal CS education, and haven't ever felt competent enough to publish code online.  I think there might be a lot of gaps in my basic CS knowledge.  However, over the past 6 months I've been coding and studying a lot (good OOP practices, good general programming principles, etc...) and feel that I've managed to fill in at least some of those gaps.

I graduated from a good school (nowhere close to top 10, but it's a private school that you've probably heard of) with 3.8 GPA and a B.S. in Math.  I then did flight school and flew for the military for a few years.  I like aviation, but it's not something I really chose for myself and I would hate to do it as a career for the rest of my life.  So I'm 26 and trying to figure out where to go from here.

What I really want to do is something with ML.  I've coded some basics recently (basic 2-layer feed-forward NN's, using genetic algorithms and an artificial life simulation to learn and evolve, all coded from scratch, even the physics engine!), but I'm not sure where to go from here.  I visited CMU recently, hoping to learn what I needed to do to give myself a good shot at getting into their ML Master's program, but was very disappointed to learn that one of the largest programs in the country has a 3% acceptance rate.  It's something I may still try for in a year, but I now know I shouldn't base my life plans solely on my chances of getting into one of the few ML programs around (Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, MIT, etc...).

Some good things:

* I am self motivated and can learn on my own.
* I have the time and the savings to sustain myself to take a year and just self-study.  I know there are a lot of good resources online to learn ML concepts, and I can use those.
* I love coding.
* My good GPA will work for me if I go in a direction where it's relevant (e.g. apply for decent, but not top, CS MS programs).

Some bad things:

* My statistics background is weak.  Somehow I just never took the classes, despite my degree.  I can fill that gap in with self-study, but my transcript won't reflect that.
* My CS background is all but zero.  No formal education and no work experience.  Just a lot of personal projects and experience in C++, Java, and Python.
* I have work experience, but it's completely irrelevant to CS/ML.

My options as I see them:

* Self-study for a while and hope I get into a ML grad program.  Maybe try to find a CS/ML research opportunity at my local state university to increase my chances.  (It seems to me, especially after my CMU tour, that I probably wouldn't get in because of my lack of CS/stats background, and I would end up just wasting a year or two self-studying and end up in trouble, with my savings running low and no good plan).
* Self-study for a while, put code out online, and hope someone eventually hires me because of it?  (This option is even scarier than the first...what if I delude myself into thinking I'm making progress, when I'm really just mucking about at an undergraduate level, and then eventually my savings dry up and I have no plan and no options?)
* Lower my ambitions a little bit, try to get into a normal CS M.S. Program, and then maybe try to get into ML later.  This seems like an unattractive option to me, because I definitely don't want to be a non-specialized coder.  I spent enough time on Slashdot when I was younger to know that being a generalist code-monkey is not something I want!
* Recognize that it's too late for this dramatic of a career transition and resign myself to a career as a pilot.

I'm lost and could really use some guidance and advice.  A lot of people in my life are telling me to just give in and fly for career, and I'm starting to fear they are right.  Where do I go from here?  Thanks in advance for the time, knowledge, and wisdom shared!

**Edit: Thanks so much for all the help!  I will continue asking questions below and PM'ing some of you for a few days if you all don't mind...there are a few things I'm still going to respond to!  It seems that a combination of options 1 and 3, shoot for grad programs, are my best choices.  Apparently I was underrating a general CS degree: I just need to pick the program carefully and make sure I can do some ML things.  I still have a lot to figure out over the next year before I apply (I likely will need some classes to fill in some CS/stats gaps if I want to get into a really good program) but I'm motivated now and know where I'm headed.  Thanks so much for all the shared knowledge, you all had a real positive influence on my life today.  I hope future searchers will get something out of this thread as well!**",29,24,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to pass a list into feed_dict, however I'm having trouble doing so. Say I have:

    inputs = 10 * [tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(batch_size, input_size))]

where inputs is fed into some function ""outputs"" that I want to compute. So to run this in tensorflow, I created a session and ran the following:

    sess.run(outputs, feed_dict = {inputs: data}) 
    #data is my list of inputs, which is also of length 10

but I get an error, TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. However, I'm able to pass the data element-wise like so:

    sess.run(outputs, feed_dict = {inputs[0]: data[0], ..., inputs[9]: data[9]}) 

So I'm wondering if there's a way I can solve this issue. I've also tried to construct a dictionary(using a for loop), which gave me the same error. 
I also wasn't sure where to post this question, there doesn't seem to be an established google group at the moment.

Edit: So the issue was with:
         inputs = 10 * [tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(batch_size, input_size))]
Instead it should be implemented as:
         inputs = [tf.placeholder(...) for i in range(10)]
Thanks for the help/suggestions.

This is the basic example I've come up with for just passing some data through a LSTM with no learning going on, its useful for understanding how to set things up.

My takeaways from writing this are:

 * Getting the inputs in is a little weird, since the recurrence loop is built with a python loop. Because of this I had to define the input, then use tf.split to break it into discrete timesteps. Split also keeps the dimension you split on, so there is a reshape in there as well. If you aren't comfortable with list comprehension, it feels like something you will want to bone up on for TF.

 * Variable initialization is an operation you run, not a function you call. This threw me off (coming from theano), I assumed tf.initialize_all_variables() was what I needed, but you have to actually pass that into the session. Makes sense in hindsight.

 * Conditionals aren't documented at all on the tensorflow website, but are in the library. This is how we 'bail' from the recurrent loop for variable length sequences. check out rnn.py for how it is used in action. Same idea as theano's ifelse.

 * For variable length sequences you will need to build the graph out to the maximum length you want to support, then exit early during runtime. You can pass in the bail point for your sequence at each .run() call, since the conditional check is in tensorflow and not python. 

 * You are going to need to pad your input to the maximum size of the loop. I didn't play with tf.pad enough to figure out if you can actually pass in variable length sequences to the .run() call, but the inputs you pass to the rnn when constructing it needs to be the maximum length so I had to make the placeholder that long. Worst case is you will need to pad your data before passing it into .run(), I assume the pain of this is lessened with the Queue setup that is available.

I'm currently looking into utilising a CNN learned on text (several different architectures[1][2][3][4]) for multi-label text classification. I found this report (https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/BergerMark.pdf) but it was missing some informations and I am not sure it is correct (it's just a students report, not a paper):

We then add a fully connected output layer of size |L| with a sigmoid activation function, which produces a probability for each of our potential labels. y =  (Uc' + b^o)

Is `U` supposed to be the dropout matrix? I don't know. Also from my understanding one can't model multivariate dependent probabilities with the sigmoid function, or is it only dependent on the error function I use? I'd need to do some thresholding on the dependencies (summing to one) to say this is positively associated with the input x^i.

I didn't found that much (read: almost none) papers on this topic. Especially using CNN/RNN/DBN/DBM/RBMs/ANN etc.

Some other possibilities I've found or came up with include using 2^n softmax outputs modelling a label power set (I think it should be ok, because n = 8 in my specific case, untested yet). Also I wanted to have a look at cross-entropy as an error function for this case[5], but not sure yet (well, mostly because I have to do some reading about this).


I'd love some clarification or hints on my thoughts. I was not able to find papers on the basics (sigmoid/logsoftmax/cross-entropy etc for multi label) and thus cannot verify any of this. If you can provide any resources I'd be glad if you could refer me to them! I'm looking forward to your input.


TL;DR: Can I use sigmoid/log softmax for multi-label? Does it model label interdependence? If not, can I incorporate this without label power set?

It would be nice to have a regression loss function which also penalizes a discordant sign. So, maybe, when my ideal value is ""+10"", then ""-5"" isn't much better than ""+100"", because it is closer to ""+10"" but it has the wrong sign.

- Let's say my program is sitting with the start state of a chess board, and doesn't know any tactics/strategies, it only knows the rules of chess, and that own piece elimination or own loss is bad, and opponent's piece elimination, and opponent's loss is good.
- It knows it has to make a move decision out of the 20 (or whatever) possible first moves.
- Since it doesn't know any move being better than any other move, all moves are ""equally valuable"".
- ""Equally valuable"" gives the first clue that we should perhaps assign ""probability"" to each move. So 1/20 to each move. And that the learning process should adjust these probabilities so that the next time the program starts a new game, not all moves are equally valued (have equal move probability) and either the move with highest prob. is picked, or a move is picked by sampling the probability distribution of moves.

So my question is, what kind of learning algorithm helps with updating these probabilities? how is it different if the probability is updated every time a piece (own or opponent's) is eliminated, vs, updating probabilities at the end of a win or loss, vs, a combination of those? finally, how can a ""hierarchical"" probability model is built such that, there are probabilities assigned to, not only each move, but to each tactic (which themselves are learned not fed), as well as each strategy (which also is learned).

I guess it would be a combination of ""reinforcement learning"", ""hierarchical bayesian modeling"", and so on. But I'd appreciate, if anyone can point out specific resource for this kind of approach (not necessarily for chess, but preferably for a combinatorial problem, not things like images, signals, etc).

Also please note that I'm somewhat aware of typical approaches for chess programs (graph search, hard coding openings, end-games etc), I'm not looking for those approaches. (I guess I'm looking for a method that would most mimic the way a human chess newbie learns and improves. Though part of chess training includes ""explicit"" learning of many tactics, strategies, openings, and end games; let's say I want to ignore that for this simple learning approach).

My ultimate goal is to use this on genomics data, so as a first step I thought I'd rebuild the second tutorial, from a 2d neural network in a 1D network that will handle the image data in a 1d vector, just like tutorial 1 did.

    Much of information sits in an unprecedented amount of text data. Managing allocation of these large scale text data is an important problem for many areas. Topic modeling performs well in this problem. The traditional generative models (PLSA,LDA) are the state-of-the-art approaches in topic modeling and most recent research on topic generation has been focusing on improving or extending these models. However, results of traditional generative models are sensitive to the number of topics K, which must be specified manually. The problem of generating topics from corpus resembles community detection in networks. Many effective algorithms can automatically detect communities from networks without a manually specified number of the communities. Inspired by these algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical Latent Semantic Mapping (HLSM), which automatically generates topics from corpus. HLSM calculates the association between each pair of words in the latent topic space, then constructs a unipartite network of words with this association and hierarchically generates topics from this network. We apply HLSM to several document collections and the experimental comparisons against several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promising performance.

http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/pledge/

~~I observe that their CLA (to which one must agree before they will accept any pull requests into Tensorflow) requires one to give them a perpetual irrevocable license on any patents that one owns. They do not reciprocate and grant contributors any license.  Further, It occurs to me that if their intention was purely defensive, there wouldn't be any reason they would withhold a grant of a patent license to contributors. The only reason to withhold it is if they wish to retain the option of prosecuting their patents against others.~~

~~In other words, under the CLA, all their patents belong to Google and all your patents belong to Google.~~

~~The pledge says that they intend to prosecute their patents only if someone else goes after them first. But under the terms of the CLA, a contributor has already granted them a license. So why is there any reason not to grant a contributor a license? Will their pledge be legally binding if they later change their mind? Is a pledge posted on their website as good as a clause in a contract?~~

~~I don't want to be an ingrate and fail to recognize that they have made a wonderful tool available to us in open source fashion. But let's not forget they have deep learning related patents, and who knows what future patents they may obtain.  It seems there's a very real possibility of stupendously valuable advances in machine learning being contributed ultimately to Tensorflow source code base (from academia or other commercial entities) and Google having a monopoly on their commercial application.~~

Edit:
Oops. I now see in the Apache license it does explicitly grant a patent license. Sorry to waste everyone's time with a false alarm.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

At first I was thinking I should delete this post, but it's equally interesting that by using TensorFlow one is granted license to Google's patent estate (and that of other contributors). It makes sense that one has to agree to the CLA (before they can accept one's pull requests), otherwise they wouldn't be able to grant the patent license in the software license.

We then use rows of matrix W as vectors for words - for example, cosine similarity between this vectors is large for similar words and small for not similar (the same is true for PMI matrix). But multiplication by arbitrary matrix doesn't preserve this property in general.

The question is why from all possible factorizations, word2vec chooses one from the small class where cosine similarity of rows of W is similar to cosine similarity of rows of (shifted) PMI matrix?

- A neural helmet to record with a decent precision the electromagnetic field that my brain generates

- A GoPro camera

The data I have after doing so are images associated with a representation of the state of my brain when I'm approximately seeing this image.

Then I design an NN that takes as input the state of my brain, and as output the image supposedly corresponding. And I run it.

And that's it. If everything goes well, I can now have a film of what I am currently seeing just from the record from the neural helmet. And with some random luck, I can also record and replay the images out my dreams...

This is done with OpenCV (actually, JavaCV which is the java native binding to OpenCV).

Now, I'm trying to find each of the groups of four questions, and I thought the best way to do that would be to perform basic machine learning (clustering) on the centers of the circles (instead of involving any more computer vision stuff).

https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/ml.html

I'm using this library for my clustering math (because I'm awful at math) and I cannot get any productive results out of any of the methods.

What would be an appropriate method of finding the groups of four bubbles, given the center of every bubble in the image? Note, that I wanted to make it so that the bubbles could be along the Y axis, which would make a clustering algorithm likely the best choice)

A 45 second sample from the song is overlappingly sliced into 2000 samples and then FFT'ed (essentially STFT without window), and use the frequency phase and magnitude as input. This means we have K * 2000 dimension data, where K = N/2000*L (N is the total number of samples, and L is overlap size). Then a 14 layer Denoising Autoencoder is trained with softplus activation for the encoder layers and linear activation for the decoder layers. Each Autoencoder layer reduces the dimension by 200, which means the resulting encoded data has ~600 dimension. I then train the LSTM model with non-overlapping (i.e. discarding data points that overlap with others) encoded data (refer to Aran Nayebi and Matt Vitelli LSTM model for training and generation https://github.com/MattVitelli/GRUV). To generate new data, I feed the encoded data into the LSTM, save the last predicted data, pad the new data onto the data point and remove the first data point, and feed it back to the model and repeat. After LSTM is done generating the new data, I feed that data onto the Autoencoder decoder layers.

Results:

Generative model with LSTM sequence length of 75 (This generation might have been overfitted?):

Generative model with LSTM sequence length of 150:

Generative model with FFT Autoencoder (i.e. non-overlapping), LSTM sequence length of 150:

https://youtu.be/0_l00Z5xXeo


(If you really think about it, it actually make sense why it's better to do STFT: the more samples the decoder has, the more variety the LSTM can produce and be decoded properly. However, if the overlapping size is too big, the Autoencoder's lower bound loss would also increase, decreasing the end fidelity of the music).


It should be pointed out that this is still far from perfect. The reason why the sample dimension is soo small is because i'm using a consumer level GPU (geForce 750 Ti 2GB). However, I was able to shorten the training time significantly by using Autoencoder. Also, Autoencoder reduces overfitting (I think?). Another problem is the clicking noise that arises from STFT process. I tried windowing the STFT function but it significantly impairs Autoencoder's reconstruction process.

a) Has any one tried something like this. I could not find some prior work on google scholar. To be honest, I have spent only few hours with limited combinations of the keywords.

b) How do I ensure that the learnt features capture the relevant information to differentiate based on shapes.

c) If this setup looks like working, I am going to use it on different set of images, each set having some different number of 'clusters'..e.g. (apples, oranges), (shirt, pants, shoes).

That there's some kind of ""sweet spot"" given the training techniques and kinds of architectures we know now that accomplishes the most for the given number of parameters.

About 25-40% of the training words classes is O, thus receiving the same int32 class number 126.

The words go through a context window method, in order to increase the number of features, and be influenced by the neighboring words.

After that, the words(with their context window) go through a word embedding process, before being fed to the model.

At the first training words, my model classify the words with different classes, then it starts classifying a lot of words with the same class:

It looks as a hyper-paramether configuration problem, but I don't have a clue of how to fix it. I've tried grad_clipping, increasing units on the lstm layer, adding a second layer, learning_rate and momentum, but the results are the same. Can someone give me a hint? Thank you.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Here's a hypothetical scenario: suppose you are trying to predict the winner of NFL games.

So lately, I've been trying to write the next sentence given the previous sentence using seq2seq.

I was using my validation loss to compare models, but I realize that this probably not a good way, especially if you're using different optimizers, so I thought I'd ask you guys:

**In Text Generation, what is the best way to measure your error?**

Here are a few ideas I had:

1. Use Google's Doc2Vec to Vectorize your output sentence. You then compare your generated sentence's vector with the target sentence's vector. Your aim is to minimize the cosine distance between the two. (Do a Root Mean Square)

2. Compare the percentage of words that similar between target sentence and generated sentence. 

3. I've been doing some reading about adversarial models, but I'm not quite sure how they would fit in here.

I have a dataset of book reviews. These books can be tagged with any number of qualifiers from a set of about 1600. The people reviewing these books can also tag themselves with these qualifiers to indicate that they like to read things with that tag. 

The dataset has a column for each qualifier. For every review, if a given qualifier is used to tag both the book and the reviewer a value of 1 is recorded. If there is not a ""match"" for a given qualifier on a given review, a value of 0 is recorded. 

There is also a ""Score"" column, which holds an integer 1-5 for each review (the ""star rating"" of that review). My goal is to determine what features are most important to getting a high score.

- Conv (32-&gt;64, (4,4)), Maxpooling (2,2)
- Conv (64-&gt;32, (4,4)), Upsampling (2,2)

With the mentioned two layered structure, the values are growing and growing, the last layer quickly has values &lt; -1000 after a few iterations, thus the reconstructed images are just black. Has anyone made experience with ConvAEs?

A more general question: When feature maps are created using the input image, the kernel slides across the image and creates its feature map.

I think what is going on is that the network is only seeing ""galaxy"", and then predicting ""in"" then ""the"" then ""galaxy""

This has led me to this idea: Using both the *mean* of the hidden states **and** the last hidden state:

 	#decoder_states refers to previous states produced by the encoder AND decoder. 
    mean_decoder_states = np.mean(decoder_states)
  	final_decoder_state = (0.5*decoder_states[-1])+0.5*mean_decoder_states

Where half of the state reflects the last hidden state and the other half represents what has already been said. This seems too obvious that no one has reported on it, so I'm thinking there must be a problem with this idea. I should clarify: that this combined mean and last hidden state average would be for **both training and testing**

Thoughts? Thanks! Open to any ideas.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

I think we should not promote the idea that ML is really hard core science stuff only. Well, it is, but there is so much more there. IMO this could slow down the development of the field in a long term.

We are building a platform where you can upload and showcase your trained Machine Learning models.


The idea is that you can focus on the Machine Learning algorithms and easily deploy your models without the need of coding UIs, configuring servers, etc.


It is an early prototype and for now it works only with Python code. Here you can play with two classic examples based on scikit-learn (it may take a couple of seconds to load the models):

[https://predictors.ai/#/p/Sales_demo_predictor_probabilities](https://predictors.ai/#/p/Sales_demo_predictor_probabilities)

[https://predictors.ai/#/p/Iris_flower_classifier](https://predictors.ai/#/p/Iris_flower_classifier)


And these are two more recent examples based on Keras and Lasagne:

[https://predictors.ai/index.html#/p/bAbI_size_reasoning_predictor](https://predictors.ai/index.html#/p/bAbI_size_reasoning_predictor)

[https://predictors.ai/#/p/Image_Labeler_VGG_S](https://predictors.ai/#/p/Image_Labeler_VGG_S)


In order to upload a model to the platform you just have to implement an additional method in your code and describe the model with a json file.


Public predictors are hosted for free. You can even deploy a model directly from GitHub and a link to its source code will be displayed. This is a very convenient way of sharing both the source code and an interactive demo of the model, and it also enables people to easily fork existing online models.


We have a long To-Do list full of improvements and new features, but if anyone would like to start uploading models to this beta version and get a profile on the website, send me a PM or an email and we will gladly grant you access.",3,20,False,self,,,,,

I have a question regarding decision trees. 

I have a dataset of 477 people with several features. Each person is either classified Class A or Class B, which is known.

Unfortunately only 55 out of those 477 are classified as class B.

I used the tree package of R to create a decision tree, to predict the Class of people via their feature vector.
In this application it is way more expensive if a Class B person is misclassified. Misclassifying Class A people is cheap.

The problem is, that the decision tree classifies Class A with high accuracy and Class B with low accuracy. Because the majority of the dataset is class A, the overall accuracy is high, but the result is not very useful.

Is there a way to include a cost function into the optimization algorithm of the decision tree, so it focuses more on classifying Class B correctly (while being overall less accurate)?

Thank you very much for your help.

For a character model the sentence ""a cat jumps"" might be broken up like this, if the number of steps before clipping is 3:

[(""a c"", "" ca""), (""at "", ""t j""), (""jum"", ""ump"") ...]

I think that batches consist of different phrases or sentences whose character sequences are independent of one another.

However, there are two things I don't understand about this approach.

- What happens when different batches have different lengths?

- Won't this training strategy miss out on learning the dependencies between character pairs that happen to fall on the border between segments?

1) Does selection always occur after evaluating fitness regardless whether phase transition happens? Also, would the selection methods be the same (ie the selected individual [a b c] becomes the new population [a a b b c c]?

2) Does the mutation method allow the same rotation to be picked more than once?

3) In the diagram, what does ""phase i &gt; 0"" or ""phase i = 0"" mean? Shouldn't the only thing that determines phase transition be x &gt; u?

4) Going from G2 to G3, what actually occurs? What does ""putting edges in orbit"", ""adjacent corners in a circuit"" and ""(x) number of wrong colored facelets"" mean?

I'm using the WEKA GUI to do some text classification. I'm not that experienced with Machine Learning, but I understand it at a high level. 

Right now I'm testing a set of attributes for binary classification of text. I want to add another attribute, specifically mean word concreteness, to the classifier. How do I go about doing this, preferably through the GUI?

If I can't do it through the GUI then:

Can I convert the ARFF to a CSV file, write the values onto another column in the CSV file, re-convert to ARFF and run the classifier with a new column of attributes?

Or do I need to write Java code to add an attribute? Can I add just concreteness or would I have to write code for all of the attributes I'm interested in? How would I go about programming a script to do this?

Is there any change that I need to make to the actual classifier?

i'm relative new to that field and my questions is maybe not that smart but i want to make sure I'm correct here.

If I have two lists for example:

List 1: 
Name, age, gender, destination

List 2: 
Destination, distance to destination (from us)

To get better results i want to integrated the list2 in list1 so i have
Name, age, gender, destination, distance

Thats for my train set.
In my test set i can't do that because i want to predict the destination. 
My test set would only be Name, age, gender,

Should the results be better if i add the informations from the second list to my train set? So the system learns that a 85 years old male don't travel to Germany because its too faraway.
And then in the test set the systems don't predict Germany because the user is 85 years old and male.
Is that the correct way?

Sometimes people identify scalable with fast (as in ""you can scale up easily, without compromising efficiency"") and point to languages that allow you a strict control of the memory (such as C++) and a programming style that focus on efficiency (such as templates). Other times I see scalable referred on the context of a single-machine, as scaling to multiple cores. All this claims are relevant, but what I am actually looking for are libraries that can scale horizontally at machine level; i.e.: to a cluster. I believe that after ""exhausting the other artefacts"" - efficient programming style and appropriated use of machine cores - this would be the ultimate path.
IMHO, to go this path you need to implement or rely on a third-party file management system; this is because if you are going to care about distributed analysis, the chances are you have a lot of data and you also want to have distributed storage (and storage management).

I want to try and use the data to answer interesting questions things such as determining developer skill. I can get the data into any layout and I have been playing with R, weka and excel to try and get meaningful answers to my questions but have had not a lot of luck.

For example one thing I am trying to learn is if the number of times a developer comments on other developers reviews is and indicator of their skill. My thought is that a more skilled developer would comment more on his peers reviews. To show if a developer has higher skill I think their reviews would have less iterations, generate less comments from others among other things.

Where do I start? What I've done is queried the data in SQL server into csv files. For example I made a file that has two columns. Column one is the amount of comments the developer comments on others and column two is how many times a others comment on that developers review. When I put it in a scatter plot all I see is the data mind of smooshed together. I think the reason is that many reviews are for massive uptake type code changes which do not get many comments. I am not sure what the best way to trim the data is. Is there any specific types of data mining algorithms that I should learn to answer these types of questions?

Here is example backward pass from ""learning to execute"":
 
    for i = params.seq_length, 1, -1 do
        state.pos = state.pos - 1
        local tmp = model.rnns[i]:backward({state.data.x[state.pos],     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; rnns[i] are clones of same LSTM

        copy_table(model.ds, tmp)

As I understand forward pass through the network doesn't change anything in it and backward pass only accumulates gradInput values in each node.
Since all params and gradParams are shared across clones it seems having multiple RNNs to be an overkill.

I have a bunch of jpg images with RGB channels and fixed resolution along with a csv file of labels. 


My problem is that there are many tutorials about how to model and run a network on TensorFlow but there are very little information about how to prepare data which can be plugged into the input of the network to train it. All they have is a MNIST database and CIFAR10 for CNN. In both cases, in tutorials they just import pre-processed data into Python using import at the start. I tried to learn from [cifar10.py](https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10.py) and [cifar10_input.py](https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py) and what I have learned so far is that there are binary files provided in batches and cifar10_input.py slices that data into batches and returns dataset which is suitable for the network. [This](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) page has details about internal structure of those binary files but converting jpg images and labels to that format is a daunting task for a newcomer.


I have tried to Google it but I couldn't find much about this topic. Is there any script that I can use to prepare such type of datasets from images and labels file? If not then is there any tutorial which explains these things step by step?

I've been working on trying to implement an algorithm to find grasping points for a robotic arm and I have some questions. I won't ask you to solve the problem for me as my goal is to learn, but I would definitely appreciate if you could set me on the right track! Please keep in mind that I have never really done any computer vision at all (Only in my 2nd year of uni) and I have only been programming for a bit more than a year now.


In this article about finding grasp points for a robotic arm: http://www-cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/icra2010-LeKammKaraNg.pdf


From what I understand, they find the grasp points by finding the gradients at different points and then checking if the vector from a point to the other forms a lign with the gradients. What I'm not sure I understand: - In part III (and briefly V.B), they mention that they used SVM to classify good grasps vs bad grasps. However, they also say that their algorithm can be used on new, unknown objects. How exactly is that possible with SVM? My guess is that the SVM only checks the gradients/angle of the vector between points when it is trying to classify the grasps? If I wanted to implement such a SVM, would I need different images for my learning set or would a single image with multiple grasp points be enough? Also, what kind of object should I be using? A block, a cup, etc?


My second question(quick question):
I'm not sure I understand how to select contact points for the calculation of the gradients (parc IV - A)(They say they compute 10x0 patches around the contact points. Do they simply take every point that corresponds to an edge on the image and use it as a contact point? I feel like doing this could create a lot of error?

Missing the right dataset is often what stops me from continuing with my machine learning ideas. I suspect other data scientist/hobbyists have felt this pain too. The raw data is out there somewhere, and in some cases it might also exist as a clean dataset. It's just out of reach.

SOLUTION:

So what if there was an open source platform where you could easily share and request datasets? Perhaps even pay people to gather the data you want.
This should be a site that is fun to browse through. And it should be extremely easy to view all available datasets in your domain of interest. Over time it could contain all the worlds publicly available datasets.

NEXT STEP:

So I've built a tiny MVP in order to see try and confirm my hypothesis, and now I'd like people to test it.

For a vanilla RNN of M = 128, N = 1024 and T = 1024 (RNNs with attention, LSTMs and uRNNs can easily model dependencies this long) with no inputs and using fp32, hidden state alone occupies 0.5 GB. Taking account into input state, RNN stacking and more complex modules like LSTM/GRU, this number could easily blow up to be several times bigger than that to the point GPU memory becomes a limiting factor when training RNNs.

Here's how storing RNN hidden states in the main memory works. In the forward pass, RNN states are computed and subsequently transferred D2H to the main memory via PCIe [in an overlapping manner](http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/how-overlap-data-transfers-cuda-cc/), while in the mirrored backward pass, RNN states are transferred H2D and used to propagate error backwards and update weights. The only things GPU stores consistently throughout the training process are the weight matrices, which are in the manageable order of O(N\^2).

This would only work efficiently if the computation on the GPU is not much faster than the data transfer. Here in a ballpark estimate we assume we have a Titan X operating at 1250 MHz under GPU boost. It would reach a theoretical peak speed of 3072 cores * 1250 MHz * 2 ops/FMA = 7.68 TFLOPS which is a very generous estimate considering [you'll need Nervana's GEMM to get a performance even close to that](http://svail.github.io/). With the above vanilla RNN example, computing one timestep on one minibatch requires 2 * N * N * M = 268.4 Mops and it will take 0.03495 ms to do so ignoring all copy costs and overhead. Assuming a measured-by-myself 11 GB/s transfer rate over PCIe 3.0 x16 with pinned host memory (theoretical peak is 16 GB/s), transferring one timestep minibatch worth of hidden state vector of size N * M * 4 bytes = 524.3 kB takes 0.04439 ms which would allow the GPU to work at an efficiency of 78%! In reality transferring such small amount of data will incur heavy overhead, but you can batch together several timesteps to alleviate that.

Of course, when you use LSTM/GRU and factor in input etc. things get much more complicated, but there's one crucial thing we can take away from this: computation cost grows quadratically w.r.t. N, while transfer cost only grows linearly. This mean we would actually BENEFIT from choosing a larger hidden state if we put RNN states in the main memory. Again with the above example, assuming we now transfer over PCIe 3.0 x8, we would only need a hidden state size of 2602 (for a computationally ""round"" number, use 2560) for the transfer speed to break even with the computation speed.",11,23,False,self,,,,,

But there's one thing I don't see that's really being covered (or i'm just not looking at the right places). How do you actually give an unlabeled image to your model to give you the probability what it is.
For example I'm doing the tutorials on Tensorflow, I'm now working with Convolutional Neural Networks tutorial. Teaching the model the mnist dataset. But how can I take a picture of a number and give it to the model so it can give me the probability of what that number could be. I can't find any code examples do this. Could you guys point me in the right direction?",5,0,False,self,,,,,
