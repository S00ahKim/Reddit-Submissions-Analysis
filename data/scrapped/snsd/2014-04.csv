I got tired of my old SNSD chrome theme and I'm to old to be using all of the pink ones that are on the chrome store so I went ahead and made my own based off their Baby - G campaign.  It is mostly just a picture that I added a filter too and it has tabs that match the theme of the photoshoot but I like it because it is simple and clean.


I hope you all will like it as well.  [Here is the link.](https://www.mychrometheme.com/t/37dt8nta7nxhnkzce6rusz34j) I hope you all will enjoy it as much as I do.

I'm a 26 year old white male. I've never posted before but I check news and this site almost daily so I really feel Im one of you. While I don't buy into a lot of the sappy and touchy feely views of love and ownership of ""our girls"" as some of the posts I see on here. I cant resist Girls Generations charms and I've liked them since the end of 2011 when I found them online.

I feel compelled to write something on the current events. I hope I make something worth reading and thought provoking.

Since Mr Mr late release there is a lot of negative press. The issues of being old at the ripe age of 25 and the group coming to an end. These issues dont really make sense to me upon the release of a new album. A new album says new material, new content, and new fresh SNSD market. It says the girls are working and have no plans of going anywhere. They flat out say it all the time we want to continue with this for years. But the shows and the promotions their on push for the issues of an end to their group and being old.
 
The scripts of these shows force these conversations. I dont know about any of you but I did not enjoy the healing camp show. It told me for certain that these companies will LITERALLY sell the tears of these girls till their bodies and minds are dried up and of no more use.

You can trace these seeds of destruction back to when Yoona and Sooyoung revealed their boyfriends. But thatll lead into a whole different discussion of cultural differences and is it ok to have a boyfriend in the public eye.
 
(it seems like Jessica and Tiffany are holding up much better in these recent events. Less tears then the others and in Tiffanys interview here was decent. http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/19372/1/girls-generations-k-pop-reign .  Its one of the last questions about relationships)

Which was a hell of a lot better than letting Yuri walk into the social trap and speak for the whole group. Telling people youre nervous about a breakup and not knowing what to do with yourself lately, is just not tactful. I swear she trys to be honest and innocent telling it like it is but she didn't know what she was doing. They have to talk beforehand about what issues not to surrender to and think before you speak. (please dont hate me yuri I love ur butt)

ANYWAY the main news that pushed me over the edge and post about is this hyoyeon debacle. The worst part about this is we never have any hardcore facts. Always with the vague headlines and explanations that dont hold water. But never anything before like this where its a disturbance with police involved. 

This story has been changing in several ways since the news broke on april 1st.  The main details are Hyoyeon is alone with a 35 year old man in his home or apartment. The time was around or after midnight. They had a scuffle or fight. A misunderstanding of some sort. There is consistent mention of hyoyeon making some attempt to jump out of the 2nd floor as this misunderstanding took place.

The police got involved when the man reported hyoyeon for an alleged assault. Some sort of punch to the eye. No visible harm to his body. This man fought with a 90lb petite Asian girl. I cant imagine anyone from any society reading about this story and not immediately think that this man is, for lack of a better word, a pussy.

But besides him being a weak man AND being able to suspiciously remain anonymous. The man dropped the alleged assault charge on a change of heart"" and left hyoyeon as an alleged culprit in the public view. Nevermind the trying to jump off a balcony and how hyoyeon could be a victum in all of this. SM has spoken out on this with the same excuse as always it was a misunderstanding. Nothing bad going on here. Nothing to worry about. Go back to your business people.

The cold hard facts to this incident exist whether we learn them or not. Whether it is good news or bad news or whether people are ready to hear it or not. It is what is. But as news on the internet, its just going to fizzle out as bad press and work against SNSD just as well as the unfounded claims I talked about earlier. 

 
This next part is dangerous but I want to share what I think people should at least consider when they see a headline like this. I just dont see it crossing peoples minds when they talk about the feeble info were given.
 
A 35 year old man with a young pop star in his home. Headlines on many sites actually say the same things. That they were playing together, or having fun or whatever. In the adult world playing together doesnt mean they were having a sleepover like kids where you play Mario kart or truth or dare all night. The whole entertainment industry is guilty of all types of the things you've heard of and more you haven't. 

Maybe it really was just a little scuffle and the man is just a pussy. Maybe hyoyeon had an outburst. Maybe hyoyeon denied him sex. MAYBE this anonymous pussy of awesome connections got denied his fetish of sexually dominating a famous popstar, and decided to teach her a lesson by having a rough scuffle, LOSE, then call the cops and!, successfully have hyoyeon taken and questioned like a criminal while he has nothing done to his name or like. As if to say to her ""you do what i say, no one will help you not even the police.""

I think thats a nice worst case scenario that didn't happen. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst.

As i reread this I glazed over a butt load of issues. But if you read the whole thing. Thank you for your time. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

From my experiences, Vancouver doesn't really have a large K-pop fanbase. I don't know anyone else who knows about SNSD, but I secretly LOVE SNSD. I've watched every single music video countless times, go to this sub reddit every day, and sometimes skip parties to watch Inkigayo or Show! Music Core. I'm in my high school years and I have a great group of friends, but none of them know of my obsession with SNSD and i'm not going to tell them about it anytime soon. I feel embarrassed to talk about SNSD to anyone. I feel that if I do, they won't want to hang out with me anymore. They'll just make fun of me. I've tried introducing k-pop and SNSD to one of my best friends. He called me ""gay"" and ""weird"" and from that day on, SNSD is just something I've kept to myself (hence the reason im using a throwaway). I love their music, personalities and of course their gorgeous looks and I don't see anything ""gay"" in liking them. I really do hope some of you SONEs understand me. Thanks

TL;DR: None of my friends know about my secret obsession with SNSD.

EDIT: Wow. Did not expect this type of response, I generally don't get a lot of responses on my posts. Thanks for your help! Reading other people's experiences didn't make me feel alone anymore. For all of those wondering, I attend Kitsilano Secondary School, which is located in Vancouver's West Side. Also, I am the only asian guy among my friend group (the rest are all white), so maybe thats why I feel so lonely. Only one of them know of my obsession but I'm sure hes told my other friends... I just hope they can accept the fact that I like k-pop and SNSD soon. As one of you mentioned, its terrible having no one to talk to about SNSD.",73,40,False,self,,,,,

I live in a smallish city in Sweden and have been listening to SNSD/Kpop since 2009. Today is the first time i've heard kpop out in the wild with the exception for Psy and short news segments covering south korea.

I was doing some shopping at H&amp;M while they played the same top40 tracks you constantly hear on the radio day in and day out. While I walked to the register with my stuff I froze and my hearing got my undivided attention when I heard an awfully similar voice saying ""Let's Go"". Took me a few seconds to realize it was actually MR.MR. being played in a sizable store that was crowded. After my purchase was done I just stood around near the exit with my phone in my hand essentially doing nothing.

Somehow it felt incredibly consoling that there are others like me that are into kpop in a place where you can hardly expect it. None of my current friends knows about my kpop obsession and I never felt comfortable bringing it up since I know it just leads to so many dumb questions and looks. Nonetheless simply hearing 4min of SNSD being played in a store made me slightly happier for a few hours.

[This is the Tribute video made for Sooyoung](https://vimeo.com/90981858) and [this one is the video made for Raising the Sun(ny) video](https://vimeo.com/91156110) for those of you who missed it. The links were taken down temporarily in an attempt to upload the other videos made (of the other members)

The short movies are a work in progress and will be developed over time. 

What are the changes to expect?

* I'll be including other videos that weren't available to me in the first draft. (recent addition was Genie - Japanese Version, Seoul collaboration, and a few others).
* Future uploads may either be on Youtube (if I find a guy who can mix music) or on another alternative that has more space for video uploads and a 720p (HD) function.
* The limitations of vimeo's video space prevents me from uploading more videos so i'll probably leave this as is. It all depends. (I don't want to pay for their premium package if I don't have to.)

To those who may want to help: The future projects requires 2 main things

* Someone who can remix / modify songs (to avoid the copyright trap in youtube) based on a list i'll be providing or user suggestions.
* Someone who can link me 720p videos of SNSD that they want added. 720p is the best decent sized video on full screen that can be modified without quality loss.
 
I can do the rest from there. 

Why do those things help? 

* I'm not always on top of the latest releases of their videos. 
* I don't always have the time / skills to the music for the videos. 
* I'm more focused on the cutting of the videos rather than creating music, so I'll work around your work... it's a collaboration. 

Lastly, I can't commit a time for any other uploads because I can't set aside a time to do this at a fixed rate. You guys can reach me if you have questions or suggestions here. Your feedback helps.

I'm open to suggestions and possibly using videos beyond their official videos (links for 720p version would be needed). I'd love to hear from you.

I'll go first.

My bias is taeyeon and I was was so disgusted when she simply did a cover of justin bieber for her first youtube vid. And through that found out that years before she wanted to collab with him and prolly still does to this day. After all the great short haired mature looks that attracted me to her, and her kavorka personality, I couldn't help but feel she was just another stupid little girl with this info. Its the only type of girl that goes for that. I reasoned through it a bit with ""she like so many other asians in different countries who might see white people and think they all look the same, just doesn't know him like we do. I would of rather learned the identity of her secret korean boyfriend. I was so disgusted with it but decided not to hold one thing against her. I feel it tells me more then I need to know to get the hell out but i'm staying deluded. (And if that hipster doofus heechul with gay flair really is her partner at the moment. This is just fucking tragic.)

I want back and watched all of the live debut/comeback performances of new songs SNSD released through the years and noticed that their dancing was flawless. It was so sharp, fluid, and in sync.

When I go and watch their concert tours or some other performances of their songs on YouTube after their debut/comeback, I notice they aren't as sharp as they used to be. It looks like they're going through the motions and using a little bit less energy than when they first performed the new song.

I'll use performances of ""Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)"" as an example.

Vid # 1 - July 17th 2009: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKeR-5iSrvE

This first video is a performance of the song a month or so after promotion started. Promotion for the song lasted through August 2009.

Vid # 2 - January 12th 2014: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODQegC5Aj5U

This second video is a performance of the song in January of 2014 on a show called Monster.

Faults and flaws as people.

......Does not compute yet?

I'm a little irritated with certain responses to some posts i've tried, so i'm making a topic for discussion. We're not here for simply their music or their dancing skills. We're here because we're intrigued with these people (for whatever reason).

I enjoy reading other peoples opinions even if their not exactly like mine because it gives me a different perspective on things. Things I may have been previously incorrect about or I just learn something new.

When it comes to public figures. Certain things are up for discussion. So if I say Prince seems like an ugly dog I call tiffanys taste in things into question. Or Yuri doesn't answer questions that well on talk shows and they need to work with her. It doesn't have to be seen as an end thought where you flame in defense of your goddess. It could lead into ""yea they should teach her to say this maybe. that would be suited to her strengths.""

Aside from those notes. The Challenge is set. Can you name faults? And do others see it the same way? Is it right or wrong? Or maybe your just seeing things that aren't there. Good Luck. Thank you. (Try to have fun with it)",44,0,False,self,,,,,

It's basically pics with 9 members' eyes or tummies, I haven't tried too hard yet myself but it looks like fun. 

If anything I find it easier to remember which pic they came from rather than the details about their eyes etc. but take a look yourself, and post your guesses in the comments below, I don't know the answers myself so I won't be able to help with that, but I think some of the veterans here will definitely get them all easily, and the consensus will probably be correct, have fun! :)

Compared to last year (1072 participants), we got 1005 participants this year.

**Click the blue links to see the results.**

###Gender - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/DwZ7DRJ.png)

Pretty much the same as the last 2 years, mainly dudes up in here.

###Age - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/qov3Vb7.png)

Most of us are between the ages 20 - 25 and what I found most interesting is that we have some 40+ people in here, 8 in fact! And nobody under the age of 10 years old, which is good because they shouldn't be on reddit anyway lol.

###Race / Ethnicity - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/CV96Mvw.png)

Quite of a few of you pointed out that I should add a multiracial option for this year's census. I'm glad you guys did because there are quite a few of you :D

###Location - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/MXJGpOE.png)

USA! USA! USA!

###Favorite Member - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/FaGSMLw.png)

Resident queen of /r/SNSD, Kim Taeyeon continues her winning streak. We've done 3 census and Taeyeon has come on top of each one. Similar results to last year BUT, Jessica barges her way into the top 3 and managed to tie with Sunny for second place (Sica was 4th place last year). And Tiffany rounds out the top 3 at 3rd place. Yuri finishes as the member with the least amount of votes :( 

---

###Favorite Promoted Korean Song - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/s8HXwhg.png)

Genie once again gets first place. Mr. Mr. gets a surprising 3rd place, it seems more recent songs gets ranked up there (last year, I got a boy got into the top 3 as well).

###Favorite Promoted Japanese Song - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/dUGZmmw.png)

MR TAXI TAXI TAXI TAXI

###How long have you been a SONE? - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/RNfkEnq.png)

A lot of our users have become fans in the last 3 years and 30 of you have OG status, fans since the beginning!

###How did you discover the girls? - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/10Okrcm.png)

YouTube has been a great way of introduction to SNSD.

###Have you seen them live? - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/iazvZj1.png)

A lot of you chose other, I'm really curious as to what 'other' is in terms of seeing the girls live.

###SNSD Merchandise - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/VamQhGY.png)

###Couple Questions - [Results](http://i.imgur.com/4tnQv5S.png)

I hope you guys knew that the 'WHHYYYY' option was a joke lol. Still funny that most of you chose that option.

My bias has always been Sunny. My eyes were drawn to her in Gee (my introduction to SNSD and k-pop) for reasons that I probably don't need to say.

When I first saw Gee I remember wondering why Hyoyeon was in the group. She didn't really sing all that much and I knew her as ""that chick who just puts her hand up to her face a lot"". Now, she is one of my favourites, some of the best scenes in any of the shows I've seen of the girls are when Hyo gets to say whatever she wants, its always entertaining (I'm thinking of GGTS episode 6 or 7 specifically when she introduces herself as the ""cutie of SNSD"" or something and the face[s] she makes is hilarious).

I've had my screensaver for a while so I decided to reupload it in case anyone wanted it :)

All you need to do is download the file, open it, and press enter. For Window users, just go to Personalize, Screen Saver and you should look for ""Daum Screensaver_High"".

These screen savers were released late 2010 if I recall correctly, so yeah, they're old, but nevertheless pretty neat. Just a tip, while the screen saver is running, press escape to close the screen saver and you can move your mouse to see more clips of the members :)

After the queer thread last week, /u/sundaddy and I were inspired to create a subreddit welcoming to the queer -- queer being gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and various gender/sexual identity -- fans of SNSD. And yknow, all those who enjoy the Soshi shipping, the suited Soshi and all the So Gay Shi Dae in all its glory.   

We hope that this subreddit will be a discussion-, sharing- and frivolity-oriented off-shoot of the /r/SNSD we know and love. 

We are hoping to go by a weekly schedule, where each day will have a specific theme to participate in. 

We'll be kicking off with a welcome thread for new members to discuss what they want out of the subreddit and introduce themselves. All are welcome to /r/SNSDqueers and we hope to see some of /r/SNSD there!

I just wanted to repost a thought i had to sum up what that issue meant. Theres too many comments now to get a clear view of what happened. So....here.

My ultimate view is that this is necessary and has a point to it. And I would hope to see everyone posting in the same sub without fear of judgment or persecution.

I hear views of ""tolerance"" and ""love for my fellow sone"". But if queers were comfortable posting here they wouldn't of made a different sub.

If you don't care what other views people might have and openly shun them then you deserve your own sub. If you want a sub for all fans everywhere then you need to respect all posts.

This is a sub for fans everywhere so it demands respect for posts. ",20,0,False,self,,,,,

The competition features 128 songs, mostly all OT9 songs, with some solo OSTs, and all of the TTS songs. Matchups were determined by using a randomizer.

[Round 1 Voting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LGSNb8kt5k0izuRQo2O0UrE-xsg9Hhyp0ewwHofCk60/viewform?usp=send_form) 

Open until 4/28/13 at 3PM EST. This gives everyone 2 days to vote for this round. It would be preferred if you select a winner for all the matchups, but is not required, considering how there are 64 matchups. 

Thanks everyone and may the best song win!

I need help finding a certain gif of snsd. I just can't remember the right keywords for a search.

Its a gif where they advertise skin care products or something. Their all dressed like rich NYC penthouse wives all in white.. And their sitting on a couch. They have a tanned skin sorta look. Another hint is I think its the one where sooyoung says hyoyeon looks like olive from popeye. (which doesn't do her justice its actually her best look.)

The main thing about it is where tiffany takes sunnys hand and puts it on her leg. And to the right hyoyeon sees this and goes straight face like ""ugh"".

Again I can't remember names of products or anything for a search. If you can remember what this is and find it. You will obtain the rank of SUPER SONE!

Good luck. Thank you.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I had some free time lately and I thought about starting a project to help newbies or people just getting into SNSD to learn more about the group and the members. I think there's a great community here and if we put all of our ideas together we could make something really great and useful. 

I was going to create a video focusing on Taeyeon first, because she is the oldest member, and the leader. The aim of the video is to help people recognise and get to know Taeyeon - so for example if new fans are trying to learn which member is which, they could use the video as a starting point. 

The video will ideally be short so it isn't too much effort to watch, but I want to cram a lot of stuff in the video so it will be really memorable. Looking back, when I was first getting to know the members, there were certain things that really helped in learning who is who, for example Tiffany's eye smile, Sooyoung's long legs, Yuri's quirky personality. 

So I ask you - what is for favourite thing about Taeyeon? What is your favourite clip, picture, or whatever, that really made her stand out to you, or made you fall in love with her? It could be you favourite vocal performance of hers, your favourite funny video, variety clip, photoshoot, or anything really - I'm open to all ideas!

I'd also really appreciate it if you could share any thoughts or ideas you have on the project :)

Usually the forum discussions on Soshified never really intrigue me unless they have information about tour dates, comeback performances, etc. But recently, I received an email about quite an interesting disussion that I know all of you will be somewhat interested in. The discussion was from an article that you may read [right here.](http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/88190/20140419/korean-music-industry-insiders-suggest-the-reign-of-girls-generation-may-soon-be-over.htm) 

Sorry if this article is a bit long but, for some reason, it grabbed my interest.  However, if you're not interested reading the article, I will make this question short and sweet: Is it almost the end for SNSD? This article talks about the relationships that Yoona, Sooyoung, and Tiffany had just been involved in and about SM Entertainment's ""leniency"" on their dating lives. 

Please feel free to leave any opinions you have about the subject (whether they are good or bad). I would love to hear what you guys have to say about the question all SONES seem to avoid.",5,0,False,default,,,,,
