I was bored one day, just browsing the youtube front pages of the different countries when all of a sudden *BAM!* GEE GEE GEE GEE BABY BABY came blearing through my headphones, i have a habit of skipping straight to the middle of most videos. So i started it again from the beginning and at first i was like mannequins...? wtf, after watching about 60 seconds i closed the video, but it was too late. For the next hour or so all i could hear in my head was GEE GEE GEE GEE BABY BABY... nothing could get my brain to stop repeating those words. So i relented and went back to the video.

After i watched it all the way through i knew i had to have more, so i looked. I found Oh.. then i found Genie and Run Devil Run.. For the next 6 months all i did was watch subbed Korean variety shows with the girls in it( all credit to Soshified, i must have downloaded EVERY SINGLE SHOW from their site).

After that i slowly started to realise there were other K-Pop groups, who would have thought huh :) and i got into running man, 2D1N, WGM, Strong Heart and the list goes on.

I will always be a SONE but i would like to thank them for introducing me to Korean music and culture on a broader level, so much so that ive started learning Korean and plan on going over next christmas.

So, where did it all begin for you?

Personally, I thought they nailed it with their best possible effort for their first major network debut in America. I'm in the UK and eager to see how SNSD perform in the Western music scene in large exposure, so I have to be optimistic about this incredibly venture for the K-Pop market.

I picked up on SNSD from a friend on the internet about a year or so ago, started with Genie and Gee, at first I found it a bit cringeworthy, but a month or so later I revisited it and found it to be incredibly catchy. I still don't know to this day whether I actually genuinely like the music, or whether it's that nine super-hot girls are dancing in perfect choreography that attracts me. I can say that I genuinely do like the songs though, as I've put a few of them on my iPod to listen to.

Anyway, the English mixed version of 'The Boys' they performed last night was definitely a good way to start into the US scene. I could say that earlier hits of theirs might have come across as a tad too over-hyped with oriental happiness, whereas the mainstream western artists seem to be into a grittier and darker sound and image, similar to The Boys image that the girls have adopted. On image, they nailed it, I don't think a mainstream US audience was expecting an asian band to be dressed in that particular attire, they might have expected something as seen in Etude, Kissing You or Gee (bright colours, cute hairstyles, etc.) and instantly blown it off as some super-cute asian thing that just isn't their thing.

Lately, the girls' image has been a lot more real, or at least, on a level with a global music scene that is interpreted as the norm. I don't think that the western audiences would be ready for full-blown K-Pop at this point, and that's not what 'The Boys' is, at least, that's not what the English mix was. However, I don't think it strayed too far from what the girls are known for pulling off, they've gone across a variety of styles and images and still today often sift between them, which is a good thing. However, this Westernised-version of 'The Boys' is a good entry for the Western market, and is tailor made for the appropriate audience to ease them into the K-Pop scene.

I know a lot of people may not be too pleased with the Girls' performance and it has received mixed-reviews from Western fans who are used to the typical uber-cutesy-aegyo stylings. But I think it was rather excellent overall. Top marks to the girls.

*Disclaimer: I am speaking as a relative outsider, I stopped listening for a few months a while back and picked back up at the release of Mr. Taxi, haven't exactly paid much attention to The Boys for some reason, I don't know why really. But eh, what I mean is as someone who first properly listened to The Boys in the form of this English version on Letterman, I'm thoroughly impressed and, were I a Western consumer, uneducated on the asian music scene, I would definitely want to check them out further.)*

And how I believe the style its media takes in its entertainment industries reflects something of a departure from standard asian themes and tropes.**

I'm one of those very aesthetically receptive people who responds well to all things that are in a certain style. Since discovering Girls Generation and South Korean culture, I've definitely found an appeal for the aesthetic of the country, separate from Japan's own aesthetic. This post is about just that.

I've been thinking about it lately. Watching old music numbers, live promotional videos, CF's and even the various variety shows and game shows that the girls have been a part of. What exactly is it that draws me back to this interesting groups of girls? Is it that I actually like the music? Is it the fact that having nine extremely attractive girls dancing in perfect choroegraphy is attractive? I think it's something else.

*Though I will offer a short disclaimer; I think their music is very good, and I think that they are definitely attractive girls.*

Firstly, what exactly is the aesthetic that I'm on about? I've always been interested in South East Asian cultures, and not just for the anime and manga, but for the history, religion, political interest and other factors. It just seems like an incredibly unique and versatile land, full of equally interesting cultures to someone from as generic a country as my own (the United Kingdom). Not to say Britain is dull and boring, but you get a lot of the same stuff in Western cultures, at least nothing that is as varied as what you get in the East.

I'm not anything near the level of your usual cosplayer or convention-goer, my room and my lifestyle shows very little evidence of my interest in the other cultures of the world, which is mainly due the monetary restraints, is also because I don't like broadcasting to everyone what I like, I guess that's just me. What I'm attempting to get across though, is that I'm not like your usual Japan-o-phile who glories themselves in all things Kawaii.

The aesthetic that I've received from South Korean media entertainment, however, is completely different to that of Japanese media entertainment. The styles are relatively different, and that reflects on the people, society and the aesthetic. Japan seems to me, to present itself as a far more clustered place, open to Westernisation and aware of it's place in the world as a foremost technological and media innovator. Whereas South Korea likes to keep to itself and within the asian market exclusively, why is this? I don't know. Perhaps it's just a tendency of South Korean businessmen to steer clear of the Western markets? Perhaps it's just some other restraint due to licensing? Whatever the reason, it seems to keep its media branches rather to itself, in contrast to Japan's far-reaching influence within Western culture and sub-culture.

I'm unsure of any other prominent Asian media influences, but South Korea and Japan seem to have the most dominant.

Maybe it's because South Korea is a smaller country, with a smaller population, and more traditional values about itself and its people (South Koreans are noted to be one of the least likely ethnicities to marry outside of their own ethnicity), but for some reason, I just like South Korea a lot more than Japan.

I can't believe it's taken me **this long** to get to the bloody point of this post. Oh lord, sorry for the rambling. Basically, the aesthetic I get from SNSD, South Korean media entertainment and all things SK-related in culture, are a very clean, modern, stylised and very minimalist aesthetic. It's a style that gels very well with me. Despite sprawling metropolis' and conglomerate businesses right in the heart of the capital, the country still seems to have an excellent quality of life, and retains a top standard of cleanliness and style within its city, and its citizens. Why? What makes this country stand out from others?

I wanted to write more on this, but I can't. I'm planning a trip to South Korea to visit Seoul later this year, where I'll probably expand on my thoughts and write something considerably longer that I'd intend to get published. I love cultural differences between Eastern and Western cultures, and I'd love to be able to write up some interesting experiences of an Englishman in Seoul, to take a tone from Sting right there.

If anyone else has any similar views on this, please post. I love discussing aesthetic and cultural stylings, and when they take a turn on modernism and being very stylish, it intrigues me, as I'd expect South East Asian cultures to retain their very colourful, hyperactive, cluttered approach, or to be very traditional and sombre. Whereas South Korea seems to have adopted a style that would be found in some of the classier areas of Parisian style.

A good example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrObY2mYJhk
Note how the video plays similar in style and editing, along with music, to something you'd expect to find in an advert for Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier or something similar.

Just got back home from possibly the best day of my life.  I have a lot of homework to catch up on, but I'll be answering questions throughout the night!!

RECAP:  So I arrived at Union Square at around 2AM.  When we got there there was already a line stretching around to the back of Best Buy.  My friends and I were freaking out as we went to the back of the line, wondering if we made the 300 person limit.  One of my friends went to count everyone, and reported back saying there were about 160 people in front of us.

So then we just waited in line and took turns going on bathroom breaks and food runs.  At around 6AM, we were starting to be let into the Best Buy and line up around the aisles there.  They only let 10 people in at a time, let them get settled, and sent in another 10 people, keeping count with every group.  I was let in at the 210-220 people mark.  Once inside, we sat down and tried to get as much rest as possible.

At 8AM, they started lining us up for the CDs and wristbands.  The wristbands was just one of those paper sticky wristbands with the logos of the record company and some other stuff on it.  Then we were free to leave until the event started at 6PM

When I returned to the store at 6, there were already hundreds of people lined up outside the store.  They closed the store off to everybody without a wristband.  I was near the end of the line, with about 10 people behind me.  A little past 7PM, I could hear screams from the other side of the store, and people started walking by with their signatures.  Everyone was asking them how it was like, what did they get signed, if they were all there.  Unfortunately Jessica could not make it to the event.  Most people were walking out of the store in tears or just freaking out in general.  It really hyped it up for everyone in line.

The line started moving closer and closer to the girls, and the guards there told everyone to put away their cameras.  We got close enough to hear the girls talking to other fans, and my friends and that's when my heart started pounding in anticipation.

The girls sat side by side on a long table with their manager people standing behind them.  Tiffany was the first to sign.  Then Hyoyeon, Sooyoung, Yoona, Seohyun, Sunny, Taeyeon, and then Yuri (I THINK this was the order...)  I was basically stunned the entire time they were signing my album...but still managed to shake all of their hands and thanking them for everything they do.

As I was being guided out by the staff, the staff members were asking everyone ""who got to touch them??""  I thought everyone was shaking their hands lol but I guess not many people did...  The workers all congratulated me with a high five.

Once outside, word got out that I managed to get TWO items signed, and also shake their hands, and a bunch of fans shook MY hand to associative-property-shake SNSDs hands.  Then I headed home and here I am AMAing!~~




PICTURES:  Unfortunately they didn't allow cameras around the girls, so no pics of them.  But here are some pics of merch:

[The CD you had to purchase to gain entry to the fan signing.](http://i.imgur.com/56uLX.jpg)  Not as fancy as the tin cased Korean version, but I have that one already anyways!

[Tiffany's signature.](http://i.imgur.com/wNpeB.jpg)  She was the first person in the line of girls, so I turned the pages of my booklet to her photo for her to sign it.  But after she signed it, she closed the booklet so all of the other members only signed the [front of it.](http://i.imgur.com/gzPGU.jpg)

When I got to Taeyeon, I asked if she would sign my Korean Gee cd as well.  She [graciously accepted.](http://i.imgur.com/4Rp1Q.jpg)

I was wearing a pink shirt and chinos, Tiffany complimented my outfit on how it [matches with the CDs in the case](http://i.imgur.com/HZGZf.jpg) and their outfits on the [cover of Japanese Gee](http://yeinjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/girls-generation-japan-gee.jpg).  I didn't even notice myself.  She asked me if I did it on purpose and of course I said yes ;)",67,49,False,self,,,,,

Most of the info is gathered from official posts or fan posts all around the forums, can't credit you all, but you know who you are, and thank you for your work.

Hyoyeon: Invincible Youth 2

Jessica: Drama (Wild Romance)

Taeyeon: MC (Music Core) and appearance on Salamander Guru

Tiffany: MC (Music Core)

Seohyun: MC (Music Core) and a CF

Sooyoung: For now just resting and looking more beautiful with every day.

Sunny: Musical (Catch Me If You Can), Invincible Youth 2 and MC for SBS MTV's Music Island

Yoona: Drama (Love Rain) and a CF

Yuri: Drama (Fashion King)



As a group:

An English album for US release around Spring/Summer (confirmed in recent interviews)

US tour (rumoured but very likely)

Korean album (talks about it around forums, but it's likely)

Japanese album (rumoured but likely)

Japanese tour (rumoured but likely)

Most of these, if true, should be around Q3/Q4 of 2012

This only makes me admire the even more, I wish I had the willpower to to 1/10th of this.

Good luck for them in all their endeavours.

This is a huge surprise for me and the fellow mods (and some our fellow subscribers), mainly because this subreddit is still quite small and we honestly need all the traffic that we can get. The last couple of days has been the most traffic this subreddit has ever seen and were all very excited about the growth. I honestly think that making a subreddit dedicated to just one girl stunts the growth of this subreddit, which would be sad because we've come such a long way from being a deserted, 'only 50 subscribers' subreddit, to a one that's growing on a daily basis.

I am, in no way, forcing people to stop what they want to do, but understand that this subreddit isn't prohibiting you from posting about your favorite member. You've already got people here willing to talk about SNSD and each individual girl, there's no need to have one solely focused on one individual. If you want to post something about Taeyeon or Yoona or any of the other girls, it's totally fine to post it here. We've finally established ourselves as a busy and growing community and I would just hate to lose traffic to posts that are more than welcome to be posted here. It's a lose - lose situation, we lose traffic and a smaller subreddit gets very little traffic in the process (and remember a subreddit can get closed down for little to no traffic).

At first this wasn't something I was really concerned about, but after reading some of the reactions in various threads and receiving a message from a concerned subscriber, I felt that this needed to be mentioned. We wont be making any new rules or anything like that, but I would like to see people's opinion on this subject.",32,66,False,self,,,,,

While it became apparent in the last topic on individual SNSD-member subreddits that they weren't too popular, I personally believe the existence of these subreddits can do no harm to [/r/SNSD](/r/SNSD) as long as the moderators keep encouraging everyone to 'spam' /r/SNSD with all the gifs, pictures and videos you can find. For the sake of completion, I tried to find [/r/seohyun](/r/seohyun) and [/r/yoona](/r/yoona) but unfortunately these two are private subreddits. From another comment I learned that [/r/LimYoona](/r/LimYoona) and [/r/SNSDYoona](/r/SNSDYoona) already exist though, and there's [/r/sooyoung](/r/sooyoung) to complete the list. Perhaps this will generate a bunch of downvotes, but in all honestly, I personally think that anyone who dislikes these initiatives so much that it deserves downvotes is just being a negative nancy. Just wanted to introduce these little reddits for those that *are* interested.

And with that, here is our results:

***

**Information on our subscribers:**

***

###[Sex / Gender](http://i.imgur.com/SIkeJ.png)

Staying true to our Reddit roots, **86%** of the 540 people (467 to be exact) are male, with only **14%** are female (73). So with that, I just wanted to say, 'whats up **DUDES**' lol.

###[Age](http://i.imgur.com/lnolC.png)

So that's **87%** of us that are between the ages 16 to 25. That's pretty much what I expected.

###[Ethnicity / Race](http://i.imgur.com/Q2BwN.png)

Once again, no surprises. Though I'm a little surprised that were not as diverse as I thought :O

###[Location](http://i.imgur.com/FE65R.png)

**59%** of us are from the US, followed by Canada and our European SONEs (both at **14%**).

**Results of the SoShi related questions:**

***

###[Favorite SNSD Member](http://i.imgur.com/waRfb.png)

ALL HAIL GLORIOUS '*KID*' LEADER.

###[Favorite Song](http://i.imgur.com/R83Dy.png)

The most popular song (with **23%**) goes to [TMYW \(Genie\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO88dHOqBlc), followed by 'Undecided / Other'. So the most popular promoted song on [/r/SNSD](/r/SNSD) is Genie, but quite a few of you like some other song that wasn't promoted. Maybe I should have made the list a little longer, but it's nice to see that their non-promoted songs are well received :D

###[Favorite Album](http://i.imgur.com/ItOrA.png)

Out of all the SoShi questions, this is the only one with 'Undecided' as the most picked (**25%**). After that, Oh! + RDR album barely edges their Japan First Album (**21%** &gt; **20%**). Undecided wins, but the single album with the most votes goes to '**Oh!**'.",67,57,False,self,,,,,

I'm not proposing this as an actual suggestion to SM Entertainment, I'm sure they'll get around to exploring other countries when they get time (despite how much I'd actually love to see the girls visit London or somewhere).

This thread is mainly just to confer with any UK-based fans here which shows might be better for them to appear on and why, we have a niche market compared to the variety offered by the vast population and diversity in the states, so Britain might actually be a bit harder to SNSD to conquer, but I'm sure there are some variety shows they can perform on.

Firstly, the top musical variety bill in the UK is obviously **""Later... with Jools Holland""** - This would probably be a good all-rounder because of the variety of acts that are on, having had pop, rock, jazz, fusion, orchestral, metal, and all sorts of different genre on the show before. Though Jools doesn't normally do interviews with all of the guests, so to randomly have the girls perform in the middle of a show might make them seem a bit random, or people wouldn't really pay as much attention.

Another good show to appear on would probably be **""The Jonathan Ross Show""** due to the guests on that show having as much variety as Letterman's, though they normally tend to be mainly British guests, plus the very vocal and communal feel of the show, involving all of the guests in the green room and stuff, might be a bit awkward for the members who don't speak very good English.

There are a whole host of other variety shows in the UK; Graham Norton and Alan Carr to name a small few, but I'm wondering what other people would think, specifically UK fans, how would the public respond to SNSD and what would be their best plan of attack?",9,9,False,default,,,,,

What are your experiences finding the CD in stores? The Best Buy in Times Square is not applicable as the girls were actually there to promote.

Im just wondering why in live performances, why is yuri's voice always... ""altered"" ? For example they will apply a strange effect to her voice so it sounds like she is echoing, or she will have really loud backing vocals.

Just one example is this performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAq04pOcH6c

All the members are singing live, even Hyoyeon and Yoona who are not the greatest singers, but you can hear them all clearly with no aid to their singing, whereaS Yuri has this weird echoing effect but ive heard she has a good voice?

That link is just one example, ive noticed it in loads and loads of performances (for example in THE BOYS promotions you can never actually hear her rapping over the backing vocals) - i dunno if it is that she sings badly, i just dont understand why they never let us hear her sing?",21,18,False,self,,,,,

Kim Taeyeon. A simple performance by you has the ability to blow me away. A single word you speak can cause my heart to speed up. A single smile, a single laugh, a single gesture can cause me to go insane. Kim Taeyeon, if only I could express how much you affected my life. I cant imagine my life if I hadnt stumbled across a simple video of one of SNSDs music videos. I cant imagine my life if I hadnt seen you in that music video. I cant image my life if I hadnt curiously Googled your name and read an article on you. Ever since that article, youve been my hero. I become hurt when people tell me Im not a true fan of you, and this is all just a phase. I cant control my anger when things like that pop up. Why would people even think I would only think these things because this is a phase. This is not just a phase, its a turning point that Ive come upon. I would call you my ultimate bias, or my supreme, but I think youve surpassed those titles. Youre not only my ultimate bias, but you are also my hero. People ask me how you can be my hero if Ive never seen you in person, or spoken to you in person. Does that matter? I really dont think so. 

Youre my hero, and you saved me from myself. Oh the burden I must have given everyone in my life until I stumbled across you. I cant imagine my future without SNSD in it. You all were the ones who saved me and kept me alive, and you, Taeyeon, showed me that life is worth living. All of the years you practiced and worked until you got to where you are today; it was worth it, wasnt it? Since you worked so hard in getting where you are now, I can work hard as well and fulfill my dream to keep every one happy. I have been called selfless, but I cant help it, really. Ever since I changed, I can only think of others before myself. I have to thank you for shining that light in my face. I dont know how many times Ive been called strange for thinking this about you and myself, but I always come back to the thought that I need to believe what I want to believe. Am I taking this too seriously? Has this whole bias thing gone to my head? No. I believe its true. I wish I could express myself openly, but the scars will not heal. 

The way you cried during this song. The way you smile at the end. I got the reassuring feeling that everything will be okay, eventually. I have aged and met new friends along this path. New friends that are willing to listen and stay by my side. I couldnt have even taken this path without you, Kim Taeyeon. I wish I could give you the letter I wrote the day I made the decision to stay. But for now, my admiration for you will continue to grow, and I will continue to look up at you as my hero.

So, what I can remember was that I'm pretty sure it was something that had to do with the Japanese album. The 9 girls were standing in a sort of mirror-y area with snow (?). I think. If not snow, I do remember everything seemed kind of sparkly or something. And it was a few minutes of just different shots of them and there was sort of this slower music that eventually built up into something faster. And then it seemed like ""darker"" versions of them appeared from out of the mirrors or something like that. And then the music was much faster and more intense.

329,SNSD,t5_2s1g4,2012-2-20,2012,2,20,13,pxd4h,self.SNSD,[translated] Japanese GQ features SNSD (August 2011),https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/pxd4h/translated_japanese_gq_features_snsd_august_2011/,fiveSeveN_,1329712745,"&gt;As the power of K-pop continues to steadily spread globally, the world is turning their attention to the nine talented entertainers with world-class appearances, vocals and dancing skills, whom we grew to know and love as Girls Generation or SNSD.
&gt;
&gt;GQ Japan became the first magazine for men to conduct an interview and photo shoot with SNSD, who represents not only Korea but the entire Asia. Through the interview, we get a closer look at the real SNSD and we want to stop talking only about their beautiful legs, which is a problem not only in Japan but the whole world as they regarded SNSD as Idols with pretty legs.
&gt;
&gt;Along with other K-pop representatives, SNSD is steadily rising in their position as pop stars to capture the attention of not only Asia, but the whole world. Their agency, SM Entertainment, held two successful sessions of an all-star concert SM Town Live in the continent of Europe and the tickets were sold out within 10 minutes!
&gt;
&gt;As far as the opposite side of the Earth in Brazil, there is a fanclub for them and the girls also made it as a representative and main focus in BBC and Frances 2nd TVs broadcast about the globalization of K-pop, as they are regarded as the best representative of K-pop as a whole.
&gt;
&gt;Along with their popularity, SNSDs value to market products has also greatly increased as proven from the Chocolate Love PV for LG to working with famed director James Cameron for the promotion of Samsungs 3D TV. Later, they worked with one of the biggest computer processor producer in the world Intel for their Asian Campaign and provided another PV, namely Visual Dreams because they have attractive appearances and are also believed to be capable of raising the sales rate of the already well-known product.
&gt;
&gt;However, what we are trying to say here is that these amazing results did not come out of nowhere. In order to get started in K-pop, you are usually required to spend around five to eight years as trainees, besides aiming for the global market primarily. Thus, having Jessica and Tiffany, who have lived in the US, is an advantage and a great weapon for SNSD.
&gt;
&gt;Besides that, the staff working closely with the group and supporting them are also top-class composers, song writers and choreographers. They have all the necessities for productions aiming for worldwide promotion.
&gt;
&gt;For a top group like SNSD, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that they are not arrogant at all when you actually get to meet them in person. Rather, they are sweet and straightforward girls, so sometimes it feels as if they are not defending themselves. They have extremely good relationships with each other even when each member is unique and different from the others.
&gt;
&gt;One of the main strengths of SNSD is that every member is an all-round player that can switch to any positions of the group and yet keep their charms and uniqueness. Each member is great in terms of vocals and dancing, and some are exceptionally talented in either one.
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, each member had the chance to expand her talents in individual commercials, dramas or variety shows so all nine members have their own territories to shine in and they do not have fixed positions such as leader or centre.
&gt;
&gt;In 2009, wearing identical performance uniforms, they performed Gee and Genie, showing how SNSD is a group of all-round players. To get to know more of SNSDs true selves, it is recommended for readers to search on YouTube for their charismatic dance steps, great vocals singing famous western music and as well as their playful sides in talk shows.
&gt;
&gt;When asked about their strength to help them stand out from other groups around the world, Jessica replied,We have nine colors, just like how the colors of the rainbow vary. Furthermore, the energy and teamwork shines brighter when all nine of us are together.
&gt;
&gt;Like what Jessica said, fans around the world focus mainly on their uniqueness as well as teamwork. Not only that, the fact that they are very hardworking is also their weapon to success. Each member has gone through 10 hours of harsh training every day during their teenage years. This story itself has become a unique and valuable part of SNSD and this uniqueness has motivated each member to work even harder.
&gt;
&gt;Taeyeon talked about their latest single Mr. Taxi and stated, The dance moves were hard. However, since we have been singing and dancing to a wide range of songs, this song wasnt exceptionally hard.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, when asked about the song which can best represent SNSD, Sooyoung answered, Run Devil Run because it is the coolest and most artistic song. Also, we enjoyed performing this song the most.
&gt;
&gt;The girls do not allow themselves to feel proud or satisfied by only having the cute image as stars.
&gt;
&gt;Maxime Paque, who runs Korean Connection, a French K-pop fansite, stated, They are all hardworkers compared to some European stars. Korean stars are just like athletes.
&gt;
&gt;These girls do not only have to care about their health, have daily training, but also listen to Corinne Bailey Rae or Bruno Mars, and watch online video sites to try out new dance steps.
&gt;
&gt;SNSD, who works hard day and night, can proudly state that they know their own values and the expectations of fans.
&gt;
&gt;So, we cannot help but wonder, why is the world attracted to them?
&gt;
&gt;Their agency, SM Entertainment, have used worldwide platforms such as YouTube in order to expand their stage globally. Because they have shared the growth of SNSD as a group, they have also successfully created fans worldwide. You can even think that when SNSD is releasing a Japanese PV, there are more international fans waiting than Japanese fans. Through these global modes of communications, SNSD has improved their attractiveness and more fans look forward to their next albums.
&gt;
&gt;K-pop and Bollywood are the two best examples of successfully integrating YouTube into a business strategy. Because American pop music has already been known worldwide, YouTube was used only to slightly expand on their popularity.
&gt;
&gt;However, it is a completely different story for K-pop. There are not much ways that Europe and South America can get to know K-pop. Thus, they have to find out about K-pop themselves through YouTube and Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Luca, an administrator of a Brazilian SNSD fan site stated, While I was searching for pretty computer wallpapers, I came across the nine beautiful girls and started to search about them. 2 years ago, it was extremely difficult to find information about them. However, due to the internet, there are more and more fans. Our site has around 3,000 to 4,000 visits daily now.
&gt;
&gt;Maxime Paquet stated, I think that the French listeners are slowly getting sick of western pop culture. K-pop is extremely similar to American pop culture. However, they have something that American pop culture is lacking in. Furthermore, K-pop entertainers have shown their high quality as all-round entertainers. They all sing and dance very well. Maybe the fact that their hardwork is shown clearly during their performances is fresh to the French listeners. K-pop listeners are still increasing in number and I assume that theres around a hundred thousand listeners in France.
&gt;
&gt;People compared K-pop artists with American pop artists and chose to listen to K-pop, a genre of music from a far eastern country and the same thing is happening in Japan. It is also said that the teenagers react most to SNSD.
&gt;
&gt;Even though no one tells them who sings and dances better, Japanese teenagers will naturally know by comparing SNSD to other Japanese idols. They will then accept SNSD as well as the fact that their success is the product of their hardwork.
&gt;
&gt;K-pop is trying to replace what was called as western music. We cant say for sure why the new global stars are cute Asians. It might be the result of great business strategies, or it might be because the world has been desiring something Asian for a long time.
&gt;
&gt;We wont answer why it has to be these 9 girls for this phenomenon to happen. What we can tell you is that if the 21st century were to be the age for Asians, then the success of SNSD is the sign for the start of that age.

&gt;Meanwhile, here is the interview we conducted with each of the nine girls of SNSD, where ten questions were asked. The ten questions asked to SNSD are as follows:
&gt;
&gt;**1. How would you describe your personality in one word?**
&gt;
&gt;**2. When was the moment you were glad to be a member of SNSD?**
&gt;
&gt;**3.  What strength do you think you have that you can be proud of internationally?**
&gt;
&gt;**4. Please tell us which member you respect and why you respect her.**
&gt;
&gt;**5. Which song and artist are you into right now?**
&gt;
&gt;**6. What do you want to develop more on as an artist?**
&gt;
&gt;**7. Which Korean celebrity do you admire? Whats the reason?**
&gt;
&gt;**8. What made you happy recently?**
&gt;
&gt;**9. What compliment makes you happy?**
&gt;
&gt;**10. Whats your ideal dating course?**",5,14,False,self,,,,,
