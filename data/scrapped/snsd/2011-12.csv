118,SNSD,t5_2s1g4,2011-12-20,2011,12,20,18,njouq,self.SNSD,New to SNSD? This post is for you :D,https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/njouq/new_to_snsd_this_post_is_for_you_d/,DJ_Byun,1324373830,"Browsing around [/r/SNSD](/r/SNSD) I've noticed quite a few posts of people asking for more info on certain SNSD related subjects. Newer fans are probably curious about the shows SNSD have been on (which would explain inside jokes that long time fans would know lol), as well as SNSD's past songs / albums. To help the newer fans, I've compiled a list of required SoShi viewing. Hopefully this helps newer fans who are interested in learning more about SNSD, who necessarily don't know how to go about finding what they want.

****

**Required Viewing:**

* *Girls Go to School* (2007): A 9 episode documentary of SNSD, covering their time right before and during their debut. It shows the girls moving in together for the first time, as well showing their first live performance on Mnet's **School of Rock**. See how it all started and see how far these girls have come. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B4FCF006758F167&amp;feature=plcp).

* *MTV's Girls' Generation* (2007): Another documentary filmed around the same time as GGTS, this one is also 9 episodes long, with each episode focusing on one member at a time (starting with Sooyoung and ending with Taeyeon). Get to know the quirks, personalities and aspirations of each member. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2BB92300435644E6&amp;feature=plcp).

****

**Variety Show Appearances:**

* *Factory Girl* (2008): A show focusing on SNSD as fashion interns for **Elle Girl, Korea**. They are divided into two groups, and the two groups are then put into fashion competitions (the teams are; **Candy Girls**, Taeyeon, Jessica, Sunny, Yuri and Yoona - **Dream Girls**, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Seohyun and Sooyoung). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4DF8F05542C11575&amp;feature=plcp).

* *Horror Movie Factory* (2009): A variety show that focuses on having the girls go through 'scary' moments in order to help them with their acting in various situations. It's a short show, only having 6 episodes and the premise of the show changes about 3 episodes in. It goes from the girls experiencing scary moments while acting out scenarios and ends up as an extended acting lesson for the girls. It's filled with hilarious moments from the girls. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-snsd-horror-movie-factory-eng-sub/).

* *SNSD's Hello Baby!* (2009): A show about SNSD taking on the role of moms as they babysit a baby for months (not entirely sure how long, maybe half a year?). An awesome show filled with laughs and awkward moments (watching 9 girls attempt to change a baby **boy's** diaper is hilarious). It was supposed to be a show about teaching the girls the roles of motherhood, but it ended up being a show with SNSD playing with a baby and with each other. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/kbs-joy-snsd-hello-baby-season-1-eng-sub/).

* *Invincible Youth (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - Present): A variety show which puts idol girls in the middle of rural South Korea and are taught how to live the life of a farmer. They learn how to farm certain vegetables, they learn how to take care of farm animals, they learn how to drive farming machines, and they learn how to cook. Watch as the girls go from 'City Idols' to 'Farming Idols' and their growth as friends. Season 1 had our very own **Sunny** and **Yuri**, and also starred fellow idol girls; **Narsha** from the Brown Eyed Girls, **Hara** from Kara, **Hyuna** from 4minute, **Hyomin** from T-ARA and **Sunhwa** from Secret. Later on in the show it also had; **Victoria** from f(x), **Juyeon** from After School and solo singer **Sori**. Watch Season 1 [HERE](http://entertainments10.blogspot.com/2010/11/invincible-youth.html) (Thanks to [kimbrough](http://www.reddit.com/user/kimbrough) for the link). Season 2 of Invincible Youth is currently airing, new location (a fishing village) and new members. The new members are ; **Sunny** and **Hyoyeon**, **Woori** from Rainbow, **Bora** from Sistar, **Jiyoung** from Kara, **Amber** from f(x), **Suzy** from Miss A and **Yewon** from Jewelry. Watch Season 2 [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-56NNoV9zfc&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL7B1F36AA29B09E5F).

* *We Got Married (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - 2011): A variety show which puts random celebrities into fake marriages (yes you read that right lol). They do what any married couple does, they move into a house, they cook together, they go on dates, and they actually take wedding pictures together. **Season 1** had our very own 'Kid Leader' Taeyeon, who was paired up with popular comedian Jung Hyungdon. They were nicknamed the '**Pudding and Jelly**' couple. Watch the couple [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-wgm-pudding-and-jelly-couple-eng-sub/). **Season 2** had our innocent, sometimes borderline unemotional, maknae Seohyun, who was paired up with the leader and lead vocalist of idol band CN Blue, Jung Yonghwa. They were nicknamed the '**Goguma**' couple (for Seohyun's love for sweet potatoes) and the '**YongSeo**' couple (**Yong**hwa + **Seo**hyun). Season 2 is definitely a must watch for fans, Season 1 was very short and had some funny moments, but it wasn't really engaging (the age difference between Taeyeon and Hyungdon really turned off some people, and the fact that he was in actual relationship at the time didn't help at all). The YongSeo couple moments are fantastic, unless you're a huge Seohyun fanboy who gets jealous easily lol. Watch the YongSeo couple [HERE](http://gogumaepisodes.blogspot.com/p/goguma-episodes.html).

* *Girls' Generation and the Dangerous Boys* (2012): Their newest variety show, it puts the girls as guidance counselors for troubled boys (high school boys). The girls are divided into 5 different groups to guide 5 different boys. The boys themselves will actually be living together as well. Watch the first episode [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/user/taenacity#p/u/4/tq9Vyc5BRoA).

* *Numerous Popular Show Appearances* (2007 - Present): Part of the girls' ridiculous fame is the amount of shows they have appeared on. Newer fans may have watched awesome clips of SNSD on shows but have no idea where they are from, so I compiled a list of shows that they have appeared on. Shows: **Family Outing, Running Man, Strong Heart, Star Golden Bell, Star King, Happy Together, and Star Life Theater.** Find these shows on [Soshified](http://soshified.com/), the biggest SNSD international fan website on the internet.

****

**Drama Appearances:**

* *Unstoppable Marriage* (2007): Featuring cameos from Yuri and Sooyoung. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_Marriage).

* *You Are My Destiny* (2008): Yoona's first major role, it's also the role that helped her break through in terms of acting (she won an award for best new actress for her role as Jang Saebyuk). It's a daily drama which is a whopping 178 episodes long. If you're a fan of Yoona, it's a must watch. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_My_Destiny_\(TV_series\)).

* *Cinderella Man* (2009): Yoona's second major role, a mini-series which is only 16 episodes long (each episode is about an hour). It didn't do very well ratings wise, but I enjoyed it more than YAMD. [WATCH HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/40/1/Cinderella_Man/).

* *Fashion King* (Currently Airing): Yuri's first major role in a drama, she plays a fashion designer named 'Choi Anna'. Watch Fashion King [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4100/1/Fashion_King/).

* *Love Rain* (Currently Airing): Yoona's third major role (her first in almost 3 years), it's a double role, as she plays two characters in the series (her co-star Jang Geun Suk also plays two roles). Watch Love Rain [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4099/1/Love_Rain/).

Once again, if you're looking for subs for these shows, join Soshified. They have all of Yoona's drama subbed (that includes the 178 episodes of YAMD).

**Suggested Shows from Fellow Fans:**

* *Champagne* (2009): Their first appearance on the show was filled with jokes, impersonations and little bit of aeygo from our girls. The best part of the show was towards the end, when they divide into two groups and are put into a competition on who can make the production team laugh. Watch their first appearance [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35aiGjQ4daU). Their second appearance on Champagne was more of the same, but Yoona (who was absent on their first filming) is put into a 'Ideal Type Tournament', where she chooses male celebrities in a tournament of looks. Watch their second appearance on Champagne [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL1G4dWanz4).

* *Sang Sang Plus* (2009): A talk show / variety show, their first appearance on the show, the girls (Yoona, Yuri, Sooyoung and Tiffany) are asked funny questions by the MCs, one of the MCs is actually Park Jaejung, which Yoona fans remember as Kang Hose from her drama 'You Are My Destiny'. Expect funny moments between those two. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73lfOyA-fW4). They guest star once again on SSP, this time with SM juniors, SHINee. Get to know Old-Fashioned Soonkyu (Sunny), Jealous Miyoung (Fany) and Cheap (Ssanti) Yoona. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/eng-sub-091208-sang-sang-plus-ep-259-snsd-shinee-cut/). (Thank you to honeyhoney for the links).

* *Intimate Note* (2009): Quite possibly one of SNSD's finest variety show appearances (if not the best, it's certainly up there as a required viewing). It's one hour of the girls arguing with each other about mundane subjects, ranging from Taeyeon's ridiculous sleeping habits, Sooyoung and her tendency to be messy and gross, all the way to Maknae Seohyun's stubbornness and habit of talking back to her unnies. The girls are divided into 2 groups (the tall and short teams) and they go at each other in ridiculously funny jabs and insults. A must watch for all fans. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CcrJbtkiiM&amp;feature=related).

* *The HahaMong Show* (2010): A show hosted by MC Mong and HaHa (popular artists, as well as part time variety show personalities), where they go around spending time with K-Pop idols. Their episode with SNSD involved the two of them dressed up as moms as they 'kidnap' the girls in front of one of SM's buildings. They act as SNSD moms for the day and in typical SNSD fashion they argue about mundane subjects (similar to Intimate Note). It ends on a pretty touching note with Sooyoung and her mother :). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPXKDQDyoA).

* *Win Win* (2010): A talk show which our dear 'Kid Leader' is also an MC for. The talk show ranges from different subjects, most of it being hilarious. Get to know some of SNSD's personal habits, from their drinking experiences, television preferences, who they think is the most attractive without make up on and other funny subjects. The show changes gears towards the end, when the subjects become a little more serious, with the girls talking about their rise to fame, their thoughts about their future together as a group and even a little talk about love ;). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYuUvRyHWZE).

* *Happy Together* (2010): Another talk show / variety show starring our girls and popular comedians Yoo Jaesuk and Park Myungsoo (YAH YAH). Get to know some of their experiences from Japan, their ventriloquism skills, Sooyoung's ridiculous impersonation skills, and Yuri's 'hyper-active past'. Oh and also, **water guns** ;). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghlRjMcxcEs). (Thank you to honeyhoney for the links).

* *Night Star* (2010): A show filmed late at night, where the girls reveal good deeds each of them has done in the past, and these good deeds are than 'judged' by food (confusing? Watch and you'll understand lol). The highlight of the show is in the second episode, when they go out on the streets and ask questions to the people. ""*South Korea's national girl group is who?*"" To answer that questions, watch Night Star [HERE](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xh0irh_1-4-night-star-ep-27-snsd-11-28-10-en_shortfilms#from=embediframe&amp;start=0) and [HERE](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xh0v66_1-4-night-star-ep-28-snsd-12-05-10-en_shortfilms). (Thank you to honeyhoney for the links).

* *Running Man* (Currently Airing): Dubbed as an 'urban' variety show, the cast of the show are thrown into very intense games around different South Korean iconic places (from Seoul all the way to Jeju Island, and even a few appearances outside of South Korea, like Bangkok and Hong Kong). It's an awesome show, filled intense games and hilarious parts (it stars popular comedian Yoo Jaesuk, singer + buff man Kim Jongkook and many others). The girls have appeared in a total of 6 episodes (ep. 4 and 5 with Jessica, ep. 16 with Yuri, ep. 39 with Sunny and Yoona, ep. 63 and 64 with Taeyeon, Jessica, Yuri, Seohyun, Yoona and Hyoyeon). Watch episodes 63 and 64 [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJE6RIRuwL4) and [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChVh2DhS0jQ&amp;feature=related). If you're interested in watching the other episodes, or even interested in watching Running Man itself (it's a fantastic show), go to [iSubs](http://isubs-squad.com/forum/). Their subs are free and are fantastic quality and all you need is to join in order to download them.

* *Star Golden Bell* (Various Years): A game show that stars different Korean celebrities from different forms of entertainment. It has a question portion where the MCs ask humorous questions to their guests and then there is the game portion of the show, where the guests play 'Korean Word' games. SNSD has appeared numerous times, but their best appearances can be found [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/eng-sub-star-golden-bell-sgb-ep-224/), [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/eng-sub-star-golden-bell-sgb-ep-245/) and [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/eng-sub-star-golden-bell-sgb-ep-248/) (Thanks again to honeyhoney for the links). 

****

**Radio Broadcasts:**

* *Shim Shim Tapa* (2010): Hosted by Super Junior's Shindong, the girls take part in an awesome broadcast where they answer personal questions about themselves. The questions range from, 'Which girl is the most hated within the group?' and 'Which girl has the most embarrassing pictures?'. It ends as well as you all think, fights, arguments and laughs galore. It also contains the infamous '*I'll push you down a flight of stairs*' threat from Sunny to Yoona lol. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhRyhK0uzo).
