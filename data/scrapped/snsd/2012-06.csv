Would be nice if you post some cool sights (SNSD Spots like this Taeyeon Shrine) and tourist attraction for me to visit. 

There are few question I wanna know before I visit: 

* 1. Are there many merchandising shops about SNSD, and where I should buy all my fanstuff? 
* 2. Is it true, that SPAO is really cheap there, I want to buy some clothes, too. :D
* 3. Is there any possibilty to meet/see the girls next month in Seoul ?

However; I can't seem to get into the feeling of the non-70's era episodes. I made it all the way through episode 5 and felt bad about watching it. I hate to see the same actor who played Suh In Ya playing such a character that is so different. I mean, I'm sure it gets better and there's more emotion in the next 15 episodes. But I really can't stand that character, while Ha Na doesn't seem nearly as genuine as Kim Yoon Hee.

Basically what I'm asking is for a synopsis of what happens in the new-era one because I really love the story, I just can't get over the 'new' characters, because the first four episodes were so damn good, and the characters were so easy to relate too. 

TL;DR: I don't like new-era Love Rain characters compared to the 70's-era. Please give me a synopsis of what happens because I can't bear to watch 15 episodes of these characters :(.

It's not about this subreddit, and it's talking more about memes but it is a similar problem, so please read in response to the ""just downvote what you don't like"" argument. We should discuss these things now before any problem becomes too big to fix.

**I'm glad that I made this post as it has encouraged genuine discussion about a potential problem. I find it funny that that people are going on downvote rampages and downvoting everything I comment here, disregarding the actual content of the comment, because they disagree with my main post or don't think the subreddit should change (I never even said that it should) but if you're curious, here's what the downvote button is actually for. Key quotes: ""If you think it does not contribute to reddit or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it."" ""Don't downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion."" But feel free to continue downvoting my comments if you think that it bothers me.**

*****

I feel like history is repeating itself here, and a lot of the stuff I'm gonna say was mentioned a while ago on r/kpop before the infamous rule change.

I know this post probably won't go down too well, and a lot of people are gonna tell me I'm wrong, but I've been feeling this way for a while and I thought I might aswell say something, I've got nothing to lose.

My problem is the quality of posts on this subreddit. Recently, the subreddit is flooded with image posts and macros etc. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, because obviously this is the SNSD subreddit, so it is appropriate to post pictures of SNSD. However I feel a lot of it is just people desperate for karma. The subreddit has kind of become a Taeyeon shrine, and any picture of Taeyeon doing something remotely cute will soar to the top and it's the same people that keep on posting those kinds of pictures.

Fair enough, we all enjoy image posts. For example, if one of the members has a new haircut, then do share it! If there is a funny macro, then share it. But is it really necessary to flood pointless pictures and galleries that don't really add anything to the subreddit? There is the new subreddit /r/kpics that a lot of this content could go to.

The main reason I'm complaining is because actual news and performances aren't visible on this subreddit recently. Sure, you can say downvote or don't look at the content you don't like - but that's hard to do when it's like 95% of the actual content, and nobody even upvotes actual news and performances. They just bet buried in a sea of pictures that people mindlessly upvote. Hyoyeon showing some skin? TO THE TOP! Almost-creepy worshipping of a member's beauty in GIF-form? TO THE TOP! And so on.

I understand that this subreddit has reached a large number of subscribers and that is why it is becoming the way it is recently (I've been lurking here since the start and it used to be a lot better) but /r/kpop was actually saved by introducing some rules, and now it's an awesome place and not a wasteground of images. /r/2ne1 is probably the group subreddit I visit most and there isn't really any pointless pic spam there. New performances actually get upvoted to the top so people can see them, and the posts are generally interesting and relevant, and newly released pictures are still there, just not flooding the page.

**Tl;dr:** My main point is - couldn't we focus more on relevant SNSD content on this subreddit, and have the less relevant content ie cute/sexy photos of the members posted to /r/kpics instead? I think it would improve both subreddits a lot.

**I'm not suggesting that strict rules must be created, or certain posts banned or anything like that. I'm just asking for a discussion. I'd like to hear other peoples' opinions on this.**",81,53,False,self,,,,,

Now this is old news, but it made think about one thing. 
Everyone knows about the 5 years grudge in pop groups. I think that SNSD can pass that mark confortably because the industry is expanding and the girls are the ones best taking advantage.
But if we look at this year there was the TTS album, there will be the Korean and Japanese album and there are rumors about a English album. This looks like SM is squeezing every option they have with the group while they can, like they know it can't last long enough to wait a few months, or that the popularity and consequently the profitability can't make it long.
Alot of other big names in K-Pop will have comebacks, so maybe this is just a bold move from SM to not loose it's grip on the market, along with the f(x) and SUJU comeback.
Or the last opition, i just need to stop imagining things. Afterall each album will be for diferent markets, but still...
Anyways I'm really divided and  I will like to hear anyone's opinion on this matter.

[Flash](http://i.imgur.com/S8OFu.jpg)

Firstly, the entire reason I decided to shoutout SNSD and SSF was because I knew K-Pop was already a big player in the Starcraft scene (GSL and IU), and IPL4 in Las Vegas started to introduce songs like Bubble Pop and Good Day, etc. I figured SNSD should be given a chance since EVERYONE knows Gee. Also, I knew that some SONEs were watching the stream (chelupa and DJ sekshi from SSF) and wanted to embarrass myself haha.

Secondly, I was going to bring something bland, like a SC:BW CD or SC2 DVD to get signed during the KeSPA autograph session, but decided, ""hey, I have a poster with Soshi, and Intel. Obviously I need to bring this"". So waiting in line I was pretty nervous on seeing their reactions to it (especially since everyone around me in line had a weird reaction to my poster, like I was crazy). But once I got there, the first in the autograph session was Bisu. At first he had a blank look in his face, then  ""OHH SO NYUH SHI DAE"" with an excited expression on his face. Each player had their own excited reaction to the poster. I asked Flash and Fantasy who their favorite members were and they signed their names on the members (Flash-Seohyun, FanTaSy-Taeyeon). Also noticed that a Korean reporter was taking pictures for each player signing the poster (noticed that he did not for the other autographs haha) and finally he took a picture of me holding up the poster proudly. So I guess I'll show up somewhere on the Korean internets.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I'll end with this. MLG was an AMAZING event for my first time and I'm glad people took notice of my Soshi spreading.",14,67,False,self,,,,,

/r/SNSD is being FLOODED with pictures. There is another subreddit for that, /r/kpics and i beg you please use that instead. I'm not  saying that we shouldn't have pictures of our Girls' Generation in here but can't you go looking for karma on another subreddit? I mean isn't this one for info on snsd and what they are doing? One good page contain like 4 links of what the girls do and the rest are pictures of Taengoo thinking dat ass. Granted that not much is happening right now (not that i know about at least).
I know that another post about this was written not long ago but it did not help obviously.
What i want to say is: Don't stop posting pictures of the girls but if you see that the last 5-9(!) posts were pictures or gifs think again about posting your picture or gif.

That would be silly. I wanted to remind ppl to vote for SNSD on the [Mnet 20s Choice Poll](http://global.mnet.com/choice/vote.m). If you don't know how to get on Mnet check [this](http://goo.gl/j8jqMl) out.

Currently YoonA is leading Drama Star Female 34% to 32% over Ha JiWon. I'm not going to lie, this was a tough choice. I watched As One recently and wow, that was a great movie! TTS is behind Big Bang 28% to 31% for Trendy Music. GD is edging out Sooyoung in the Style category 36% to 32%. VIP's on top of things there so far. Lastly for Global Star, SuJu is leading SNSD 37% to 28%. I know, sad-face.

You can vote once a day for this and there are still 15 days left. Plenty of time to tell people and get more votes. I'm sure there are many that don't really like to spend time voting for these polls repeatedly. But this one is Mnet! Plus, once you register, select and enter your votes, those choices are saved. So the next day you need only hit submit to complete the process.

Spread the word. Use the Facebook and the Twitter and the Tumblrs! It must pain you a bit to see SNSD losing Global Star doesn't it? Just a little? Not yet? Give it a second..it will.

Think of how the girls will react when they see they were voted number 1? [Probably like this.](http://i.imgur.com/hXkqw.gif) That's right, high fives for all.",1,15,False,self,,,,,

Just wanted to share this soshified forum post that I saw making the rounds on Tumblr today. The writing can be a bit cheesy at times; but, come on, who among us doesn't get a bit cheesy when it comes to SNSD? 

The post basically talks about how eventually what we have come to know and love as SNSD will come to an end. I mean, it's pretty crazy to think that SNSD is now entering their FIFTH year. Five years is a long time for an idol group and songs like Gee and Into the New World are considered classics now. I honestly can't imagine a KPop world without SNSD, but this is something that's actually been on my mind a lot lately. [big heavy sigh]

**Reproduced below for those without a Soshified account. However, if you're a SONE, you'd might want to consider getting on Soshified.**

*Fans are blessed and then cursed. It's a cycle, you see. Sort of like, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' The best of times because there's magic here. Magic. The kind a four year old sees at his birthday party, before he becomes a know-it-all. Magic that's REAL. Where else in our humdrum lives can we feel like a part of something so powerfully perfect, so wonderfully gorgeous, so egregiously welcoming and attractive?*

*But this magic, it comes with an expiration date, doesn't it? That's the curse part.*

*Fandoms face inevitable obsolescence as their idols age and then move onto other things in life. New idols, new groups come up and some fans move on, into other fandoms or out to other genres or indeed out to the real world, never to look back, quickly forgetting this time in life as the pressures of adulthood become overwhelming.*

*Those who stay, stubbornly, are at best relegated to reliving glory days that only fade with time, their fandom's numbers dwindling until a decade later they're left with grainy non-3D videos and broken ipod/pad/phones and dead hard drives full of old images in seldom used formats.*

*Really, especially in this digital age, truly nothing is forever.*

*Other fandoms are waning even now, dreading the coming months, the coming year, shrill and desperate, feeling the waters of irrelevance creeping up their cheeks... pity them. Really, you should pity them. Because one day, that will be you, defiant but knowing the end is nigh...*

*But that (probably) is in some distant future for us.* 

*Still, this won't last. It can't last. The 9 work in a business, a harsh business and someday their replacements will debut, new girls who will become even bigger than the 9 ever were.*

*Though those are awfully large high heels to fill.*

*But truthfully, honestly, the 9 won't want it to last either. Weariness wears on a person. Greener grass and biological clocks and the pressures of family. No. Not forever. The 9 will want to have lives out of the light, they will want families of their own. Young women, yes? Not girls, not anymore.*

*They've grown up to our endless delight, grown up responsibly, wonderfully, beautifully, and they continue to grow. We can only keep pictures, mementos of their years with us, as they marry or take on other professions. Actress, soloist, model, diplomat, housewife. Who knows. Not even they do.*

*But it isn't for us to wish them still. We can't do that. We can't expect them to always be ours. Our memories of them, the jpeg's, the gif's, the mov's and avi's, sure. Youtube will be a collective consciousness for us to point at to our nieces and nephews and children.*

*""Ugh. That's so OLD fashioned! How could you LIKE that?""*

*""SHUTUP, CHILD. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!""*

*Yes. That'll be us. Then.*

*For now,*

*These are the good days. The BEST days. Grasp these days, seize them tight. Cherish them, savor them, every beat and pose of every release, every surge of popularity, every new market opened, every cardboard box from Amazon or Yesasia, every rolled up poster and photobook of silly faces and gorgeous eyes and smiles.*

*Grasp these days as tight as our girls are doing, as THEY know the improbability of their existence and success as SNSD. Hard work, luck, timing, the support of dozens in their company and other companies, the support of their fandom and the creativity of hundreds of others around the world have given them this chance. Magic indeed, magical to such an extravagant degree as to be unbelievable.*

*But they did this. They have made it their own. With sweat and tears and years of grueling schedules. KPop wouldn't be where it is without them. Just as the first generation of idols made it possible for THEM, THEY make it possible for the NEXT. This progression of hoobae to sunbae to legend. They continue to leave their mark and they'll leave it to a changed industry, the shadow they cast looming huge for the next generations.*

*The are and they remain the class of the idol world. The very best. They've shown they deserve us, the very best fandom in KPop. And we need to be the very best. We need to earn this magic. As their fans, as SONES, be gracious, be kind, be worthy of their efforts. In short, be people they can be proud of having as their fans. Remember this. Jeering at others isn't cheering for THEM.*

*Nothing this good is free. Nothing this perfect is without cost. Even if you've never bought one of their albums, there's still a price to be paid for loving them, and that is growing up with them, learning to someday say goodbye with grace and hope and the very best of wishes. As hard as that will be, as much as it will hurt, we'll have to say goodbye to the magic.*

*Nothing is forever. Don't take these days for granted. They don't. Each award, each win, each concert, fanmeet, each new dance routine, each new stage, you know they've done their best to prepare, as they do, EVERY TIME. They are thankful, grateful and happy to be there. To see us, to show us, to make US happy.*

*Realise this. Every day they have together is one day closer to the end. We can't stop time, no matter how we'd like to deny that.*

*But there ARE timeless moments, moments that can become timeless memories. Their start poses, before the music, before the dance, when they look at each other, focused; waiting as we are waiting for the music to breathe them into life and motion and the moments into memories.* 

*Those moments of stillness, each smile, each hug, as they perform together. That's their moments of greatest joy and magic. Open your eyes, understand what they're giving us.*

*Watch for it. The next time you see them on stage. Can you feel it? The magic is about to start.*",19,40,False,self,,,,,

Most of the users appear to be girls (I'm a male) and I find it extremely hard to think of a single comment. 

I do, however, want to watch TV shows that SNSD have appeared in and was wondering if anyone had a spare account lying around (that is able to view the video section). I know the 50 post requirement is there to ensure that members contribute to the forums, but it's just impossible for me.
