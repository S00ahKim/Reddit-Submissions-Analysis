Please note that it does NOT contain any collections uploaded by other people (Sky etc.), and if you dont have these already, I recommend downloading them as well.

[MEGA LINK](https://mega.co.nz/#!BYdCHJxJ!a5webGKsH19pMrsIxs0jp1wvvwpUxYcgaD0gD-4Phe0)

* The Misc folder has my favourite images which I have individually saved on my sone-travels though the interwebs.

* There are also the pictures from a couple of complete ssf threads which are in other folders.

Please follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Squilliam9), because I feel sad and pointless posting and retweeting to 1 follower :( and [Minus](http://squilliam.minus.com/) if youre interested in things I upload.

*[As a bonus](http://i.minus.com/iYul2c1gWDk7a.gif), I have included a small folder with a handful of videos, including all the Taengstagram videos (thanks to SirToki for a couple of these), plus some other short clips.*

&gt;There are a lot of pics and gifs Im not including in my collection, but many of these can be found on the accounts of:

&gt;Sky: [TaeYeon Gifs Part 1](http://sky2934.minus.com/mbngmWKmyw)

&gt;Dranko: [Taeyeon Pics Compilation part 1]( http://dranko.minus.com/mJ9IhDUGb)

&gt;Unknown: [T is for Taeyeeeeeonnnn](http://minus.com/mhsDeD8Zf2M7g)

I download from minus and other sites using Bulk Image Downloader. Save the web page, and load it in the program, it will figure the rest out.

[A big thanks to all the Sones who post and comment in this sub, especially the frequent posters!](http://i.minus.com/iHnifRR9GFC04.gif)

I had some people ask if it is still active, and yes it is!)

I have a [medium Cardinal red and a large light blue](http://imgur.com/43b8BDh) available.

To get one of these, place your order at the [KpopGear store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear) and type which one you want in the comments. It will be first come, first serve, and when the two are gone there won't be any more available for free (at least until I mess up another order!)

If you want to view SNSD specific items, [click here.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KpopGear?section_id=13716930) To view all of my items for all Kpop groups, [click here.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KpopGear)

Let me know if you have any questions! I'll make an edit when the two shirts are gone. If I have any other giveaways in the future I'll come here first since r/SNSD has been so awesome.

**Our idea**:

We will have you, the subscribers of /r/SNSD, submit imgur or minus albums of each member to us, the mods (by composing a message to ""/r/SNSD""), every Friday or Saturday depending on when you finish your album. We will compile all the albums into one post for all to enjoy and credit the album makers. We will post all the albums in a  ""weekly dose"" on a designated day (Sunday or Monday, depending on if all members have an album created yet) for each week.

We will need multiple users to gather photos/gifs of whatever member they wish and make the best albums you can! There does not need to be a theme to the albums. It is up to the user to do whatever they wish. There will be no minimum/maximum amount of pictures required.

We welcome users that have created albums to share it with that member's subreddit. (if you make a Yuri album, you may post it to /r/KwonYuri as well as submitting to the mods)

303,2013-7-9,2013,7,9,4,1hvv1k,Response to Daily Doses change,anthonyvardiz,1373313073,"I would just like to thank /u/prolyfic and the rest of the mods here on /r/SNSD for coming up with a better solution to the problem that the Daily Doses threads created. To be honest, I really like the change and I think it is for the better. However, I wanted to touch on something else.

I went back to the original post looking for volunteers and I saw a lot of downvotes on my posts as well as those who volunteered to contribute. Everyone is free to disagree with something and a change needed to be made.

However, some of the reception I got was not what I expected. We can have a civil discussion about things without deciding to just downvote and move on. If you don't like something, say something to me. Don't be a five year old and go, ""Oh this sounds like shit. DOWNVOTE!""

I know there are people who still oppose this idea, but like everyone else, I want this subreddit to be as big as it can be. Yes there were some people who opposed the project who were civil about it (big shoutout to /u/Jarzai here), but to those who weren't, realize that there is more to Reddit than hiding behind a computer screen. Foster discussion rather than simply wanting to hate on someone for an idea. Only with that can we really grow as a community.

As for this project, this is an excellent direction in my opinion. Content is added that is valued and it serves as a way for the individual member subreddits to have more content and grow as well. Glad to have the mods behind this new ""Weekly Doses"" project.

Happy Monday!",9,17

However I'm at loss of how to portray them or describe their ""character"" besides what I've seen from variety shows or interviews. Not sure if this constitutes as a ""fan-fic"" as SNSD is not the main plot nor are they the main characters, however the world will revolve around them and they will play a significant plot-driving role. 

I will appreciate it greatly if you guys can help out by describing any of the members' characters and/or their physical appearance (I'm not very good in rendering specific individuals without making it sound abstract).  I hope to be able to accurately paint them then build upon it. How fun!",23,14

I think 10 tracks with 6 covers is a reasonable number (would remove Beep Beep if needed), the original song could have a couple upbeat songs and a couple slow songs.

If you are a fan of Sunny or just want to have registration in as many snsd fansites as possible go and register. Registrations won't be open for long

---

Ok I didn't read and thought that it was like the other sites where you just register and you're done. Here though is a bit different. To view the Data board you need to answer 3 questions:

1. Your age &amp; other fan site you activate before.


2. Why you like Sunny - more than 100words in english


3. Helianthus prohibit several things. Write at least three things.


Write answers and your ID(log in ID!! no nickname'').

Send a message to master or e-mail to helianthus515@hanmail.net

I am working on some new stuff for SNSD and a lot of other groups, and the emblem designs are taking up considerable resources.

Between now and then, I'm upping the discount for all you wonderful r/SNSD folks to 20% on everything. Use coupon code **BYEBYE20** at checkout to get the discount (applies to all items, not just emblem shirts). This is a good chance to get other members if you've already ordered too!

Ok, so first up you should not pass up the opportunity to see SMENT in Gangnam. Here's a photo I took when I went last year: [SMENT](http://i.imgur.com/qWRP3.jpg). To get there, go to fucking Cheongdam Station, exit fucking 9, it should say CheongDam Community Centre. Follow [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwut9yuTXLM) fucking video, I followed it and had to walk like 20 minutes straight. BAM it's on your right, after Ferragamo and other top notch brands I cannot afford unless I sold my organs. I SAW EX-DAMN-O HERE WOWEE WOW BUT I WANTED SNSD OR F(X) AH WELL.


Visit Taeyeon fucking Kid Leader's dad's eyeglass shop in JeonJu! This is a photo I took: [This is a store](http://i.imgur.com/YfX2c.jpg). It's fucking impossible to get there. BUT JUST KIDDING. Get yo ass on the train, and take it to Express Bus Terminal station. Once you get off, ASK SOMEONE where the bus station is. I literally walked in a circle before seeing a worker and slowly through English and finding the word JeonJu in Korean online and writing it down for him, he directed me to a building hidden behind EVERYTHING ELSE. Buy a goddamn ticket, go to the gate where the bus is, and sleep. You'll have a short break 2 hours later where you can take a piss, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. Whole journey took fucking 4 hours (ONE WAY YOU WIMP). Once you get there, TAKE A FUCKING TAXI AND KEEP REPEATING SEODO (SOUNDS LIKE SO-DOE) PLAZA. This is a rural place and they will not understand long English sentences. Unless you can speak Mandarin then you can say ""Qing ni dai wo chu Seo-Do Plaza"". Remember plaza is pronounced plaJa. While you're in JeonJu, check out the JeonJu Hanok Village. Here is a photo I took of the sign: [ROCK](http://i.imgur.com/dGs2D.jpg). Here is a photo I took which makes me feel like a fotografer: [PRO](http://i.imgur.com/TpkAF.jpg). When you're at Taeyeon's dad's shop, do not ask for a photo with them, they get kind of annoyed because there's a great big sign saying they will not take photos with people. DO BRING THEM GIFTS, I brought her mom some Crabtree hand-cream and her dad a box of tea from Hong Kong! Make sure yo ass READS THIS MESSAGE TAEYEON WROTE LAST YEAR: [Message](http://i.imgur.com/Sxrl9.jpg), and write a HI HOW ARE YOU MY GODDESS message in there! Please don't rip out Taeyeon's page, because that will make you a dick. 

While in JeonJu, make sure your ass eats at a place called Kyekyeongmokchang (). It's a restaurant opened by one of Taeyeon's dad's friends, and loads of celebrities eat there. TAKE A TAXI YOU WILL NOT FIND IT. GET TAEYEON'S DAD TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE TAXI DRIVER, he was really nice and also got us a 10% discount at the restaurant (he'll obviously need to write the message and sign it). The restaurant looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/p9RAW19.jpg). Then, take photos of the signatures of SNSD muhahaha like this: [PICTURE](http://i.imgur.com/GywWk.jpg). PLEASE TRY THE SAMGYUPSAL AT THIS RESTAURANT [BEST](http://i.imgur.com/YwdCctV.jpg) SAMGYUPSAL EVER IT WAS ONLY $50USD TOTAL FOR FIVE PEOPLE, AND WE WERE ALL FUCKING FULL.

After JeonJu and SMENT (where I saw EX-fucking-O), you can check out SPAO in MyeongDong. MyeongDong is accessible by train, and it is right underneath the N Tower. SPAO looks like this: [low quality cuz iPod!](http://i.imgur.com/NidAy.jpg), and you can go to the top and go to Everysing, where you can get like $7USD albums of every SM artist! Plus, there's a lifesize Tiffany cutout: [iPod quality DERP](http://i.imgur.com/TMjMz.jpg). 


OFF-TOPIC THIS IS FOR KHUNTORIA BUTBUT IT'S SM AMIRITE? GO TO N-TOWER, TAKING PICTURE OF THE NICKHUN PUT ON: [THIS ONE I HOPE/THINK](http://i.imgur.com/vz1Sm.jpg)

Last but not fucking least, if you watched YongSeo WGM, which I KNOW YOU DID, you can visit the Miss Lee Cafe in Insadong (Insadong is fucking beautiful and artsy and kind of hipster but not really it's full of couples so if you go there with 4 other guys like I did you'll get fucking stares like you're weird or something but it's ok we had our hands). Here's a bad photo of Insadong: [INSADONG](http://i.imgur.com/mM2qz.jpg). You can find loads of fake SNSD merchandise here like posters and fake caps. Miss Lee Cafe is at the entrance of Insadong, BUT SINCE IT'S A STREET YOU MIGHT GO TO ONE END OF IT AND BE LIKE WTFBBQ WHERE IS THE CAFE, you pabu, WRONG ENTRANCE MOFO. The cafe looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0NP7O.jpg), and inside you'll find a picture of Yoona kissing the camera: [I DIED CUZ HEART YOONA](http://i.imgur.com/hqgEA.jpg) and other stuff related to YongSeo [Like this chair that they sat in and those notes above their godly heads](http://i.imgur.com/EEKmU.jpg).

OBVIOUSLY DON'T JUST GO FOR SNSD MAN KOREA IS BEAUTIFUL MAN WHY AM I TYPING IN CAPS. If you want more photos, look [here](http://imgur.com/a/xiNxf) and also [here](http://imgur.com/a/i3g5U).


If you need directions, I can give you them. Yes, I saved everything from a trip a year ago. Alternatively, you can have fun yourself and find the places by yourself, like I did. 

MAN TRY TO EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN I GAINED LIKE 10 MILLION POUNDS, IT WAS LIKE BREAKFAST, SNACK, SNACK, SNACK, LUNCH, SNACK, COFFEE, SNACK, SNACK, DINNER, SNACK, SNACK, SOJU SOJU MAKGEOLLI SNACK, FRIED CHICKEN, SOJU, BEER, KIMCHEE, SNACK, SHOWER AND SLEEP.


OH YEA DON'T FORGET TO GO TO EWHA WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY IT IS A UNIVERSITY FOR WOMEN CALLED EWHA EYECANDY MAN IT WAS AWESOME I WAS SUCH A CREEP MAN BUT THE UNI. WAS VERY PRETTY AS WERE THE PEOPLE INSIDE OF IT. 


WE ALSO WENT TO CABICABI, OH CRAZY CRAZY, HERE'S A CRAYCRAY PHOTO: [ONE](http://i.imgur.com/LDaYE5p.jpg) [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/2UwN68f.jpg) AND A FUCKING [THREE](http://i.imgur.com/lEjiztb.jpg). Flirt with the girls there. Hide your boner you loser. 


Also, go to Lotte World. Very fun, very pretty place, lots of LGs for you to leer at and flirt with. Seriously. No joke. Say hi and ask them for directions to a fucking water fountain and they'll be happy to bring you there and creepily watch you drink, then ask you in broken english where you're from and all that. Then go rollercoasting with them. 


HELL YEA.


Please ask if you want further directions or information, I have like 6gbs of photos and stuff about the Korea trip I went on last year because I'm nostalgic and like to go back and look at old photos and have one of those ""sighhhhh those were the good days"" moments like a little bitch. I forgot some pictures up there but can't remember what I should be adding, so ah well. Oh right, to be extremely creepy, you can go to Dongguk University or however you spell it and be like woohoo I am walking the grounds that SNSD have walked on when they went to class!",29,95

I see 9 absurdly cute korean girls singing and dancing in one of the most aesthetically pleasing videos I've ever seen, and the music itself is pretty catchy. 

This is so strange. Stuff like this is something a guy like me wouldn't be caught dead enjoying in the slightest. I try my hardest to justify not liking them but I can't. They're all hot and quirky, the music is catchy, and the videos are pretty effective eye candy. I may or may not have just stumbled upon a guilty pleasure, but man it feels so weird. ",67,60

About 3 months ago I started a thread on /r/SNSD (http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1atblt/usreddit_bulk_order_pure_skys_1st_photobook/)  asking anyone who may be interested in bulk ordering for Pure Sky's 1st Photobook and now they have finally arrived. This is the third bulk order that I have done on reddit and thanks to you guys we have reached a successful full order of 10 sets which gave us the cheapest EMS shipping to the US.  The calenders came faster than expected as it came after a few days of shipping (Usually it would take 2-3 weeks to ship goods to and from South Korea). **I have sent an E-Mail to those who has participated in this bulk order and please reply back so I can send you the DVDs.** 

*Thanks again redditors!*

[Picture Request]",bf1,1374644303,"I am requesting for your assistance as I have been searching on Google and this subreddit for a long time and I still cannot find it.

What I am looking for is a **timeline of the pre-debut trainees up to SNSD's debut**. 

Each trainee was represent by an arrow which shot left to right. Arrows which started from the far left were the original compilation of trainees (eg. Lee Yeon Hee, Jessica Jung, and Choi Soo Young). Arrows which diverged away from the other arrows or simply ended represented trainees whom were cut and/or left the agency (eg. Park So-Yeon, Lee Hwan Hee, Stella Kim and Seo Hyun Jin). New arrows which replace missing spots were trainees who were recruited much later (eg. Lee Soon Kyu and Heo Chan Mi).

Note: I have already seen [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/oojvc/a_brief_history_of_snsd_predebut/) and it isn't the one I was referring to. The one I saw was just a couple of months ago.",4,19

Sorry for the awful quality of the GIFs, I have no experience whatsoever with making them. On that note, how do you make yours? What tips do you have for making them? Where do you source your original image(s)/footage?

If you don't mind fellow Sone Redditors Following you, then feel free to post your details (and anything else you want people to know about you, such as your bias ^ ^ ) below as a comment and I'll edit the original post to include you! Feel free to Follow as many or as few people as you'd like, even if you don't want to add your own details. Of course if you don't want to Follow them after a while then just Unfollow them, no hard feelings. :P It's just to get us to feel a little less anonymous and more like a member of an intimate family.

---

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (**Downvotes will not be counted**)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Tiffany** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.

----

###***Special Event:***

* Since it's the girls' anniversary, I wanted to have a little contest on the side. A shout out to the graphic designers (or to anyone who wants to participate :P), you guys can create either a **banner** or a **side pic** for the subreddit!
* The same rules apply for this portion of the 'contest', but with one small change, only one sidebar and banner picture will be chosen for their anniversary (the anniversary banner and sidebar picture with the most upvotes will be chosen).
* If you're submitting one of each, post them in separate posts.
* For the banner, the dimensions must be at least 1366 x 150, but no more than 2000 x 150, this is to ensure that it fits the majority of our users' screens (sorry to the 1024's, 1366's are just more common :C). It **must** be in a PNG format! JPGs will be scoffed at!
* It has to be all 9 girls and remember to adjust to the screen, mainly make sure that the 9 girls are at least visible for 1366 x 768 monitors.
* Please remember to adjust for the [Reddit user header](http://i.imgur.com/rLJ2J.jpg). It does overlap with the picture, so adjust accordingly.
* For the anniversary sidebar pic, the same rules apply (300 x 360, PNG and it must have all the members, etc).
* The winning banner will be used for the entire month of August, the sidebar picture will be used on the day of.
* You are allowed to add text, something like 'Happy Anniversary' or something similar to it. Don't go crazy with the text though :P
* [An example of a banner](http://i.imgur.com/Lv9FR.png).

If you want tank tops, women's sizes, or larger sizes please pm me on here or send a message through the store site. I can get all of those but I need to make a custom listing for each. 

It's somewhat irrelevant to r/SNSD, but I also launched a new [f(x) shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/157864126/fx-fx-pink-tape-rum-pum-pum-pum-heart) and a new [After School shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/157836288/after-school-anarchy-logo-k-pop-t-shirt?).

Thanks again, and as always if you have questions don't hesitate to ask!
