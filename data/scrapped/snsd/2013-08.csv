I'm going down to KCON later this month and am about to book flight tickets from Friday to Monday of that weekend. Today is the last day to book if you want cheap tix (80 bucks each way from SJC to LAX). After today it'll be over $100 each way.

That said, I was wondering if people are roadtripping down? Hopefully, there are enough people here who are going and we can just arrange rentalcar + hotel pricing together to make things cheap for the rest of us. It'd be nice if people who do plan on going and don't have filled cars/fully arranged plans could chime in. :)

It was more or less a fluke that he became so popular with Gangnam Style by way of YouTube.  The song is not much different than the usual bass-thumping, catchy, lyrical, electronic hits that make up a majority of the songs on his previous 5 albums.  For some reason, Americans noticed Gangnam style, and it quickly went from the new [Tunak Tunak Tun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9qvCTdBLDs) to the most blah blah blah blah YouTube ever.


SNSD has turned out a number of hits, one of which held meme status before Psy's mockery of poseurs.  Even among those who never became SONE's, Gee sparked a brief wave of images, quotes, and misheard lyric transcriptions.  Why didn't the girls catch on with the Hollywood elite and professional musicians alike?


My guess is that Americans simply like artists more than performers.  Now, I'm a SONE too, so hear me out before getting your silk screened ""9"" panties in a twist  (is that just me?  oops).  


The hallyu movement in general seems to have difficulty infecting the United States despite the attempts made by the likes of BoA, Wonder Girls, 2NE1, and so on.  What makes Psy different?  He composes his own music.

*""But, MisterFlibble!!!  Beyonce, Beiber, and One Derpection don't write their own music!""*

This is true, but most Americans aren't aware of this, or at least, they fail to make that perception.


One of the criticisms K-pop receives from the Migug masses is it's artificial nature... that it's simply a Korean copy of the American pop style and sound (of a decade or more ago, at that).


I don't think that the girls' success in the states will rely so much on the sound as will getting their hands a little dirty.  You see, nearly all the massive hits the girls' have put out in the past were bought by SM Entertainment from *someone*. (This is different from groups like 2NE1 where their music is at least largely composed by other artists within YG)

As we see the girls begin to write more of the lyrics as with songs like XYZ, and Fany's contribution on The Boys, they may have a better shot.


Now, we have Teddy Riley involved with their next anticipated album.  I bet many of you pretty much forgot all about Pussy Cat Dolls until you read this sentence.  Remember them?  As far as making something that sells, he's a good composer.. But what I think will really get SNSD noticed, is seeing Seo and Sica on piano, seeing Tae belt out a rock anthem, get Hyo and Yuri busting moves and rhymes... even if they don't write whatever they put out themselves, at least make it *look* like it.


Granted, as a SONE, I will no doubt like whatever they release, but I think that to steal the hearts of the more shallow Americans without resorting to thongs and boob jobs, the girls just need to be allowed to be themselves.  SM (or Universal, or whatever) needs to loosen their shackles a bit and let them express themselves more.


They are already so appreciated in the East for both their distinct personalities and their catchy hits, but I think allowing the songs and personalities to finally become acquainted with each other would have a shot at elevating the girls from representatives of Korea to ambassadors of planet earth.

However, I managed to turn this into an opportunity, and designed this setup which I'm pretty proud of. ^ ^

http://i.imgur.com/ABGXkUq.jpg

The Home page in the centre is TaeNy, but I've set up the left page to be Eye-smile Tiffany, with 3 Instant Messaging apps (Fany is chatty), the Settings app (Manager Hwang), and Maps (American-Korean International).

On the right page, I've got Goldilocks Taeyeon, with Camera, Album and Instagram (Taeng likes drawing and is on Instagram), the SNSD Lyrics app (the vocalist, our OST Queen), and Chrome (eh, I had to have it somewhere).

This way, when I look for a chat app, I'll know to look towards the left Fany page, and when I look for a photography/lyrics app, I'll look towards the right Taeng page. :D

So as you can see, everything does happen for a reason, as long as you shoehorn enough reasons into it. :P

I can't seem to find a direct youtube link or anything, but I've tried to copy the link in spotify, so maybe this will work.

The song is Lotus - Act from the album Blur.

The line first comes in around 1:40 and is featured several times throughout the song as a refrain of sorts.

First of all, I'd like to say that I really like the content of this subreddit, people stay polite most of the time and there are very few trolls. If there are trolls, people downvote them quickly enough to make their posts invisible.

However, I've been lurking for a few months and not really contributing a lot to this subreddit. I'd like to change that and made this post to find out what kind of content people like and would like to see more of in this subreddit.

Some people might enjoy photo albums in imgur/minus, gifs, Youtube videos of performances, in-depth discussions about members or the group,... There is a really big chance these will be reposts or stuff people here will already have seen though, because I have only been a SONE for a few months and still finding new stuff that's a few years old every day.

I won't bother talking about the Instagram/Weibo stuff people have been discussing about lately, so please refrain from discussing that in this thread. There is another topic dedicated to that already.",44,12,False,self,,,,,

**Disclaimer**: While I don't believe they are touchy subjects and you guys all seem so nice and welcoming, I've noticed in the comments that a few people can get really protective and there have been some bickering here and there. I don't intend to be creepy or stalkerish in ANY way; I'm just genuinely, innocently curious. I don't want to step on any toes.

Okay, so:

* What is SNSD's net worth? Is it safe to assume that each member is easily a multi millionaire? Which member is paid the most (or has the most outside endeavors)? What is their contract like with SM, how are they paid? Do they have individual agents or is everything managed by SM and any and all appearances are governed by SM? 

* Where do they all live? I know they lived a dorm together when they debuted, do they all still live together or by themselves? Do they all live in mansions in Korea? Hah. Do their parents? (I assume family is well taken care of)

* Can they all drive or do they mostly get chauffeured everywhere? What kind of cars do they drive?

* Where does SNSD rank in Kpop group popularity in Korea? Are they ever seen randomly on the street or would they get completely mobbed in a heartbeat?

* How closely monitored is their image? Do they have restrictions on certain things as to not tarnish their brand or image?

* Are they at all allowed to date? I've heard that Hyoyeon is publicly dating someone. Have the other members revealed current or past relationships? SNSD and K-pop idols in general seem to have very passionate fans and I heard relationship rumors sort of ignite bad things. (Wasn't Jessica's sister chased off twitter because fans thought she was dating some other idol? I don't know maybe I'm misinformed). Perhaps if a group's fanbase was developed with an 'innocence' image, then them all having boyfriends gets people riled up and envious/jealous.

* Last one, why isn't the song ""Beginning"" on any studio album? It seems to only be listed on the [""Into the New World"" single](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_New_World_(song) yet ""Honey"" is on the first album. Same goes for the few songs on the ""Tell Me Your Wish"" EP. Oh well.

I apologize if these are bad questions, it was just a random stream of thought.

Thanks for your time.",60,23,False,self,,,,,

What most of you wouldn't be aware of is that i was about 3 bottles deep into a case of wine while watching the cricket till 4am. Now obviously that doesn't excuse my behaviour but i thought i would give you a little background. 

Obviously we are not all going to agree on every issue here, and thats fine, infact its probably a good thing because otherwise all this sub would be is pleasantries and platitudes and nothing constructive would ever get done. I went a little too far with the sarcasm and childishness last night and i would like to apologise for that. 

If we can look for any positives from my last few posts, its that we now have the ability to correctly tag posts which will aid in searching for what you want, regardless of the title. 

Anyway, i just woke up with a hangover and its 1:30pm here in Sydney so i'm going down to the beach and have some breakfast to recover.

I recently went to Lima, Peru and did some mission/volunteer work in the poor areas.  I went to a primary school, where the walls were all blue, there were kids flocking the staircases and balconies, excited to see the foreigners come with presents and fun filled things to do instead of school work. The school probably had 200 kids in it, ranging from Kindy to Grade 6.

http://i.imgur.com/qaqygCH.jpg

The first thing we had to do at the school was to re-enact a parable from the Bible, then play with them. I was taken upstairs to Grade 4, where there was a class filled with kids with bright eyes and adorable smiles on their faces. They were all sitting on their little chairs, looking tidy with their uniform and smiling with all (or most) of the white gleaming teeth. It was adorable. After acting out a parable, I had the opportunity to talk to some of the kids and the teacher.

(credits to my friend who cant take photos)


The teacher stared at me (because I was the only asian in the group) and told me, in broken english, Yoona. Girls Generation. Come here to work. I stared at him. Yoona? As in SNSD Yoona? Why would she come here? So I asked him again, are you sure? Yoona from Girls Generation. The pretty korean girl. And he said yes. He had a big smile on his face as he talked about Yoona and what she did at the school during her time over here. So, I found out that Yoona from Girls Generation had travelled halfway across the world, to an area filled with poor people, to help out and play with kids that are less fortunate than her, despite her high status in the real world. I was in shock. I couldnt believe it. The teacher told me as well, Many many koreans come here and help us, they are wonderful people. I love Koreans.

I was and am still in shock. I went back to my hotel that night and tried searching up news articles about Yoona and her volunteer work in Peru, yet there was none. So (from what I know) I think Yoona went to do volunteer work for herself and for others, not for the public to know.

Yeah I just wanted to share it with yall.

As the title states, I'm looking for some ideas for a SNSD tattoo. After much thought, I've decided that I would really like to get a SNSD tattoo, since the group has become a big part of my life and has personally changed my life for the better and I would like to get something that will always be a part of me to resemble that.

That being said, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas or suggestions they could give me, I was originally thinking of getting the IGAB logo, or possibly just the groups name in Hangul, but I'm still not 100% sure what I want.

Ideally I would want it to be something that I could incorporate my own ideas into to make it more meaningful, but I would love to hear what other people would suggest to help point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance!",23,10,False,self,,,,,

&gt;I have always wanted to say this but it wasn't easy for me to say; thank you to the fans for taking wonderful photos of me whenever and wherever. I know that you always try to catch me in the best light possible even if I am scowling. I can't say this properly in writing but I am so thankful that I come close to tearing up everytime! Sometimes when I look at your photos I can see the affection that you have for me. There is a clear difference between taking a picture of just Taeyeon [with the flash on] and really trying to take a good picture even if it's just a strand of hair. I can feel it.. That's why I feel so thankful yet so sorry at the same time. It would be best if no one gets hurt physically or emotionally in the process of taking pictures since we can't help but worry for one another \^^ aigoo What am I really trying to say??? Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, photos or not, I am really thankful for all your love and support. To be honest, I want to learn how to take photos from Sones keke. How is it that you are able to make me seem so fresh, lively, and well rested?? How????????? Everyone must be good at taking selcas right?? Ah I'm curious now... Sone Selca... Haha everyone, even though I have a hard time expressing myself and can be a bit brusque, I am always looking for chances to express myself. It's just that my personality is like an ant\^^ I wish we can meet like this for a long, long time\^\^ Sa. um... Do you love me??????????? hehehe I love you Sone From the airplane, Gwing Taeng goong to Sones

* *TL NOTE:* ""Gwing Taeng goong"" = what she decided to call herself this time. not sure if there's any other meaning.

* *TL NOTE2:* ""Sa. um... Do you love me?"" = she starts to say ""saranghaeyo"" ('I love you' in Korean but she changes that to ""saranghaeyo na?"" = 'do you love me' because she has the ""personality of an ant""

* *TL NOTE3:* ~~""personality of an ant"" I don't know. don't ask. ._.~~

/u/KoreanKid11: ""Personality of an ant"" is a phrase in Korean which means that the person is hard-working.

***
*Alternate translation by @kymmie*

&gt;There's something that I've always been wanting to say but couldn't really bring up easily. No matter when or where, to capture my appearance so beautifully, I'm really thankful to our fans. Even when I'm frowning, you manage to capture the prettiest shot in that moment. Your sincerity, effort and the affection you have towards me, I'm so thankful to the point where I cannot express it using words and it makes me tear up! Sometimes when I look at the photos you have taken [for/of me], I know where the focus of your love lies! Whether it's just simply quickly taking a photo of the woman Taeyeon with a flash or whether you're being sincere even when just taking a picture of a strand of hair, it's really different. I can feel it all, everyone.. Because of that, as much as I am thankful, I feel just as sorry towards everyone. It would really be best if there were no dangerous situations or that nobody get hurts emotionally when we meet [like this] because we can't help but worry for each other\^^ Aigoo. What am I trying to say exactly??? Anyway in conclusion, photos or whatever aside, I'm saying that I'm always thankful for all your affection and love  Personally, I'd like to learn how to take photos from SONEs keke. How do you manage to make me look like such an energetic, fresh and lively child?? How do you take it like that??? All of you must take such good selcas too right?? Ah I'm curious... SONE selca... Haha everyone, even though I'm not good at expressing myself and might seem emotionless, please don't forget that I'm always looking for chances to express myself [to you]. It's because my personality is like an ant\^^ I wish we can meet each other with pleasant moods for a really really long time\^\^ Lo-\*. Umm.. do you love me???????? hehehehehe I love you SONE  From Kwing Taeng Goong** in the plane to SONEs


* *She wanted to say ""I love you"" but stopped, I think.

Taeyeon's comment translated by @d0ngie:
&gt;Oh and\^^ I'm saying this just in case you might misunderstand why I wrote such a long paragraph. It's not because something happened today or I got angry or anything like that!! Haha it was because I was really thankful to all the fans that came out to see me off even though I wasn't with any of my members

As you can see she is denying the rumor or she might be covering it up. It might be because it's too early to reveal the information about it or because SM wants to reveal it in a more official way. It might be because SSF were misled. At this point only time will tell.

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (**Downvotes will not be counted**)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Hyoyeon** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.
