WOWOW will also air on November 8, 3 PM their concerts from their first concert in 2011 to their newest one. There will be also a live video reflecting on SNSD's history, and how their precious their time probably was.",10,21

140,2014-11-13,2014,11,13,2,2m38s8,Keep the Dream Alive,[deleted],1415813398,"I was just watching Girls Generation - Live at Madison Square Garden. And that realization that i'll never see the 9 perform hits harder then before. Like i knew it before and heard it. But that moment when you feel it.

So then i'm thinking about my 1 post before where I posted about what jessicas departure was really about. Got some pretty positive feedback and reasoning. We discerned that jessicas post snsd plans met heavy resistance via her exit due to her company SM, or her members, or some combination.

But this post is about preventive maintenance. This dead period that we get once in a while with snsd activities needs to be viewed differently. I mean I think of all the groups that go through member changes. And how lots of groups within their opening years have members file lawsuits and leave. Lots of scenarios really. But I simply don't care about those groups. I like my groups. Snsd. Sistar. And i liked kara only cause of nicole and now shes gone. Her pop career cut short cause of a company. That girl was pop star incarnate i swear to god.

Anyway maybe snsd will continue like normal like one of those groups. Maybe not. Its what, 8 years in? This year was filled with boyfriend reveals. Lots of press on the end of snsd feelings. And we're wrapping up the year with a member kicked out. Which in a way is better then them leaving? Press point of view is jessica disobeyed and gets boot. What that means is, instead of a member leaving of their own accord, which would promote a line of thinking of ""the girls are moving on"". Its basically in the same category of distancing the group from the member like its a lawsuit. So the group continues on like its healthy and nothing happened. But i don't expect anyone to read into it as much as me? So i expect thoughts of the end are present whether she left or got booted.

ANYWAY! My real point and request. Is that whoever is much deeper in the fandom. And has connections that lead to fans even in south korea. Put out a word that says we want to see snsd. Theres always a piece of news (most times i wouldn't call it news but it shows up there on the internet) where it quotes nietzens. Nietzens say this or that. Its quick and to the point. ""We still want to see snsd."" Give them shows/work whatever. 

I just don't want to wake up one day with a headline emerging from one of our dead periods. That says ""snsd disbands"". A little communication would go a long way with what these peoples plans are. It doesn't even take much. In one sense its stalkerish like ""let us know what your plans are, you people who don't know me or speak english 10,ooo miles from where i live.""

But as a fan. You can say ""i want to see acdc or police, lets get tickets."" and u can look up when their coming. You can do this like a year in advance.  its harder cause we're in america for these asian groups but i don't think you can even do that in asia. They micromanage their groups daily. Stress them out. And yet they can't plan a concert 1 year in advance. They spam in japan calling it a world tour. But japan is easy and its for licking their wounds when they fuck up elsewhere all year. I'm not even exaggerating, they fly the idols on planes back and forth constantly without a care to the idols stress level or efficient calculated planned order of events. 

ANYWAY!!! i'm sorry this turned into a rant about my distaste for music company management in SK. We want to see snsd still. Get the word out. Thanks.",1,0

 the thing is, my mom is an alcoholic. im the youngest child but i have a big sense to protect the others. so whenever my mom drank i made absolutely sure no one would find out about it. i wanted to hide the truth from my brother  at least, since i cant be saved any longer.
my life has not been easy, every since a little girl. dead father, bullied, etc. snsd has helped a lot in making me smile (: only a few weeks ago my pedopsychytrist made me tell my mother about the drinking problem. i thought she accepted it well. but since a few days ago i kept seeing her with the drunk eyes. so tonight i waited until i was home alone and searched her room. i found a bottle of wiine. 

im pretty much having a melt down right now. so i really need to get everything off my chest but i need somewhere to do that. i write a lot, but i want to, anounimously, confess this. 

so i wanted to ask you if you know any site where i can confess this stuff anonimously, but a site about this kind of life problems situations, where i can be heard and talk to people with this kind of situations. ive tried to search but there was nothing like hear and be heared. believe me, i wouldnt even dare to ask for such a thing if i wasnt at my limit.

im really sorry for making some of you reading this, and because it has nothing to do with the reddit i will erase this post as soon as i get a good answer. thank you so much. and im sorry. plz have a nice day! (:

So, I'm not actually sure if Sones outside of Japan are eligible to join the lottery portion of the contest, but it doesn't hurt to try. All they mentioned in the announcement is that they won't be responding to any inquiry questions.

Anyway, I'm curious about what /r/SNSD's predictions are! Comment with yours!",7,16

The translated interview can be found on Mystarmyangel's [Tumblr](http://mystarmyangel.tumblr.com/). Copy paste of the interview:

There is such a saying: How one lives his/her life and his/her thinking that are reflected on ones face is the best work of ones life

24 years old YoonA has a face that is somewhat different from what we expected. Of course her image is the same as she has onscreen, her clear skin is as beautiful, and her face also gives us the thinking so this is how small a fist sized face looks like. But we thought the twinkling her will just be bright and cute, but, how should i put it. should i say from her face i can feel there is a deep story behind? As the visual of our nations girl group, and also the goddess of 65000 soldiers, even though YoonA was oozing with a million volt of charms with all smiles and laughters, she also gives off in-depth mature expressions through her eyes, the fragrance of a girl and a woman switching with each other can be seen on her smiling face throughout the photoshoot.

SNSDs YoonA has been enjoying a break with a lot of freedom and leisure that she ever has since debut after the end of &lt;Mr. Mr.&gt; promotions. 

&gt;""It is such a bliss lying on bed listening to singers such as Kim Dong Ryul, Urban Zakapa. Hanami (Flower viewing) and backpacking trip that i have never experience before is something i wanted to try if i get the chance to, but as of  now, i do not have the thought that i am very determined to do it yet. So even though i do envy friends of my age occasionally, but i also understand that there is no way one can have everything. During a broadcast programme in the past, i had an experience of working, it is even more tiring as compared to rushing schedules. Through that experience i understand that even if i do not have as much freedom as others, it is also not easy to be able to do things that i like and also gain a lot of things out of it, so i am even more thankful now.

Actress YoonA is expected to participate in the Korean Chinese movie Goodbye Ani. 

&gt;As of now, the specific filming period has not been decided yet. In actual fact i debut first as an actress before i debut as a singer. Acting is the field that i will ultimately want to focus on and the field that i have desire in. Even if it is roles that have little screentime, if i am able to learn many things from the outstanding sunbaes, i have wish to play a role too. Recently i watched &lt;Pretty Woman&gt;, it left a very deep impression for me, if i tell you the movie was filmed around the year i was born, can you believe it? I wish to encounter a film like this, a film that still leaves a deep impression in people memory no matter how long time has passed.

More like a (blood) type A, rather than type B 

&gt;""I  feel that it is both my strength and weakness that my personality is not a typical type B. I am clear in what i like, so i am able to distinguish clearly between likes and dislikes. But when it comes to things out of my field, i become extremely careful and indecisive. I am a sensitive person by nature, but through SNSDs activities, i have become more outgoing. In the past i  was very hurt by the negative remarks that i read from the net, and i suffered a lot too. But people around me told me it is impossible for everyone to like and view me in good light, and ask me to cheer up, with their help, i gradually become stronger.

Fashion Star 

&gt;""I am the type that will fix a date for shopping and buy everything i need at one go. Im not sure if it is because i wore too many cute outfits on stage, i tend to pick outfits that are more comfortable and simple when i go shopping. I also try to seek for a style that suits me after looking at paparazzi photos of Hollywood stars. My overly thin body makes me feel inferior, so i am trying very hard to gain weight, but it is really not an easy task""

* Girl's Generation the first album

I know up to now, this is more of a bragging post but here comes the point where i could have some help.

Where to buy CDs, DVDs online? (what I have by now, I got in Korea &amp; Thailand)

Which albums you think are the most difficult to get hold of (if any). I'd imagine the 10 versions of IGaB could be tricky and so im planning to order the 10 versions at once.

Any suggestions, tips, links I could get from other collecting SONEs is appreciated.

The ring blocks her nose and mouth.  But I've watched so many SNSD videos, it looks to be Jessica.  It looks like she is in a white lace top with some black.  She disappears along with her dad, half way through the third fight and doesn't seem to be back.

I don't have a screen grab, but I bet if you were watching the fight and were looking at the pretty ladies in the audience, that pretty lady was definitely Jessica.  She sits in the row behind Arnold and Sylvester, in the far left near the pole between an older asian guy with glasses and some older white guy.

LoL.  My friends were all like, oh this girl is hot and this one is pretty, pointing out all the girls in audience.  And I was just thinking to myself, that's my Jessica.",7,27

370,2014-11-28,2014,11,28,6,2nm3gu,A fangirl gifted Taeyeon an eggplant today,arthurmauk,1417125544,"So everyone enjoys the Sonedom in different ways, be it through songs, music videos, performances, shows, interviews, fan art/fics and everything else the girls do to brighten up our day. One way I enjoy the fandom is through the random events that happen to them and their hilarious reactions in response, so here's what happened today that I thought was really funny:

&gt; SNSD were at a fansign today at Lotte. In the middle of the fansign, a girl with a bag walks up to Taeyeon and says: ""Let's try this!"" whilst taking an eggplant out of her bag. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Taeyeon is understandably bewildered at the gift being presented to her - ""Eh?""](http://i.imgur.com/x5J8oFL.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; The fan exclaims: ""  !"" which means ""Take my heart!""
&gt; 
&gt; It turns out that she crafted an elaborate pun because the ""/gaji/take"" can also mean ""eggplant"", but [Taeyeon is probably still too surprised to get it: ""What is this... is it for me?""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3cIDu1CcAE1P3y.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; The fan carefully says: ""No... I don't mean that I'm literally giving you an eggplant...""
&gt; 
&gt; Taeyeon reassures her, saying: ""It's okay, please give it to me, is this a real eggplant?""
&gt; 
&gt; The fan responds: ""Yes!""
&gt; 
&gt; Later on she reveals that she also got herself an eggplant so that she could have couple eggplants with Taeyeon lmao... XD

The fandom is now having fun with the story and speculating about what Taeyeon might do with the eggplant or how she'll use it on Tiffany. :P There are people shipping [TaeyeonxEggplant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3cseZlCAAApRCR.png) and Jellywing's drawn a chibi version of the events: http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/6816b8e1gw1empzgmnniaj20dw0mxgns.jpg I myself [bought and cooked some eggplants. :9](http://instagram.com/p/v6uBNOJqSi/?modal=true) Hope you enjoyed this episode in the hilarious saga that is the Soshi life, til next time! :)",6,61

I've never cared for the color explosion MVs and Galaxy Supernova in my ignorance had me worried about people with epilepsy. After the September separation I joked about a break up song (for jessi) that i actually did kind of barely start. Its applicable but not specific. With or without Jess, I, as many others liekly, dont want SNSD to act like nothing happened; including musically. that is almost assuredly SMs plan. whether to keep acting like the NGG or Queens and have color explosions. there have been a lot of talk about bringing back 2009 when they exploded (as 9) in the fandom and a lot of nostalgia. I, greedily was wondering more about bringing back 08 and before. not musically but to try to reunite them and their forging. Might that at all be a viable musical direction? I know the black ocean is taboo and bringing it up at all is probably a bad idea; but a part of me still wants it done. Ive wanted them to talk about it before, but what about a MV with them each alone then together singing to a black background (just empty and dark not a recreation but still an obvious allusion). What about a MV inspired by their training days? have the NGG scrubbing toilets in a video? Since people are causing for their demise. I dont know if its telling their story or getting back to their height by recreating their foundation. Without thinking it out i like it one several levels and at least can kick cliches to justify it in my brain. i know it doesnt seem like its something that is ready to go over well, but i want to see it more than ever. even if it is as 8. Especially since people are calling for their demise and that the bond, over anything else maybe, seems to be what is perceived to be damaged. im probably just babbling. sorry I just like the idea of with all that the idol life has come to represent, SNSD showing a more humble on screen image. (not saying they arent humble, they show it in shows. also i know other groups have done it some. I cant really remember a SM group really doing it though. I am probably just tired and forgetting things.

tl;dr Jessica bias wants to see SNSD scrubbing toilets and crying... wait... not like  that!",3,0

It's awesome quality -- probably the best I'll ever find -- but I made the incredibly stupid mistake of downloading the raw Korean version. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that there are very few places to find this show subbed in English online and even harder to find one whose quality or translation isn't absolute shit. 


Basically, all I need is for someone to link me somewhere that I can watch/download the complete show with English subtitles without dealing with a resolution or translation that makes me wanna vomit. Even better, if someone, by some miracle, had the complete series with the subtitles in .srt, .ass, or any other subtitle format, and if that person would allow me to download *just* the subtitle files, that would be absolutely fucking awesome.


I used a torrent magnet from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/th2rain/status/525160606366568450) to download the complete raw series, in case someone wants that. In hindsight, I should've known it had no English subs considering the whole Twitter page is in Korean.",7,14

On the second line, it literally says ""SNSD Taeyeon solo album &amp; Red Velvet [comeback]"".

Of course, I've taken this with a grain of salt, and I think it's highly likely this is fake, but I thought it might make a good discussion. What would you guys think of Taeyeon releasing a solo album? Would you rather have a group album instead or are you just down for whatever future music comes out from any of the members (Jessica included)?

Edit: Personally, I'd prefer a group album just because it's been so long since their last one.",15,18
