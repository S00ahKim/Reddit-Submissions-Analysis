In 2005, SM Entertainment debuted a large boy group, 'Super Junior,' and then proceeded to plan a similar large girl group counterpart. SM put together a showcase comprised of internal trainees; most were veteran trainees and the total number of girls featured was 11.

[Original compilation of the 11](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BGbOvdFtI/AAAAAAAAAf8/T5yLXSsMWH4/s640/1.jpg)

(Clockwise from top left: Lee Yeon Hee, Hong Bo Ra, Bae Seok Min, Zhang Li Yin, Jessica Jung, Kim Ye Jin, Seo Ju Hyun, Im Yoon Ah, Choi Soo Young, Kwon Yu Ri, Kim Hyo Yeon)

**Notes:**

Currently an actress: Lee Yeon Hee

Zhang Li Yin is currently a solo singer with SM Entertainment.

Jessica Jung was a Korean American Trainee.

Leader: Lee Yeon Hee (born in 1988)

Maknae: Kim Ye Jin (born in 1993; only in grade 3 when she joined the company).

---

**And then the first revision began:**

IN: Seo Hyun Jin, Park So Yeon, Stella Kim, Jang Ha Jin, Lee Hwan Hee

OUT: Lee Yeon Hee, Hong Bo Ra, Bae Seok Min, Zhang Li Yin, Kim Ye Jin

[The revised 11](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BGnDE8_YI/AAAAAAAAAgE/qk_weKe48Ls/s640/2.jpg)

**Notes:**

Maknae: Seo Ju Hyun and Lee Hwan Hee (both born in 1991)

---

**Second revision of the group:**

[Still 11 group members](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BG4R6eINI/AAAAAAAAAgM/aWz0x06URwQ/s640/3.jpg)

With Seo Hyun Jin and Lee out of the running, SM invited a regional trainee Kim Tae Yeon and American Stephanie Hwang (who at the time had only trained for 2 years). SM initially planned to stick to these 11 girls and actually took some still cuts/pics of them.
This line-up is probably the most well-known line-up for the so-called female counterpart of Super Junior. At this point, netizens started calling this project group as Super Girls. In fact, SM Entertainment initially planned to debut this 11-member girl group. They even already took group picture of them. 

[Here's a group photo](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BOM-p6pqI/AAAAAAAAAgk/et1rkpvDWCU/s640/2ykxbhx.jpg)

Initial roster:

Vocal Line: Park So Yeon, Kim Tae Yeon, Jessica Jung, Stephanie Hwang, Seo Ju Hyun, Stella Kim

Dance Line: Kim Hyo Yeon, Kwon Yu Ri, Choi Soo Young, Im Yoon Ah

Visual Line: Jessica Jung, Stella Kim, Im Yoon Ah, Jang Ha Jin

**Notes:**

Stephanie Hwang was a Korean American Trainee.

Leader: Park So Yeon (Born 1987)

Maknae: Seo Ju Hyun (Born 1991)

---

**The third revision:**

IN: Lee Soon Kyu, Lee Hwan Hee, Heo Chan Mi

OUT: Stella Kim, Jang Ha Jin

[12 group members this time](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BHCKIXveI/AAAAAAAAAgU/zK6tlTx9TNs/s640/4.jpg)

SM initially planned to debut with the 11 girls from revision 2. However, Lee Soon Kyu was recruited as an additional trainee thanks to rave recommendation from SM singer Ayumi, and added another trainee named Heo Chan Mi. They re-recruited Lee Hwan Hee as well. During this process, Stella Kim, once highly touted prospect of SM, was cut mainly due to her lack of dancing skills.

[A group picture of the 12](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BQAwu-ASI/AAAAAAAAAgs/RgzGiJ5FiK8/s640/2prxziw.jpg)

**Notes:** 

Lee Soon Kyu was originally a trainee with another company; she transferred over to SM after an audition.

Leader: Park So Yeon (born 1987)

Maknae: Heo Chan Mi (born 1992)

---

**And of course, the 9 who we know and love today:**

[Debut pictures](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_T2mDIwIs4uI/S0BHVid_zOI/AAAAAAAAAgc/nRnUxib3c3k/s640/5.jpg)

OUT: Park So Yeon, Lee Hwan Hee, Heo Chan Mi

After numerous revisions, the remaining trainees were put through what was ultimately a final audition process; SM had decided to cut the number of girls in the group from 12 to 9. The final audition resulted in Park So Yeon, Lee Hwan Hee, and Heo Chan Mi being cut, resulting in the current 9 members.

The 9 remaining girls were then officially named ""So Nyuh Shi Dae"" and took official profile pictures.
