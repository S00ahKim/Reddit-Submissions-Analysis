So far only 2 songs have held their pre-tournament position, Love Sick at 27 and Into The New World in 3rd, the top 2 slots could remain unchanged depending on the results of the grand final for which the voting remains open until noon GMT on 3rd December, [go here to vote if you haven't already](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/143my7/the_best_snsd_song_contest_the_grand_final/)

A big thank you to everyone who has voted in this contest in any of the rounds, there's too many of you to thank by name and extra special thanks to anyone who has voted in every round.

Please let me know in the comments what you thought of the contest, anything that you wish was done differently, things that could be improved upon or things you liked about the format so that any such contests in the future can be even better. My mind is already running through possible ways of running it next year, which hopefully will be graced by songs from 3 new albums (Girls and Peace and potential Korean and English releases in 2013) to make it even bigger and better than this one.

Also feel free to discuss below your thoughts on the results themselves for example any songs that you think ended up in a position they shouldn't have, regardless of whether that's too high or too low. Any of your favourites that that exited early leaving you disappointed or any that you were pleasantly surprised by how far they got.

On Dec 23 I'm going on a trip to a local orphanage and I chose to sponsor a 13 yo girl who wanted a Girl's Generation CD for Christmas. I'm having a little dilemma. I live in Tokyo, Japan and I'm unsure of which CD I should get her. I want to get her multiple CD's, however the group I'm going with specifically said that the amount I could spend on the child was $45 USD. The thing is I absolutely LOVE SNSD and I want to spoil her with a bunch of CD's and merch. I'm just super unsure of what to get her. Any suggestions?

**TL;DR** Going on a trip to an orphanage and I'm not sure which CD's to get the child I'm sponsoring.

**Edit:** Gonna find out the information for the orphanage today and call them to see if I can ask her what her favorite songs are and which CD's she already has.",19,41

Upon further investigation, I noticed that Amazon has a few copies listed on their website but are going for 130 dollars.

I'll ask Amazon if this is for the limited edition press so that I know whether or not to bite on this price.

Here's the wikipedia article that lists the contents of the DVD's/Blu-Rays and also what is packed into the special edition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation_Complete_Video_Collection

On a side note: If other people have bought or are planning to buy limited editions and manage to snag a Yoona pen (assuming I don't get one in mine), I'll be happy to trade you if I happen to snag your bias! 

I'll see what Amazon says, and get back to you guys when I get a better idea as to what versions are being sold there.",12,16

If you've seen my post with the Sunny Medic, you'll know I'm working on a Fany Medic and Yoona Marine.  I started on Fany's and noticed in a lot of her photos her head is either tilted or she is positioned at an angle.  I have gone through about 5 drafts and nothing is really working for me.

So if anyone has a picture of her looking straight at the camera, her head not tilted, and the image is AT LEAST 2MP large. It would be a great help.


Thanks for you time, much love :)

EDIT: Just wanted to thank everyone who has took the time to search for pictures. Please don't take too much out of your free time to be searching for pictures for me.  But if you do find one don't be scared to post it :)

To give everyone an idea what I'm looking for I'm posting up the stock photos of the medic and Sunny as per snsdktf's request.

&gt;A source revealed to Starnews, ""Girls' Generation has been working on their Korean album in the midst of their Japan activities. There is a high possibility that Girls' Generation's official 4th album will be releasing in early January.


&gt;A source from SME stated, ""As the title song has been decided on already, work on the official album is close to being finished. We are currently deciding on the final released date. It's a bit early to be answering anything about releasing an album overseas.""

*Edit* I couldn't find the new album so I just went ahead with these. I'll probably end up going back and giving it to her when i can get my hands on it.

*Edit2* Ill take pictures of when I deliver the gifts to her and her reaction for you all! I'm looking forward to it!

282,2012-12-17,2012,12,17,7,14ymb1,Something cool to try while watching the I AM: SMTown Blu-Ray Live Performance,keithmsf,1355697451,"Last night I finally got around to watching the entire live disc of the I AM: SMTown Blu-Ray and while messing with my surround sound system noticed something really awesome.

With the receiver set to DTS, I lowered the levels of everything except the center channel speaker and it allowed me to hear just the main mic audio from the girls. No backing track, no crowd and very little of the instrumental track. 

It was really cool to hear just the raw vocals of the girls. We all know Taeyeon is awesome, but listening to her like this was jaw-dropping. Jessica and Seohyun were incredible as well. Kind of disappointed that almost all of Yuri's vocals were lip-synched though.

Just thought I would share in case anyone out there has a nice system and wants to hear some live vocals without any backing tracks or crowd sounds.",5,27

435,2012-12-23,2012,12,23,8,15awf7,For people confused with Dancing Queen and Mercy,DJLTheFirst,1356220642,"Okay there still seems to be a lot of people confused with why SM would release Dancing Queen that's so similar to Duffy's Mercy. In the beginning of Dancing Queen's MV, it can be seen that time rolls back to 2008, symbolising the fact that Dancing Queen was originally filmed in 2008 and it was indeed filmed and was originally going to be released as a remake of Duffy's Mercy. However there were legal agreement issues with this remake and thus Dancing Queen needed to be put aside. Instead Gee came out and it was a mega hit for SNSD (yay). Going back to the topic. Why did SM release a song that was discarded in 2008 now? Well all the legal agreements were sorted and SM released Dancing Queen prior to release of the REAL ALBUM as a warm up. Now let's stop being confused, tell people who think Dancing Queen is a plagiarized song the truth and wait for the Girl's comeback!

tl;dr - Dancing Queen is a legalised remake, not plagiarism

Any further questions will be answered.

The one that I think would be pretty funny is the carrot/cookie/food kissing game where the team that bites off the smallest piece wins.  If you're with a more promiscuous crowd, just make it a rule that you lose if you actually kiss.  (Then it's fun if you win or if you lose! :D )

Anyone got any more that would be easy to explain quickly to a group of friends and still fun to play?  Lots of the word games would require quite a bit of prep so I don't think they'd turn out as fun, unless you made a set of cards or something ahead of time.

Mods: If this isn't focused enough on SNSD, feel free to remove.  I just came across the idea after watching a bunch of the variety shows of SNSD from the sidebar.",8,17

I have seen several websites such as YesAsia, DVDheaven, Kpoptown and Kpopmart but I want to use the one that has the best price and is the most reliable. So which one do you guys prefer? 

To me YesAsia seems to be the most reliable as it is a big company but also the most expensive. Kpopmart is the cheapest (free poster!) but seems too good to be true (unreliable). The other two seem okay, nothing special.

**tl;dr: Which online store do you prefer ordering your Soshi merchandise from?**

My collection has been growing ever since but finally today the special edition Girls and Peace album finally arrived. Upon opening it, I couldn't be more pleased and I have put together a little [album](http://imgur.com/a/CETmY#0) of what the box contains.

I'M SO HAPPY!

As I'm from the UK customs can be a huge issue, but I ordered through YesAsia and although it was a little bit pricey, I didn't see any customs charges at all!

I'm thinking of using them again to order I Got A Boy, but sadly this means I will not be able to specifically order the Sunny version :(",10,19
