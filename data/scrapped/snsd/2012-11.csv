Bracket is available [here](http://challonge.com/thebestsnsdsong)

This is a double elimination tournament so in this round the losing song is not eliminated from the tournament but goes into the lower bracket for round 2 (losing in lower bracket leads to elimination).

I will be submitting a new thread for voting on 8 matchups at noon GMT over the next 4 days with voting on each thread open for 2 days closing at noon GMT. This may change after round 1 depending on how many additional votes the 2nd day brings.

The first set of matchups are as follows:

I know this because I first saw The Boys MV by clicking on a link over at Fark, and I bookmarked the thread.  [Here](http://www.fark.com/comments/6701619/Eight-random-Americans-asked-what-they-think-about-Korean-girl-group-Girls-Generation-whose-first-US-album-dropped-this-week-30-year-old-guy-Midriffs-are-always-appreciated) it is if anyone is interested.  The CNN story it links to has been edited to include a reference to the Letterman appearance (which I attended, as some of you may know), and it no longer has the link to the MV, but the rest of the article is the same.  

Since that day, I rarely listen to anything other than the Girls (and other Kpop), and that includes my entire 2 hour daily commute to and from work.  I never imagined I could become so obsessed with a girl pop group from halfway around the world, and I certainly never expected the obsession to last this long.  But it has, and this sub has had no small part in keeping the fire burning.  

To mark this occasion, I wanted to thank the people that make this sub what it is.  I have learned much from this place, and have seen and heard so many wonderful things I probably never would have had I not started coming here at the beginning of the year.  This sub (along with /r/Kpop) is so different from the rest of the internet.  There is little drama here, people all seem to get along really well, and trolling is extremely rare.  We share a common bond here and even though we are all different races and colors and ages and come from all over the world, our love for these nine girls makes those differences seem quite irrelevant.  Civil discourse (even between people that have strong, opposing opinions) is the norm here rather than the exception.  The rest of the internet would be much better if it was more like it is here.   

So again, my sincerest thanks to all-contributors, posters, commenters, mods, everyone.  You have helped to make my life just a little bit better and happier over the last year, and in this often stressful and difficult and sometimes even downright miserable life that's a pretty big deal.

This is a double elimination tournament so from this round onwards there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

This is a double elimination tournament so from this round onwards there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

The third set of matchups for round 2 are as follows:

**Upper Bracket**

* [Oh! [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_qXkedUgw) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4mbzHCNY1o) vs [Baby Baby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXa2nTV0DLs)

* [Kissing You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INCiLjb_3cg) vs [Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX3Kq159Kro)

**Lower Bracket - losing equals elimination**

A note regarding the results from round 1. If seeding was accurate we could expect the top 32 songs (who each faced a song from the bottom 32) to advance in the upper bracket. This has been mostly the case with only 7 exceptions the biggest of these being Trick (13) losing out to All My Love Is For You (52). This particular matchup I class as a error in seeding which is due to All My Love Is For You being released after the thread that the seeding info was taken from. As part of a single release I should have probably bumped this and Flower Power up the seeding however I was not happy to make a judgement call on how popular these tracks were particularly with Flower Power being so new. Hopefully with the results from this tournament we can reduce the likelihood of such events in any future tournaments.

What classifies an album to be the Japanese version or the Korean version or the Taiwanese one, etc.? Is it where it is manufactured and/or where it is sold or what?

2. Are materials of the packaging of different versions different? 
3. Do they come with different stuff? 
4. Is one better quality than the other or is one rarer than the other? (e.g. A Korean version of Oh! is better quality than the Japanese version of Oh! and the Japanese version of the First Japanese Album is better quality than the Korean one) Is there a point in getting the different versions besides collecting them?  

5. I read some stuff on the internet and some other websites and i read there are the Oh! photocards with white border and no border. I read the white borders are rarer. Do all Oh! albums come with the no border and the white border ones or did the Limited Edition one only came with the white border ones? 

6. Is there a website somewhere where I can see all of the different photocards? I would ask people to list all the different versions if that wasn't too much trouble here but i feel like it is too much work for a person to type all the different versions so if there is a website, plz post it. If you list all the versions here, thanks a lot. 

7. Do all of the albums with photocards have 2 or more versions of the same member or the same photocard? Once again, if there is a website that shows this, then just tell me the url.

8. Just like the albums, do photocards from the Japanese version or Taiwanese version differ from the Korean photocards at all in terms of quality, place of manufacturing, material, etc.? If so, is one necessarily better to have than the other? (e.g. The photocard received in the Korean Hoot album is better quality than the Taiwanese/Malaysian version)

9. I also saw a video on youtube that the Hoot Taiwanese/Malayasian one had all 18 photocards. Is this legit? Are these real photocards? Do other versions of other SNSD albums include all the cards as well o.O?

 * https://www.facebook.com/musicaonlinestore/posts/148993141838830 (store saying it is Malaysian Hoot album comes wiht all 18)
 * https://www.facebook.com/musicaonlinestore/posts/148993141838830 (uploader replied to top comment to the person who got 18 photocards in their album that their album might be the Taiwanese version) 


And finally to those that have collected all of the photocards in all the albums and collected special photocards (e.g. the Star Cards. I dont know much except they are really rare) and even more, how do you do it? Where do you find all of these photocards and merchandise? How much have you spent in time and money to amass your collection? I feel stressed just asking all of these questions.

Sorry if I have a lot of questions, but I trust the info on this thread a lot more than any info I might find from youtube or Yahoo answers or such. Thanks a lot to the person/people who answer my question.

This is a double elimination tournament so from this round onwards there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket.

This is round 2.5 which only includes lower bracket matches, losers to be eliminated. Here is where the voting gets really tough as each song has won once so there are no easy matchups. The first set of matches are:

Looks like the seeding for the top seeds is accurate so far as in the upper bracket the top 16 are all through to round 3 with the sole exception of Trick (13) which has fallen into the lower bracket and is replaced in the upper bracket by Twinkle (20).

Things look a bit different at the bottom of the competition as instead of seeds 49-64 being eliminated in round 2 the following songs have been eliminated.

* It's Fantastic (26)
* I'm In Love With The Hero (30)
* Fun &amp; Fun (Sweet Talking Baby) (34)

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving into the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 3 has matches from both upper and lower brackets and the first set of matches are:

Some notes on the distribution of songs still left in the competition at the start of Round 3 (32 out of the 64 songs that entered). 

* 18 of the 32 have an official MV
* 25 are primarily Korean, 7 are primarily Japanese
* 7 have multiple language versions
* Every album/EP is represented. A little surprisingly, for me at least, the first Korean album has the most representation with 6 songs, Korean albums 2 and 3 and Japan 1 all having 5 songs each and Japan 2 having 2 of its own. Of the mini albums Gee is most represented with 3 followed by Hoot and Twinkle with 2 and Genie with 1. (Where songs appear on multiple albums or in different languages I have only counted the album/EP it was first released on)
* The only song in the top 32 not on an album/EP is Chocolate Love
* 7 songs punched above their weight based on seeding and consequently 7 that theoretically should have made it this far did not.

The song with the highest number of votes will take 49th place, next highest will take 50th place and so on down to 64th place. Multiple votes for the same song will not be counted ~~and any ballots which do not include a vote for Oppa Nappa will not be counted either~~. Please vote below for 7 songs from the above 16.

I've made a [*picture compilation thread*](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/11cxgv/sky2934s_snsd_pictures_minicompilation_16637/) about a month ago however due to new Mediafire download restrictions, many links were shut down. I've searched for new uploading sites and I've decided to upload them on Google Drive and Adrive (Thanks to [*danscottbrown*](http://www.reddit.com/user/danscottbrown), [*Alkalene*](http://www.reddit.com/user/Alkalene), and [*anguirus*](http://www.reddit.com/user/anguirus) for reuploading some of the files onto RapidShare and MediaFire.). Hopefully these will work out much better.

- 11 WinRAR files, 17974 Pictures, 7.08 Gigs of data

- The compilations are as recent as November 17, 2012.

- My Sunny, HyoYeon, and SooYoung compilation is small enough for me to combine my entire folder as well as my favorites into this upload.

- I've also included a compilation of Krystal (Jessica's sister/label-mate and member of f(x)) pictures as a bonus.

Full playlist of the above songs is [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te1bjjE9kpA&amp;list=PLU3UrE3KRCoympTlxdExs4RPVT-73K04f)

Todays voting will be slightly different as there are no matchups between the songs. Instead each voter can place a vote on 7 songs from the above list (1 of these can be indicated as favourite). The song with the highest number of votes will take 33rd place, next highest will take 34th place and so on down to 48th place. Multiple votes for the same song will not be counted and number of times favourited will be used to determine ties. 

In addition we have two tiebreakers from the previous bonus round. 
 
* [I'm In Love With The Hero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErBPm3rPCL4), [You-aholic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3tNzjk5jjc) and [Ooh La-La!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReQ1wb8UAJk) for 52nd/53rd and 54th place - Please vote for your two favourites in order of preference.
* [It's Fantastic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT9ZU-6TPk) vs [Lazy Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ6--cLuddM) for 59th/60th place - vote for your favourite.

Please vote below for 7 songs from the above 16 clearly marking your favourite (if favourite is not clearly marked I will assume the first song listed is favourite) and make separate votes in the 2 tiebreakers with rules indicated above. Voting in this round will close noon GMT on 20th November.",58,19,False,self,,,,,

So I only recently came across SNSD (I heard 'Gee' while playing TF2) and kinda fell in love. What can I say, Hyoyeon's dancing blows me away!

I really want to buy physical copies of their albums but Amazon UK is rather lame in this regard. Do any of you guys have some advice for how I can order their music from the UK?

I notice that they have 'Girls &amp; Peace' coming out in a few weeks in Japan with a special edition! Is there any way I could be able to get a copy without having to fly over to Japan!

Thanks in advance...

As a personal story, I once remarked that I liked SNSD, and they remarked ""You only like them because they are pretty, same reason everyone else does"". I don't think this would make her an 'anti', though. 

I know there is a difference between not liking a band, and then those who actively hate on them. FYI, 'antis' or 'STAND' (Stand Together Til All Nine Disappear) are those in the latter cateories. 

So I would be interested to hear if anybody here has met or actually knows antis or STAND peoples. Are they K-pop fans who see SNSD as 'beneath' them? Or are they jealous of SNSD's closeness with other K-pop bands?

I think most criticism would be aimed at SNSD being 'too manufactured'? What would you have to say to that? ",17,15,False,self,,,,,

The voting in the bonus round (33-48) is now closed.

Voting on the matchups from round 3.5 is now over. The winners are as follows:

* All My Love Is For You defeats Complete by 28-27
* Girls Generation defeats Forever by 34-21
* Let It Rain defeats The Great Escape by 32-22
* Time Machine defeats Chocolate Love by 36-18
* Trick defeats Star Star Star by 35-20

Full bracket is available [here](http://challonge.com/thebestsnsdsong)

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving on to the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 4 has matches from both the upper and lower bracket and the matches are:

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving on to the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 4.5 only has matches from the lower bracket and the matches are:

* [Paparazzi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfKrnJFKJRA) vs [Girls Generation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVb_huUjMqo)

The song with the highest total number of votes (1st, 2nd and 3rd) will take 17th place, next highest will take 18th place and so on down to 24th place. Multiple votes for the same song will not be counted and any ties caused by multiple songs having same total number of votes will be broken firstly by number of 1st and 2nd place votes combined and if still tied by number of 1st places alone.

This whole being-a-fan thing was new to me at the time and by far it has been the biggest thing to happen to my boring self. Also, I'm a 17 year old male. To begin the story, I'll start from the moment I left the house for my Korean class.

Somewhat typical of Singaporean weather at the end of the year, the skies were pretty much ready to take a dump all over the place. I figured it'd be a really good time to quickly leave the house, but it was too late and my jeans were soaked on the way to the station. It wouldn't be the only time today with wet jeans.

Blah blah had my Korean classes as usual (it's not too hard of a language, you guys totally should try learning it) and decided I'd meet up afterward with my mom for some food and general out-with-family-member stuff.

Before I left for the class though, I saw [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8XiPbnCcAABJHi.jpg) where basically it turned out that I was actually terribly near the girls. My mom had agreed to meet at [City Hall](https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=1.288897,103.85788&amp;spn=0.013022,0.021093&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ei=M6WvUPGXONGUiAeCj4DABA&amp;pw=2), with the oddly rectangular thing on the river east of the Queen Elizabeth Walk being the Floating Platform where the concert was held. So I was *really* close.

The entire time I was with my mom, I the fact that I was so close, yet so far, gnawed away at me. The events that were held at Floating Platform, for example, the National Day Parade, even the Formula 1 race, were terribly easy to watch from the surrounding area. It was then my mom asked if I wanted to just go and attempt to watch the thing; having spent a terribly large amount of time walking about the Marina Bay area (since I live really close by) I went straight towards the Esplanade, hoping that the organizers didn't block up the entire place.

""...    Sorry     ""

I strained my ears as I ran toward the venue, and picked up the ending of Mr Taxi. I found a crowd and figured that was the furthest I could go. Thankfully, the crowd were fairly short (maybe I'm just tall at 180cm) so I could see one of the screens, albeit at an angle.

I'm not really gonna describe the performances, I couldn't see the performers from the location due to the black netting they put up, but the location's sound system was definitely there for me to appreciate.

Here's the videos I managed to catch (turned out that my S3 actually could record 1080p)

[Gee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgqKn2OCZMw)

[Kissing You Remix?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7yZl843mJs)

[The SMTOWN ending song thing (turns out it's called Hope) Warning: Crazy amount of wind/noise due to the weather](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FL7Xi9o4kY)

During that time, there were performances by DBSK, Suju, Shinee, f(x) and BoA (of course). Of the songs they performed, these were what I recognized, not in any real order short of just my memory. Catch Me, Humanoid, Electric Shock, Gee, Mr Taxi, Kissing You, The Boys, Sherlock, Only One(?), and the fateful song, Sexy Free and Single where suddenly the skies decided to take a dump *again*.

This point on there's nothing much related to SNSD or the performances, just random recounts of what I did..

As the rain started to shit all over the non-poncho-wielding no-ticket crowd, some poor fools thought it'd be a great idea not to have brought a umbrella along. I wasn't one of them.

This one dude camped under my umbrella, which I was holding pretty high so I wouldn't block people (not that it would've mattered considering how tall I am.. relatively speaking) while I casually tip-toed to look above the umbrellas of the others in front of me. Eventually everyone's umbrellas slowly rose for no goddamn reason and I couldn't see anything again, after which I had a tactical repositioning, allowing me a decent view again.

At this point the dude decided that the old spot was really good or something and tried to bend down a little and watch past the shoulders of the people in front, meanwhile being soaked. So I tapped the dude's shoulders and invited him to.. well, not get soaked. Then an  uneventful amount of performance watching happened before he decided to run off.

At this point the rain had been fairly tame; heavy enough to warrant umbrellas, light enough to still stick around.

As if the arse of the sky had finally been unclogged, a huuuge downpour proceeded to occur and as had happened just 5 hours before that, my jeans were wet again. (turns out my shoes were fairly waterproof, too)

This girl, with her father (who I mistook as her grandfather), with matching plastic bag hats, decided the rain was a wee bit too much and camped out under my umbrella, while I happily continued watching/listening to Suju.

After a while I noticed they clearly weren't too interested in sticking around and I offered to bring the both of them to whatever shelter they wanted and long story short I escorted the girl (whom I guess was 13? I can't judge ages for nuts) and her father over to a nearby bus stop.

By this point there was waaay too much water and tl;dr wet socks. Nasty.

...and I've run out of stuff I wanted to say. Either way, if you're ever given an opportunity to watch the girls live, free or not, do it. It's one hell of an experience that really can't be described, but definitely recommended.",4,19,False,self,,,,,

Todays voting will be slightly different as there are no matchups between the songs. Instead each voter can vote for 2 songs from the above list and this time order is important. The song with the highest total number of votes (1st and 2nd combined) will take 13th place, next highest will take 14th place and so on down to 16th place. Multiple votes for the same song will not be counted and any ties caused by multiple songs having same total number of votes will be broken by number of 1st places alone and if still tied a separate tiebreaker match will be run.

The voting in the bonus round (13-16) will remain open until Noon GMT on 26th November so if you haven't voted yet [go here to vote.](http://redd.it/13pmvm)

Voting on the matchups from round 5 is now over. The winners are as follows:

**UPPER BRACKET**  

* Genie defeats Run Devil Run by 54-15
* Into The New World defeats Gee by 37-32

**LOWER BRACKET**  

* Oh! defeats Girls Generation by 42-27
* Way To Go defeats Hoot by 36-33

Full bracket is available [here](http://challonge.com/thebestsnsdsong)

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving on to the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 5.5 just has matches from the lower bracket and the matches are:

**LOWER BRACKET - loser is eliminated**

*  [Gee [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b41iRaS-CtE) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6uGCFl2BrM) vs [Oh! [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_qXkedUgw) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4mbzHCNY1o)

Although it is highly desirable that you vote in every matchup if you find that you cannot decide which to vote for and want to abstain from a matchup please clearly indicate this in your post. Where multiple versions exist you do not have to make a distinction between the versions as all count as a vote for the relevant song.

* All My Love Is For You takes 14th place with 30 total votes
* Trick takes 15th place with 26.5 total votes (1 split 2nd place vote)
* Let It Rain takes 16th place with 18 total votes

As Round 5.5 is still ongoing [(go here to vote if you havent already)](http://redd.it/13rbct) we will again look back to songs that were eliminated from the competition in order to rank them. 4 songs were eliminated in round 4.5 and they are:

* [Paparazzi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfKrnJFKJRA)
* [Time Machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoJTjOZco94)

Todays voting will be slightly different as there are no matchups between the songs. Instead each voter can vote for 2 songs from the above list and this time order is important. The song with the highest total number of votes (1st and 2nd combined) will take 9th place, next highest will take 10th place and so on down to 12th place. Multiple votes for the same song will not be counted and any ties caused by multiple songs having same total number of votes will be broken by number of 1st places alone and if still tied a separate tiebreaker match will be run.

Please vote below for 2 songs from the above 4 in order. 

Note: This vote will determine the highest placed primarily Japanese song in this contest, all the top 8 songs are primarily Korean albeit with  5 of the songs having dual language releases.

This is the second bulk order that I have done on reddit and thanks to you guys we have reached a successful full order of 10 sets which gave us the cheapest EMS shipping to the US.  The calenders came faster than expected as it came after a few days of shipping (Usually it would take 2-3 weeks to ship goods to and from South Korea). **I have sent an E-Mail to those who has participated in this bulk order and please reply back so I can send you the DVDs.** 

*Thanks again redditors!*

The voting in the bonus round (9-12) will remain open until Noon GMT on 28th November so if you haven't voted yet [go here to vote.](http://redd.it/13t5hv)

Voting on the matchups from round 5.5 in the lower bracket is now over. The winners are as follows:

* Gee defeats Oh! by 49-13
* Run Devil Run defeats Way To Go by 37-25

Full bracket is available [here](http://challonge.com/thebestsnsdsong)

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving on to the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 6 has matches from the upper bracket and the lower bracket and the matches are:

**UPPER BRACKET FINAL - winner gets automatic slot in Grand Final, loser moves onto Consolidation Final** 

* [Genie [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGP1cUk7cRs) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIULcB9zAps) vs [Into The New World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ24QiODWS0)

**LOWER BRACKET FINAL - loser is eliminated in 4th place, winner moves onto Consolidation Final**

*  [Gee [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b41iRaS-CtE) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6uGCFl2BrM) vs [Run Devil Run [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtuFxg3vQU) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJReD9chwFk)

Although it is highly desirable that you vote in every matchup if you find that you cannot decide which to vote for and want to abstain from a matchup please clearly indicate this in your post. Where multiple versions exist you do not have to make a distinction between the versions as all count as a vote for the relevant song.

The voting in the bonus round (7th/8th playoff) will remain open until Noon GMT on 30th November so if you haven't voted yet [go here to vote.](http://redd.it/13xj3w)

Voting on the matchups from round 6 is now over. The winners are as follows:

**UPPER BRACKET FINAL - winner gets automatic slot in Grand Final, loser moves onto Consolidation Final** 

* Genie defeats Into The New World by 43-40

**LOWER BRACKET FINAL - loser is eliminated in 4th place, winner moves onto Consolidation Final**

* Gee defeats Run Devil Run by 65-18

Full bracket is available [here](http://challonge.com/thebestsnsdsong)

This is a double elimination tournament so there is both an upper bracket and a lower bracket. In each post I will identify which of the matchups are from which bracket. Winning a matchup means moving on to the next round in the same bracket. Losing in the upper bracket results in dropping into the lower bracket and losing in the lower bracket leads to elimination from the tournament.

Round 6.5 is the consolidation final and is a rematch of an upper bracket matchup from Round 5 in which Into The New World triumphed over Gee 37-32. This time around the winner progresses into the Grand Final and the loser is eliminated in 3rd place:

[Into The New World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ24QiODWS0) vs [Gee [KOR]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b41iRaS-CtE) or [[JPN]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6uGCFl2BrM)
