Now I want to learn some of their song's lyrics but I don't speak Korean so I only look for romanization lyrics. However I have a little bit of a problem when trying to sing along with some lyrics videos...

Why do Koreans use 'eo' 'ae' and doube letters like 'jj' 'jy' etc.. and other confusing character combinations in the lyrics? And then add them all in one really long word...?

Example in SNSD Gee Lyrics: 

'Neomuneomu meotjyeo nuni nuni busyeo' - this is hard to read.

Why do they not use simple spelling like how they spell Japanese romanizations? If it were spelled like in Japanese romanization, it will look like this:

'Nomu nomu motjo nuni nuni busho' - see how this is easier to read?

From what I understand, the romanization lyrics are for non-Korean speakers so they can sing along without the need for the word's meanings. So why are the words' spellings so complicated?",10,1,False,default,,,,,

His birthday is on the last week of September. So far the only vague ideas I have are to learn one of their dances, or to learn more lyrics... but I'm not even sure what his favorite song is, or what the most favorited dance by them is. I even thought of trying to dress up like them, but again, I don't know what he would like best.

Some info:
1. I'm Asian. 
2. I heard that his favorite is Yoori? Yuri?

Please help. And sorry for my english. Thanks!

**Edit: Thanks so much for all your advice! I think I'll give him the iconic Yuri sweaters and the albums he doesn't have yet :) user limenuke made me realize that my boyfriend might not really like seeing me dressing up like snsd, although the military uniform 3d6 mentioned sounds doable.

Do you think they could do headlining solo shows? I'm not sure they could do entire arenas or stadiums or anything like that like they do over in Asia, but I'm sure they could pull a good crowd to maybe an arena with the top half closed off or maybe some outdoor amphitheaters. I'm pretty sure that's what 2NE1 did last month.

It'd also help if they repackaged some of their albums like they've done for Japan, but do it for America. I'd kill for even a legit ""best of"" compilation album/double album from them.

I don't blame the guy though, Lots of money to be made. However one of my concerns is the possibility of losing the ""Queens of K-Pop"" title in Korea. Similar to the Wonder Girls and the US. With new and fantastic girl groups coming out such as AOA and Hello Venus, on top of the pre-exsiting girl groups like f(x), Miss A etc... It's just a matter of time right?

Will SM be able to pull this off and keep the girls popularity in Korea and earn more popularity in Japan? I've also heard rumors of a Korean comeback very soon and regular international promotion will be very difficult for the girls and the company. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Especially from an international point of view. I wonder how this will all play out.

When it occurred to me that debut era Girl's Generation had insanely demanding/intensive dances comparative to Gee era on. 

Into the New World is another example of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLWhM9vZTic&amp;feature=related

and Girl's Generation is another case of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lCxS2z5ylY

and then you have new dances which are maybe more refined and less-demanding dances such as Genie, which in my opinion is their most intensive dance post-gee era: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMSY-UcQgQY


Basically the point I'm trying to make is: Do you like Debut-Era dances more or the newer dances. 

I personally prefer the older dances as it shows the energy the girl's had and the determination it took to get there, but I do understand that they still work just as hard as they did then, but I think their Choreographer might be not showing the same dedication.

247,SNSD,t5_2s1g4,2012-9-18,2012,9,18,3,1018fo,self.SNSD,[Guide] SNSD 101: How to Stay Up-to-Date with SNSD Information (x-post from /r/Kpop),https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1018fo/guide_snsd_101_how_to_stay_uptodate_with_snsd/,soshix21,1347906183,"Hi /r/snsd, this is a simplified cross-post from /r/kpop. I tailored it towards SNSD. Its a bit long, so I apologize ahead of time. 

Ive gotten a few questions over the last few months about how exactly I stay on top of Soshi news and information. Heres my list of recommendations, in order of most important to least (the first 3 are the best):

* **Twitter**: There really isnt a single website that is more influential and important to the spread of information than Twitter. Sources directly tweet and respond to thousands of people simultaneously. From here, you often hear the fastest news, most recent pictures, and leaks/spoilers to upcoming events/music. The difficult thing about twitter is that there is no centralized representative, so there are major Big Name Fans in each fandom. A few good ones off the top of my head are:

&gt;For SNSD: 
&gt;
&gt;* @Real_Chichinhu
&gt;* @ch0sshi
&gt;* @haljung
&gt;* @MoonSoshi9 (I think hes also a Redditor. Yup: /u/MoonSoshi9)

Beyond that, there are twitter accounts associated with almost all major fansites (@sosiznet), fanmade photo sites (@flying_petals), and actual artists (none for SNSD ). You can add whoever you want depending on your preferences.

* **Hallyu8/Forums**: Sometimes Twitter is overwhelming. Some fans tweet all day, so news can be lost amidst personal and random information. Forums have always been a great place for fans to come together. Its nice because its a more distilled form of information that doesnt disappear if you dont read it within a certain amount of hours. You can backtrack on your favorite artists after a long day of work or after being away for weeks. Moreover, hundredsif not thousandsof fans try their best to quickly post new information to notify others. Thus, it helps bring together people of different fandoms and bias groups to post the pictures and news they find. Lastly, it helps fans communicate with each otherboth Koreans and Non-Koreans. This is helpful because people vent their frustrations, express their happiness, and are able to read translations/subs of news articles/videos before theyre even released on Allkpop or other congregates (usually hours to days before).

After 6Theory, the major forum site last year associated with Allkpop, disappeared, the best forum site now is probably [Hallyu8.com](http://hallyu8.com/). Just recently, Hallyu8 just began their New Members Appreciation Week, encouraging the community to reach out and invite new people, so Ive seen a huge spike in new users making it an opportune time for others from here to join if they wanted to. I would check out [this page](http://hallyu8.com/topic/147-artist-thread-directory/) with all the links to artists/idols threads. For SNSD, [this is their thread link]( http://hallyu8.com/topic/30-the-official-girls-generation-%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EC%8B%9C%EB%8C%80-snsd-thread/). I guarantee that if you are a major fan of SNSD, youll love the thread for the sheer amount of camaraderie and similar enthusiasm. 

Lastly, a *personal* plug, were trying to keep track of newcomers and help acclimate them to the community, so if you could: 1) **Post a reply with your username and mine** (Referred by: sx21) on [this page,](http://hallyu8.com/topic/19555-referral-form/) 2) Post a 411 so the community can properly welcome you[ here](http://hallyu8.com/forum/4-members-411/), and 3) Say Hi in the SNSD thread. Fellow fans and members will welcome you with open arms. If you jump in and start posting, youll see why forums are a great community.

* **Tumblr**: Tumblr is great for sharing new pictures, gifs, and fanmade edits. It hurts itself because there arent really that many that discuss Kpop. People like OnionTaker used it as a platform to start a community, but these types of situations are rare. For SNSD, there are some great ones like ggoh.tumblr.com who makes new content and answers questions. Furthermore, tumblr is great because it has a search tag function. If you replace the #### with a group name or idol you like, you can find all the recent posts tagged with it: www.tumblr.com/tagged/#### This is how I find the most recent gifs for people on Reddit when they ask during a comeback. Put SNSD in there, and see all the most recent gifs made by the community. Put Taeyeon, and youll only find content related to her. Also, this helps find tumblrs associated with your interested by seeing who submitted those posts.

* **News Aggregates**: There are good news aggregates and bad ones, depending on how they present the news and how nonbias they are. My favorite to visit is probably Koreaboo (by our very own /u/fiveSeven_). Koreaboo (like Soompi, AllKpop, etc) is a news aggregate with information from all areas of Korean Media (not only music). KB is very professional with their wording and timings, without losing their quality. The biggest issues with these sites are that they arent always up-to-date with information, sometimes even days to weeks behind when news is actually released, and cant possibly cover all the information about all your favorite artists. They need to (understandably) choose what is appropriate and post the most important. 

* **Special Sites**: First, [Omona](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/) is a more unfiltered approach to Kpop news. They are a bit quicker and they dont take themselves as seriously as the sites above. Second, [NetizenBuzz](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/) is run to provide recent reactions from Korean Netizens by directly translating articles and comments. Not all the comments are worthwhile/rational, but they give a good glimpse into how Korea is reacting, instead of only reading international opinions on Reddit or Allkpop. Third, Reddit. We have our own /r/Kpop, which provides barebones news, past throwbacks to MVs/music, and have some discussion. It is generally the most mature Kpop environment Ive found on the web, simply because it emulates the rest of Reddit/the type of members it attracts. However, because its user-driven it might be the sparsest for actual up-to-date information. Also, check out related reddits like /r/Korea and /r/koreanmusic. Lastly, [SeoulBeats](http://seoulbeats.com/) is a great site to read editorials and more lengthy discussions. While the quality has gone done over the years, it nevertheless is the best site for actual written content. I may not agree with everything posted, but they are valid opinions of someone else.

* **Korean Sites**: There are numerous Korean sites that help keep people informed. The obvious Newsen, OSEN, Navar, Daum, etc are good for those who can read and understand Korean, but not everyone can. Moreover, it is hard to translate all those articles and reactions no matter how hard we try. Other sites, like fanmade sites for photos (ShiningSmiles, Seople), often require a KSSN to gain access, but you try to e-mail/tweet them for permission. I can discuss this in another guide in the future.

* **Chatrooms**: Most major communities have a chatroom, but they are often hard to find. Some, for example, are: /r/snsd, Hallyu8s ustream room via their Artist Thread, SSFs Sbox. 

* **Soshified**: The biggest international SNSD site that has slowed down from the mayhem of a few years ago. It still has a stable forum/gifting portion, and an assortment of past SNSD media/subs. The staff members are active and still writing/working. I expect a comeback to rejuvenate this site. 


I purposely left out how to access K-Media (Video, Pictures, Subs, Torrents, etc) and fansites because I felt that this guide was already too long. Ill try to write another one up in the future if this first guide is well received or people request it. If not, I can just leave this here for any newcomers, and keep it at that. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns via comments or PM.

About a week after that thread was created, someone made /r/snsdyoona and I even saw a thread about how /r/yoona was taken.

Now I am not sure what to do with it. As /r/SNSD grows I think separate subreddits makes sense. So yeah just wondering if anyone wants it, or if I should just never ever use it. Or if I should be direct competition against /r/snsdyoona.

I don't think we've done this before, but I think it might be fun to have everyone dump all their Hyoyeon photos into one thread instead of all over the subreddit. I am kind of conflicted though, because I still like seeing all the Hyoyeon photos on the frontpage too, so maybe post them here if you want, and if you particularly like it, post it as a separate post as well? It doesn't really matter!

Anyway, I can't contribute because I only have access to my iPad. But If anyone has any pictures they'd like to share, go for it!

My conversations with girls (Let alone Tiffany) are reduced to stammering and awkward pauses, so this mixtape is meant to put how I feel a tad more elegantly. Although Tiffany most probably won't hear this tape, it's just fun to play with the idea and put the songs out there.

I put a lot of effort into this tape so it would mean the world if you gave it a listen, or even a download!

For some reason, Jessica backgrounds were the hardest thing in the world to find, which is why most of them are 1020x840 px instead of the quality that the other ones have. I did have to search for Sooyoung/Yuri/Seohyun/Jessica backgrounds because my folder is very Yoona heavy. &gt;_&lt;

I've been very curious as to what the demographics of SNSD fans so I figured I'd be able to get a good response with a survey.

I created this pretty short survey:

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2MZC5SL

If you have a few minutes I'd love to get responses. I'll let this sit for a few days to a week to get as many responses as possible. I'll then make a new submission with the results so no one misses it. *No need to keep this post bookmarked.*

**Please upvote for visibility.** *This is a self-post so I will receive no karma.*

I hoped to have the survey last all weekend but when checking to see how many responses I had gotten surveymonkey would only let me see the first 100 unless I paid up. If a moderator or someone wants to conduct another by all means feel free. Other people pointed out that some surveys had been done in the past. 

*If you just got here and have no idea what I'm talking about: I posted a survey earlier today because I was curious about the demographics of this subreddit. Little did I know surveymonkey only lets you see the first 100 submissions unless you pay for an account. The whole plan was a bust. I was hoping to get 500+ replies but had to cut it short. I deleted the self-post that contained the survey link and created this because people expressed interest in the results.*

I didn't want all the information to go to waste so here are the first 100 responses.

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. If there are ties, multiple pictures will be chosen.
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be SNSD related, either a group picture or something that relates to them. **No single member pictures allowed.** Couple pictures are fine, but I would like to keep it as OT9, mainly because some couples are more popular than others.
* One picture per post, you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.",41,27,False,self,,,,,
