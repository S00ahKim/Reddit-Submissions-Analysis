I'm no expert at this, but if you guys notice anything wrong (like missing links or whatever) PM me and I'll get it fixed :D I'm still messing with things here and there, so if you notice something weird, it's probably me and my 'trial and error' approach to CSS.

Hey guys,

What type of background would you like from SNSD?

Suggest them here and also start a vote.

I have a couple themes in mind which is obviously their cover song/theme/hit song

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently: **'The Boys'**


Past: **Gee**, **Oh!**, **Run Devil Run**,**Hoot**, **Genie/Tell me your wish**, and **Mr. Taxi**


Old (The girls have grown T-T): **Into the new world!**, **Girls' Generation**(the song), and **Kissing you**


Plain: Pink(SNSD :D), Pink with a black/dark theme


Note: I might be wrong in which I'm sorry so please correct me ^^ thanks!

Very awesome. Just a few weeks ago this subreddit only had 58 subscribers and was pretty much deserted. When a couple of us decided to try and resurrect this place, I didn't think we would grow this much in such a short amount of time. Now we've reached 300+ subscribers and are steadily growing. So let's keep this place growing and let's keep the content flowing :D

As the mods, we'll try and come up with some cool things for this subreddit. Maybe a new spiffy theme in the near future :D",9,20
