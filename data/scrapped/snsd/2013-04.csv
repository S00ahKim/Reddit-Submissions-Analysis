1. Does anyone know where one would find/buy better quality MVs, fps and/or bitrate, that hasn't touched YouTube? 

2. Is my only option here to buy a Blu-ray of the MV (would that be better quality?)

Also For audio I have tried editing in 320 kbps audio tracks onto downloaded MV video tracks just not the same and take forever to rerender. 

TL;DR 24/29 fps YouTube MVs are horrible! Need better. &lt;3

Never one to give up and always one to have such a powerful devotion to her fans, she performed the 3-hour set anyway, trying not to show her pain.

I can't seem to find any other news on this just yet, but I hope that if this is true, that her condition isn't serious.

As a Sunshiner, it kind of makes be feel a bit ashamed of myself for skipping the gym the last few days due to a nasty head cold.  Since New Years Day of this year, I've lost over 40 pounds using SNSD (and Sunny) as my main motivation.  Even though I managed to somehow still lose another 2 pounds this week, I'm still packing my gym bag for tomorrow to do double time.  Like Sunny, I'm not going to stop until I fall.

Get well soon, Sunny.

A couple miscellaneous notes:

We can get these shirts with red, blue, or green sleeves, but the size small is currently sold out in all those colors from our distributor. If you would like those colors in any other size, please message me or include a note in the checkout.

The [Sooyoung ""Fun"" shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/119225403/girls-generation-snsd-sooyoung-fun-t?) from the IGaB video will be discontinued at the end of this month, so if you want one now is the time to get it, as we won't be bringing it back.

All of the member emblem shirts continue to be popular, so we'll continue to offer them. 

Thanks again to all of you. As always, if you have any questions/requests/suggestions, send me a message!",4,30

Here's what I'll do:

If you buy **both** of these items:

[Jessica IGAB Emblem Shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/119196319/girls-generation-snsd-jessica-emblem-t?)

[Jessica ""Air GG"" Raglan Shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/129230911/snsd-girls-generation-jessica-air-gg?)

I will send you your choice of these two shirts FREE:

[SNSD Names Shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/120751696/girls-generation-snsd-group-member-names?)

[SNSD IGAB Emblem Shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/118765240/girls-generation-snsd-i-got-a-boy-2013?)

All you need to do is specify in the checkout which of those two you want for your free shirt, what size, and what color. I'll take care of the rest. There will be no additional cost for shipping the free shirt, either, it's totally on me.

**The deal ends Sunday night at midnight EST.**

I just thought I would get creative to celebrate Sica's birthday :)

If this goes well, I just might run similar member-specific promos in the future. 

Let me know if you have questions. Thanks!",5,49

I'm going to ask you guys why you think SNSD is worth listening to. Why would a non-kpop person get into SNSD? Why do people listen to ex. 2NE1, Shinee, PSY etc... 

People do not understand the lyrics, but they are still extremely into the artists in general, what attracts them? Is it the looks or is it something else?

Basically, why are you interessted in SNSD, why are you listening to them and what made you dvelve deeper into their group?

So after performing Oh, they were all on the center substage and they said that Taeyeon prepared a cake for Jessica!! And then boom, there was the cake and staff with a camera. The cake said 'happy birthday Jessica' and had the album logo on it with candles for 24.

Jessica was surprised and said the cake was pretty. Then they asked what her wish was, and Tiffany said 'I'm genie for your wish'. So Jessica closed her eyes and Hyoyeon swiped a bit of frosting off the cake and ate it. That made Jessica pause a bit but she said finally that her wish was to do another tour, possibly a dome tour! Then Sunny suddenly put her face in front of the camera lol. 

Jessica went on to say that they had a party on her birthday (a pajama party?) but Hyoyeon left early, so Sica teased her saying that Hyoyeon probably doesn't care about her. Hyoyeon went over to Jessica to try to kiss her. XD Jessica said she was just joking and said she loves her. Aw

Tiffany went to the camera holding a bunch of towels and pouted how she prepared them. Then later she accidentally dropped the towels on the cake! I think she blamed the cameraman for bumping into her lol. Sooyoung had to take the towels off and said to please take care of the cake! 

Someone put frosting on Jessica's cheek (Sooyoung or Tiffany's?) and Yuri tried to put a piece of fruit or something blue on Jessica but it didn't stick. 

When they took the cake away they were still talking about Sica and she was like 'moving on...' lol 

kk that's all I remember for now orz.""

Next weekend I will be traveling to Seoul and while I am there, I plan to take a day and go to Taeyeons Shrine at her parents eyeglass store in Jeonju (as far as I can tell it is still open but if you know otherwise, please say something!). Here is a video if you do not know what I am talking about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpW0HRgshno. 

Since I am going all the way down there, I figured I should ask if there is anyone that wants me to take a message for them (apparently people even leave messages/gifts for the other girls as well). They have a guest book (and many other books for that matter) so there are places I can leave messages from people in the subreddit and maybe one day Taeyeon will thumb through them! If there are just a couple messages I can leave them in the guestbook but if there are many more I can dress up our presentation a bit. I cannot take gifts as I am going to China after Korea and my packing space is tight but I plan on taking a little something for her parents or the employees that are there that day.

So why should you entrust your heartfelt message with some random (mostly) lurker? I can ensure you I am an adult (and married) and I will treat your message with respect.

Rules:

1. You can send me a message through reddit and I will put it into Word on its own page and dress it up or you can send a file/email to goodshotredtwo@gmail.com.

1. Nothing inappropriateand please do not send me your 18+ 300 page TaeNy fanfiction.

1. Do not include a name or user name you do not want anyone else to see.

1. No phone numbers or email addresses asking Taeyeon to contact you.

1. If you send a message in Korean I will be checking that it is appropriate.

1. You can send one picture as well and I will do my best to get it printed if there are only a few but if there are dozens then I might not be able to do this.

**tl;dr version:**
[Sooyoung's one-of-a-kind bluetooth earphones](http://i.imgur.com/WvwAdl8.jpg)  possibly for sale soon. Owned but not used by her. Proceeds for semi-good cause. Interested?

**The Item:**
LG *only ever made nine* of these headsets. One for each girl and thus modified for each owner. Those of you who have made the pilgrimage to Taeyeon's family spectacles shop in her hometown will have seen the kid leader's pair in a display cabinet.

It comes complete with LG's [spelling error of Girls' Generation](http://i.imgur.com/4qVMsDD.jpg). I'm not really an audiophile so I'll just post up the photos and [leave it up to the experts to decide the intrinsic value](http://i.imgur.com/5CwsqdK.jpg).

I personally think it's [a piece of history](http://i.imgur.com/8aCBROO.jpg).



**Bit more context:**

Some might already know the K-Culture of actors and idols getting catering service from their fans during filming, performances or concert periods. It's not that the celebrity in question can't afford it, it's more like a show of strength for a fandom to be able to get enough money together to feed an entire filming cast and crew with quality food. Kinda like saying to the cast and crew ""you better treat our girl/boy well"".

Sooyoung is filming a drama. Some of her fans want to do something big. One of the ideas is a fan-auction for a limited edition bluetooth headset (made for each SNSD member) by LG, Sooyoung edition. She never got around to using them and gave them away as a gift. So I guess it's kind of a way of giving the gift back to her and passing on the goodwill.

But anyway, I'm asking in case there are any SONE or Sooyoung fans about who want to own it. Then we can go ahead with the fan auction and feed Sooyoung for a day (if that is even possible lol). I don't think they're expecting the headset to fund all of the catering, but it should contribute a fair bit to the rather large costs involved.

And I'm always frustrated that all of these kinds of events are limited to people in Korea. Like how Yoona's Genie costume (the one she performed their first ever stage performance of Genie) was open only to Koreans and went for some small amount when there were hundreds of international fans begging for a chance. Well, no geographic barriers here! If there's enough people interested, the auction will open soon, so leave a comment below if you are ^ _ ^

**Edit (1):**
Auctions of this type usually means person with the most money wins. Someone has suggested doing it like a lottery system... where one ticket costs $x and there's no limit to number of tickets. So everybody still has a mathematical chance of winning even if they only put down, say $5. And everyone gets to contribute to Sooyoung's drama food support.",25,34

* 1  - I love Sica so that's already total win, and while I'm not at all into Kpop guys I absolute *love* Onew's contribution here. Also, total goosebumps every time I play it - it's so heartbreakingly beautiful. Basically everything a ballad should be.",23,24

We've also so far had $250 in donations outside of the auction itself,which takes the **grand total up to $1500** to support Sooyoung's drama filming cast and crew!

----

Thanks again to the mods for allowing this.

**tl;dr version:**

* [Sooyoung's one-of-a-kind  bluetooth earphones](http://i.imgur.com/WvwAdl8.jpg)
* Made especially for Sooyoung by LG Electronics as a ""Thank You"" gift.
* Now on auction for Sooyoung Drama Food Support.
* Ends **May 6th 23:59 KST**.

**How to take part:**
Send an e-mail to j@oniontaker.com with your reddit username and contact e-mail address. To prove that you are a serious bidder with the actual ability to contribute to the support, there will be a nominal registration fee of  $0.09.

The auction will take place in the reddit thread and moderated closely. Please only bid if you are serious, and do not change bids once they have been posted.

Please do note that while I am helping out this support project, **I am not personally involved** other than in trying to sort out logistics for some Koreans who wanted international fans to be involved but didn't know how to do it.

**Procedure**

1. Send an e-mail to j@oniontaker.com with your reddit username and contact e-mail address. 
1. You will be provided with the e-mail address to confirm your validity via the $0.09 registration fee.
1. Once this has been cleared, you can place a bid on the item.
1. Each bid must be at least 10% higher than the previous bid (or $10, whichever is higher).

Logistics allowing, a parallel auction will take place on soshified.com

1. If this is the case, send an e-mail to j@oniontaker.com with your soshified username and contact e-mail address.
1. You will be provided with the e-mail address to confirm your validity via the $0.09 registration fee.
1. Once this has been cleared, you can place a bid on the item.
1. Each bid must be at least 10% higher than the previous bid (or $10, whichever is higher), and increments will be capped at $50.

Moderators will keep both threads updated if a higher bid is placed in a different thread.

**The Item:**
LG *only ever made nine* of these headsets. One for each girl and thus modified for each owner. Those of you who have made the pilgrimage to Taeyeon's family spectacles shop in her hometown will have seen the kid leader's pair in a display cabinet.

It comes complete with LG's [spelling error of Girls' Generation](http://i.imgur.com/4qVMsDD.jpg). I'm not really an audiophile so I'll just post up the photos and [leave it up to the experts to decide the intrinsic value](http://i.imgur.com/5CwsqdK.jpg).

I personally think it's [a piece of history](http://i.imgur.com/8aCBROO.jpg).

A normal not one-of-a-kind version of this model retails for about $70-$100 depending on where you look.
