#[SNSD 10TH ANNIVERSARY ] 
#All 8...Why Did Only 'Soshi' Survive**

""The road SNSD walked will become history for K-POP girl groups.""

SNSD will be celebrating their 10th anniversary on August 5th, the nation's longest-running, active girl group. SNSD is living up to their name as the nation's top girl group by being listed as the number 1 group in Billboard's top 10 list of 'K-Pop Girl Groups of the Past Decade (Critic's Picks)'.

2nd generation groups that debuted in 2007 divided into three parts with Wonder Girls and KARA alongside SNSD, but only SNSD survived.

SNSD was ambitiously put forth by SM Entertainment, the company who discovered the representative group for first generation idols, H.O.T. The history of idols in Korea goes back over 20 years following H.O.T's debut in 1996, and SNSD occupies half of that.

Professionals agree that SNSD is an unprecedented group, as girl groups do not last a long time, and that is considered matter of fact.

Pop music critic Kim Yoon Ha said, ""SNSD is a rare group in K-POP, where girl groups are considered to having a short lifespan. Contracts between the company and artist lasts for a maximum of 7 years. Maintaining this for 10 years has meaning and is symbolic.""

Editor-in-chief for idol webzine 'Idology' and pop music critic Moon Yong Min also stated, ""There are almost no girl groups that celebrate their 10th anniversary. Being able to carry on the 'girl' title until their late-20s in itself has a deep meaning.""

-----

**-Why did only SNSD survive**

Regarding SNSD, SM confidently said, ""This is the nation's first completed girl group, brought together by all of SM's planning from casting-training-producing-management.

In order to bring each member's singing, dancing, acting, and language all together, members received various training, at the longest, 7 years, and for an average of 5 years. We put our heart and soul into this from the stages of forming the members.""

Professionals also agreed with these things. Critic Kim Yoon Ha said, ""Korea's biggest entertainment company, SM, also plays a part in SNSD's 10th anniversary. The quality control was done well.""

SM's producing also stands out. SNSD's debut single 'Into the New World', released on August 5, 2007, was assessed as having maximized the image the general public has for girl groups in terms of music, performance, and visuals.

Their self-titled official album, 'Girls' Generation', released the same year in November, was also the same. Remaking Lee Seung Chul's big hit from 1989, which also has the same name as their group name, 'Girls' Generation', was brilliant.

Critic Moon Yong Min said, ""The fact that girl group idols who put forth the 'girl [image/title]' reached their 10th anniversary hold a deep meaning. Each and everything that SNSD promotes from now on will become history for K-POP girl groups.""

One thing that's different between 2nd generation girl groups, like SNSD, and 1st generation girl groups, like S.E.S and Fin.K.L, is the former took on the role of Hallyu advancement.

SNSD gained lots of popularity in Japan with their 'alpha girl' image from, not only their visuals and musical capabilities, but also from their confidence and enthusiasm.

Critic Moon Yong Min chose the title song from SNSD's 4th mini album, 'Mr. Mr.', released in February of 2014, as one that had that image compressed into it the most. The narrator is a girl in love, but it's a song that has the active demeanor of leading a guy.

Critic Moon stated, ""If you compare SNSD with girl groups who debuted around the same time, they have a strong image of an ambitious, confident female college student who grew up comfortably. 'Mr. Mr.' seems to praise and flatter the guy, but it's actually about telling the guy to become someone who suits the girl.""

They don't just put forth their visuals and performance, but their music also plays a role. 'I Got A Boy' from their 4th official album, released in January of 2013, had a really complicated structure and was judged as an innovative song at the time.

Pop music critic Lee Dae Hwa stated, ""It's amazing that they've been able to keep their place on top for 10 years with dance music, when those trends change quickly. They weren't the best every time, but the music itself was good and they put out a good concept along with it. There was a girl group craze starting at the end of 2000, that contributed to the flow going on for a long time.""

Of course, there was also a crisis. In 2014 Jessica left the group and they had to reorganize as from 9 members to 8. However, because ""the members had strong desires to uphold the group"" (critic Moon Yong Min), they were able to tie things up well.

In her interview with W magazine, which SNSD decorated the August cover for, Sunny said, ""Everyone had their own slumps like when they went through puberty, and and we experienced group difficulties together. I think the thing that helped at times like that was each other.""

---

**-The 8 members' growth**

SNSD was able to become a long-running girl group because of the group as well as how each of the members have developed. Each were able to take advantage of their own personalities and positive traits, each of the 8 members were able to gain big recognition.

With her superior singing skills, main vocal Taeyeon had her solo album and took part in various drama OSTs, making a place for herself as a strong artist. Sunny has been showing her talents on variety shows with her cheerful charms.

Tiffany, whose eye smiles is one of her charms, is active with her language skills and global music sense. Hyoyeon has her great dance skills and hearty personality. Yuri's innocent and cheerfulness appeals to both men and women.

Sooyoung has good sense and is thought of as a new fashionista. Yoona, who is beautiful to the point of being called the standard of girl group centers, is active as an acting-[i]dol in her drama 'The King Loves'. The youngest, Seohyun, received acknowledgement for her singing and acting through the musicals 'Gone With the Wind' and 'Mamma Mia!'.

SNSD also attempted quite a few things with things like the TTS unit group with their vocals, Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Seohyun, doing music with a different color from SNSD's.

SM said, ""When the members are doing their group and individual activities, their personalities are clear, and SNSD appealed in various areas. That played a role in SNSD being able to go on for a long time.""

SM said they carefully watched over them during their singing, dancing, acting, and language training before they debuted.

""We picked up on what each member was particularly good at during that process. The vocal member focused SNSD-TaeTiSeo unit promoted successfully. When the members released their solo albums, we took each of their vocal styles, performance skills, and visuals into consideration.

For members who had a talent in acting, we let them build up their acting experiences through lessons from their early debut days. We're going to continue showing good appearances of the members individual advantages through musicals, variety shows, and other things.""

Critic Kim Yoon Ha said, ""Each of the members characters are unique and their abilities were expressed well. This was refined individually and as a group the past 10 years.""

# [SNSD 10TH ANNIVERSARY ] 
#The Original 'Samchon Fan'...Best Songs Chosen By Professionals

With their 10th anniversary, one of SNSD's specialties is that they've surpassed pop culture to having a social impact as well.

In particular, last year, SNSD's 'Into the New World' resonated at the site of a protest at Ewha Womans University, spotlighting this, not just in the music industry, but socially as well. This was a moment where it was confirmed that an idol is not just a pop culture icon, but has social influence.

Someone called 'Into the New World' the 'morning dew for the young generation'. In her interview in W magazine's August issue, Yuri said, ""I watched the video numerous times, I got choked up and even cried. I was really proud as a singer.""

SM said, ""Protest songs were sung in past student protests, we felt pop music being sung was the natural flow of generations. We see it as a positive thing. That representative song being SNSD's 'Into the New World' is very meaningful to us, too.""

Critic Kim Yoon Ha stated, ""The reason 'Into the New World' was brought back into light because of a social phenomenon along with the song's good energy creating a synergy with the worth that comes with the group's name that the members have established the past 10 years. It deserves praise as an idol pop song as is, so its meaning can be fully spread through general society.""

SNSD's history is currently progressing. Their 6th official album 'Holiday Night', releasing online on the 4th, will also be in light of their 10th anniversary. They will be having a 10th anniversary fan meeting, 'Girls' Generation 10th Anniversary - Holiday to Remember', on their debut anniversary date on the 5th.

Critic Lee Dae Hwa said, ""SNSD received a broad range of love from people in their teens to samchon (uncle) fans, so that's why they were probably able to go on for a longer time. Succeeding in their overseas advancement in their prime, leading girl groups in Hallyu [advancements], and they gained a status different from other groups.

""I think their lasting power is great because they hit a high peak. They've become a great icon whose image doesn't get damaged because they can't do one thing. I think their long lasting existence also comes from that.""

SM said, ""SNSD was composed by SM's planning abilities and producing. They were able to exceed the nation and grab hold of the title of Asia's No.1 girl group through the fandom's full support and general public's love. 'Girls' Generation' is an icon and artist of a generation.""

**-SNSD's Best Songs Chosen by Professionals**

Critics Kim Yoon Ha-Kim Hak Sun, Reporter Lee Je Hoon  'Into the New World' (2007 debut song)

Kim Yoon Ha: ""Not only is 'Into the New World' SNSD's representative song, but it's Korea's best idol pop debut song. It has the positivitity, dreams, courage, happiness, joy, and other energy that you recall when you think about idols. It doesn't put forth sexuality like other girl group songs, and it's one of few songs that gives a positive, happy energy. I think it will be popular for at least another 10 years.""

Kim Hak Sun: ""'Into the New World' has become an example. Songs from the many different girl groups who appeared after SNSD get compared to 'Into the New World'. Not depending on a hook and the structure slowly building up is worth praising as well. More than anything, it's the melody that isn't too light or heavy. It became a hot topic after being sung at the Ewha Womans University protest, but but it also means that the melody has a strength that everyone can sing together. Even when it's SNSD's 20th anniversary, 'Into the New World' will be their best song.""

Lee Je Hoon: ""SNSD's true value is the feeling soaked in their music and members, and that being met with their performance. The pleasure that comes from 'Into the New World's' particularly emotional melody and hopeful lyrics, and girls' bold kick is incredible.""

Moon Yong Min 'I Got A Boy' (January 2013, official 4th album title song)

""This is a song that had the most of SNSD's power and was like the final result during that time. The stage itself had a shout of concentration in it. Just watching the synchronized choreography is brutal. There were a lot of girl groups trying to push their way up as well as commercial risk, so I want to give them high ratings for showing such an experimental, drastic song despite that. The song has a very dramatic structure, so it's like a musical. The complicated feelings and rushed structure, that even seems nimble, could be the essence of K-POP.""

Lee Dae Hwa 'Gee' (January 2009, first mini album title song)

""This is one of SNSD's best made songs, and it's one that was at the center of hook songs at the time. If you consider the popularity in Korea, I think it's a song that was at the peak of SNSD's career.""",0,20

141,2017-8-9,2017,8,9,16,6sjt65,SNSD in Hogwarts,kbdsct,1502262228,"Blame Holiday Night hype, but I've been thinking so much about these girls, and how far they've come (so proud!). I was wondering what houses they'd be sorted into, had they gone into Hogwarts, and whether they would even be friends if they were witches in different houses because, well, most friendship groups in Hogwarts are of the same house.
I would think : Hufflepuff: Tiffany, Sunny. I find the two of them very hard-working -I know they all are, but Tiffany overcame so many barriers and Sunny had to work hard to make people get over the whole nepotism thing.
Slytherin: Taeyeon, Yuri (This is my house, and the reason I feel they both fit in here is because they're complicated characters, and even misunderstood (like most Slytherins). I find Yuri very underrated, and I also find her very intriguing. But I also noticed that she broods a lot, and doesn't look like someone you can easily approach (unlike Sunny or Tiff, who look like the easiest people to approach and say hi to). Taeyeon is someone I consider a real Slytherin: she's not going to be the sweetest girl to anyone (despite her cute looks) and she would rather get away from the light and stay somewhere out of reach, only coming out to show people what she is good at, then retreating away.
Ravenclaw: Seohyun, Yoona. The star students, really. Yoona especially is someone I consider very smart to keep her career so steady despite not being the best at singing/dancing/acting -visuals aside, she has learned the tricks of the trade, continues to practice her skill-set, and kept herself at the top shelf of stars in S Korea. Seohyun is just Ravenclaw through and through -diligent, rule-abiding, academically-inclined and maintains an air of formality.
Gryffindor: Hyoyeon, Sooyoung The entire group is bright and loud -esp in variety shows, but these two always stand out for being extra savage. They let out the extra roars. They also get extra points for best hair-flips in the industry, and we all know how much a lion loves its mane.
Honorary mention: Jessica. Honestly, I'd say Slytherin too. Or Ravenclaw. But Slytherin a bit more.
Subjects they would excel in: Hyoyeon: Not much into the schooling, but the best witch in Hogwarts at flying. She's in the Quidditch team for sure. Sooyoung: Transfiguration (she secretly just wants to learn how to change her hair anytime she wants) Seohyun: -all rounder- does well in every subject, and is definitely Head Girl material. Yoona: Potions (I've seen so much of her cooking videos that given the right practice, she would excel in potions) Taeyeon: Divination (idy why, but i feel she is really into mysticism) Yuri: Defence against the Dark Arts (again, she's not someone to mess with- she seriously has the most intimidating 'What You Looking At?' eyes, and she'd definitely ace this subject Tiffany: Charms, obviously. Sunny: She's probably spend more time chasing the cutest boys in school, but I see her having a lot of fun in Care of Magical Creatures (i remember watching an episode where she had to catch a chicken, but I'm sure she would perform better with magical animals that she finds cute).
Honorary mention: Jessica. Charms. She and Tiff would be great to watch duel each other sending a range of fairy-like spells. Tiffany would send pink sparks and jess could send icy sparks.
PATRONUS. Hyoyeon: Leopard Sooyoung: Palomino horse Taeyeon: Night Owl Yuri: Dolphin Seohyun: Golden Retriever Yoona: Swan Tiffany: Flamingo Sunny: White rabbit",0,10

I was not sure to buy it but I ended with buying the album. I know im stupid to start researching after I bought it, but I found sellers name on a 50/50 legit autograph seller list, and compering it to other autographs I kinda think its fake as I haven't yet seen Tiffany have a heart at the start of her autograph. She always end it with a heart on her Y. and the rest look to messy, Taeyeon butterfly is not like how she signe it. Even the seller didn't respond on my messages about this. So I'm asking for help to what you boys and girls think if this is real or fake before I post a feedback to warn others or thank the seller.

226,2017-8-13,2017,8,13,20,6teo2b,Fan Account from Jessica's On Cloud 9 Fanmeet in Seoul,geegeebb,1502624474,"Fresh out of the fanmeet here, thought I'd share this before my memory fades ~.~

- Though the show was called a fanmeeting, it definitely felt like a concert. Jessica mostly performed songs and there were barely any speaking portions. Not complaining though, we got to see her perform so many songs from all her albums!

- There was one interview VCR before the second section which had Jessica just sitting on a couch wearing this oversized suit (be still, my heart D:) talking about her work.

- In the VCR she mentioned that her 20s were mostly about working hard nonstop but that she hopes she'll be more at ease and confident in her 30s. She talked about how she had a dream where she was playing the piano and it made her pick it up again (she used to play before). Apparently the same thing happened with sushi? (She couldn't eat it until she had a dream about doing it... idk)

- Also in the VCR she talks about how she's a very frank person and doesn't tend to hide what she's feeling, so the fact that her job requires her to be so careful about everything she says and does can be hard sometimes.

- She talked about how the name Golden Stars was created. After leaving GG she was scared to be on her own for the first time, but seeing so many people supporting her felt reassuring and it was beautiful like a starry sky.

- The VCR went on for (what felt like) a really long time and it felt very honest and sad, I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one tearing up a little. After that she performed some happy songs (Celebrate) but the knot in the chest was still there.

- Her stage for Dear Diary was touching, after that VCR it  made me think of the lyrics in a different way.

- After one of the VCRs she showed up on stage wearing a sexy black ensemble feat. an off-the-shoulder top and choker and everyone freaked out. It was definitely a change from her usual image that personally I was not expecting. When she performed How Deep Is Your Love (is that the right title?) I suffered a little from the ambulance fangirl sitting behind me but the stage itself was just wow...

- During Tonight, the music stopped suddenly and fans started singing the chorus while holding a sign saying ""You were my decade"". At first she thought it was a technical issue, but she was touched by the event and asked us to sing again.

- She asked to take a photo and came to the first row to sit between two girls from Hong Kong (I think they were from HK?). I was in the row behind Jessica two seats to the side and I couldn't believe the situation when she came over D:

- She interacted with fans a lot throughout the show, asking us where we're from and joking around, walking between the seating sections as she sings... She always seemed happy and she said she received a lot of energy tonight from the fans.

- Overall it was a great show and you can tell she put a lot of effort into it. She seemed genuinely thankful for how the audience was so energetic and supportive.

That's as much as I remember rn, I'm sure there'll be plenty of fan photos and videos later but I hope this gives an idea of how the show went.",5,28

Just wanted to voice some thoughts and get some feedback on what everyone else thought about this comeback. 
Compared to past SNSD stages and comebacks, I feel like this one wasn't as ""all-in""....do you guys agree?
I mean,  they look and sound amazing...but a couple things bothered me:

1. Their hair...you can clearly see Taeyeon's and Tiffany's extensions, which you could not really tell before. I wonder if they got a new stylist? Compared to other comebacks, the hairs (Except for Hyoyeon's and Sunny's) don't really look as different as they usually strive to be.

2. I think there is definitely a difference between the quality of their stages (not their perfrmances on their part, but the actual stage and camera work) for ""Holiday"" and ""All night"" vs. for example [Mr Mr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsU9V-A7QXE)

3. Their promotion time...I feel like this is vocalized a lot but needed to be listed anyways. They just hit a huge mile stone and it has been squeezed inbetween EXO and NCT Dream.....for a week....not to mention that other people on twitter have stated other ways that this comeback has been a little bit botched in regards to release times and not stocking the albums and what not.

4. Style and song choice. I listed this last because I know it differs depending on taste but the styling for ""Holiday"" is really unflattering to me and like a weird 80's IGAB vintage quirky vibe....I also think that with the resources that SM has, ""Holiday"" probably wasn't the strongest song they could have picked for SNSD's 10th Anniversary comeback...it wasn't experimental either.

Anyways, please don't think I am criticizing the girls...This is just the first comeback I've been a part of and I don't think it's living up to what I thought it'd be? ",3,3

I see comments as: ""I miss this old dorky Taeyeon"", ""I miss when she laughed like that"". What has happened to her to cause this change?

I know, because I've seen Heechul say this before, that it seems that Taeyeon gets really upset with any criticism, he even said ""you shouldn't care for people that say bad things about you"", but it seems it is stronger than her. Was this the cause of the change that you say? Was there a specific moment that caused her to limit herself? Or was she changing little by little?",5,7
