I've coloured the answer text in white to avoid spoilers, but if you want to check them then just click the cell and it will show up in the text box above, or save a copy down to your computer and change the text colour back to black. I did purposefully make most of the questions somewhat challenging to separate the good sotbabs from the great sotbabs. :P Enjoy testing yourself on Soshi trivia, how many can you get? :)",20,15

122,2014-5-5,2014,5,5,6,24q16g,Consider Voting For Yoona For The Paeksang Most Popular TV Actress Award!,SirToki,1399239033,"Yoona and Yuri are both nominated for the most popular actress award, but while our Black Pearl is leading with 70+ percent of the votes in the movie category, Yoong is now behind Park Shin Hye by more than a percent in the TV category. It's a very close and huge race, a marathon if You will, because voting closes on May 24th. 

You can vote 10 times each day, and five votes costs one euro, which is roughly a can of coke. I realize that buying votes is frowned upon by the majority of people, but I'd like to ask You to not argue about that here, I'm not against anyone that doesn't want to spend on this, I'm merely informing anyone who has the means, and would like to support Yoona in her career, the chance to do so.

Download the android app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Hana.Mobile.PaekSangAwards2014Global

There is no IOS version.

Link Your Facebook account with the application in the settings menu, than purchase votes in the charge menu, the purchase works through Google wallet, if You have bought an android app before, it's exactly the same. Then vote for Yoona in the TV/Female section. 

[Here is a picture guide if my explanation was unclear.](http://i.imgur.com/pkDQNtr.jpg)

If every subscriber would buy one euro worth of votes, and voted today, I bet Yoona would shoot to the lead with a huge margin. I know that's utopistic, but I'm glad even if I get one SONE here to vote for Im Yoona. :)",1,13

232,2014-5-9,2014,5,9,21,254g06,Question to all /r/SNSD Redditors: what would YOU like to see from your mods and each other? :),arthurmauk,1399638460,"Hi guys, my name is Arthur, I've just been made a mod here on /r/SNSD and the first post I'd like to make is to ask all you friendly Sones here: **What would YOU like to see from your mods, and each other?** :)

Our community has been around for 3 years now and has recently just surpassed 10,000 subscribers. Every day we get loads of pictures, videos, fan art, covers, parodies and questions submitted to us. We want to keep our precious ""social lounge"" atmosphere where everyone is comfortable in dropping in to ask a question, whether you're a veteran Sone looking for the most obscure details, or a newbie Sone who'd just like a hand in distinguishing between the [YoonYulSeo triplets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APIyrCIkeWc) (don't worry, we were all there once! ;)

So please post here with your ideas about how we can improve your experience. Would you like to see your [best](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1ka3by/ayo_sone_i_made_a_list_of_snsd_shows_complete/) [submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1untiq/snsd_for_dummies_a_new_fans_guide/) permanently enshrined in the sidebar? Would you like to see [more](http://i6.minus.com/i3AGUb0nyyhss.jpg) [topical](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/OMt6u9lbO8I/maxresdefault.jpg) sidebar pics? Would you like to see themed week competitions or ""day of the week"" themed submissions?

And how would you like us to moderate your posts? This subreddit is for all of us after all, so would you prefer a more zero-tolerance, iron fist approach towards trolls, or a more laissez-faire approach where downvotes and reports will be enough? 

I'd like to take some time here and remind everyone that our subreddit does support personalised custom flairs so if you have any ideas about pimping your flair into something a bit more unique to show off on your posts and comments, please post here or send us mods a message with the text and colour and we'll get to it straight away!

Finally, I thought it might be fun to provide a profile of us mods here so that you get to know us a bit better and we don't feel so distant. So any mods who are interested in writing their own profile here, post a comment and I'll edit this post to include it. Those of you who aren't mods but want to introduce yourself to everyone anyway please do so here too, here's mine!

Hi guys, my name is Arthur and I'm a 24 year old guy living in London. I fell in bias with Tiffany ever since watching [this Hello Baby clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t_v52e-Kcs) and I admire her tireless work ethic and courageous determination to succeed. I've actually only been a Sone since August 2012 but what I say is that what I lack in knowledge and experience, I try to make up for in passion and enthusiasm. \^^ As the first mod to be from the [22% of us in Europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/23duk5/results_of_our_2014_census/), I pledge faster response times to mod messages and reports, and together we can hopefully achieve [24 hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5oENXeoNM) coverage. That's all for now, thanks for listening and I'm looking forward to reading and responding to your ideas! :)

I'm 22 from the Bay Area in California. I've been a Sone since late 2009 around Gee/Genie promotions. YoonA is my bias but Jessica and Taeyeon come in pretty close. I'm a pretty big collector both physical goods and pictures/videos. I've been to all of the concerts they've attended (except for Hollywood Bowl 2009). I've seen and met a few of the members.

I've seen this subreddit grow from only a couple thousand subs to over 10,000 as it was today. Lots of things have improved since and the community is more active than ever with new posts every day. I use to be pretty active posting but I've been preoccupied with my job. Nowadays I mostly lurk and mod the topics. ",57,38

I was just wondering if there is an up-to-date list of (still active) fansites? I'm mostly interested in the YoonA ones.

I'm currently registered on:

1. [myyoona](http://myyoona.com/xe/)
2. [chunyoon](http://chunyoon.com/bbs/zboard.php?id=index)
3. [yoonaya](http://www.yoonaya.com/main)
4. [limyoona](http://limyoona.dothome.co.kr/xe/main)
5. [thegoddess](http://thegoddess0530.com/index.php/)
6. [kissingyoon](http://kssyll.cafe24.com/xe/main ), although I think they lost most of their data and not sure where I can get their older photos now T__T
7. [valentinedeer](http://valentinedeer.com/)
8. [yooniverse](http://yooniverse530.com/xe)
9. [yoonyul](http://www.yoonyul.com/)

I was also wondering what happened to the fansite Pure Sky, if anybody knows? I know they were pretty active and had really nice photos. They did a photobook but I can't seem to find their site anymore.

I found a Pure Sky compilation from 2012, but not the actual site or a full site download.

And a last question, is anyone registered on deeryoona.com? [This page](http://deeryoona.com/guide.html) tells you to email the owner if you're a foreigner and want to join (you normally need a Korean ID), but I haven't received an answer yet in 3 weeks :/

Thanks in advance for anyone able to answer some questions!",9,12

You read a headline like this 

&gt;After the girls wrapped up their promotions for single ""Mr. Mr,"" the girls has gone their ways to do solo activities. Jessica and her sister f(x)'s Krystal are getting ready to have their own reality show which is titled, 'Cover Girl.' YoonA attended a CHANEL fashion show in Dubai; while Sunny is the new DJ for MBC FM4U's 'FM Date.' For the other girls, not much news is happening for them.

source http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/91668/20140515/girls-generation-hits-the-billion-mark-when-it-comes-to-video-views-on-youtube.htm


Since Mr.Mr. promotions ended they've gone separate ways and we don't even know what half of them are doing. It feels like a dead period for the rest of the year. As if they'll just show up for a 3month comeback next year. Wasn't there an english album in the making. Or another sub unit album. Did that not work out because of money or the bad press they got during mr.mr with aging out of kpop? Could be lots of things to consider. 

Thoughts?

I feel as though it's hard to be a new SONE now. Myself, I found out about Girls' Generation toward the end of The Boys era, and I have been hooked since. However, since I found out later in the game, the only promotion cycles I have been able to experience with SNSD is I Got A Boy and Mr.Mr. - both of which were short (one month.)  
  
I understand they're wanting to branch out into Japan (and I love a lot of their Japanese songs), but it feels hard to stay hooked when there are long periods of time without promotion like what you would see in Korea. :/ idk. It just feels like a lot of waiting now and, while I want what's best for the girls, my heart aches and longs for their next release or what's around the corner.  
  
I keep thinking about what it must have felt like to wait every week for a new episode of Hello Baby, or to anticipate Soshi's new comeback coming in a short few months. Waiting a year for each new single seems like a really long time. :(  
  
Am I the only one feeling this way?",8,4

The tracks would be named like:

* Player (Title track)
* Galaxy Supernova (Korean)
* Beep Beep (Korean)
* Flower Power (Korean)
* Cheap Creeper (Korean)
* Player (English)
* Cheap Creeper (English)
* Galaxy Supernova (English)
* Videogame
* Fantasy
* Final Standing
* Game Over
* f(x)'s ""Toy"" or ""No more""

The case would be like a game case (like what they did for pink tape) it would say like Players: 1-9, quality, the rating and everything",10,14

**Time**: Everyday at 8pm KST (7am EST)

**How to listen live**: Tunein app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunein-radio/id418987775?mt=8)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player) (Search for [MBC FM4U](http://tunein.com/radio/MBC-FM4U-919-s14582/)) or via the MBC Mini app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mbc-ladio-mini/id384041016?mt=8)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imbc.mini&amp;hl=en)/[Web](http://mini.imbc.com/)

**Can't listen live?** Depending on where you live it might be hard to listen live without destroying your sleep schedule. Don't lose hope though because there are several ways to listen to the show:

- [The official podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sseoniui-fmdeiteu/id698570415?mt=2) - One issue with this method is that all of the music is removed. So if you're just looking to hear Sunny's voice this is the best option

- [Soshified audio archive](http://www.soshified.com/forums/forum/31-audio-downloads/) - bhost909 generously uploads the full recording every day and I'm sure others would step in if bhost909 ever needs a break

- Twitter Accounts - sykus322 points out that there are several twitter accounts that upload the recording every day: [@dc_fanatic](http://twitter.com/dc_fanatic)

- Record it yourself - There are a few options to accomplish this and all of them require a computer that is always turned on or at least asleep. I personally use audiohijack pro to record the stream using vlc (on a schedule). This option is only available for macs though and it is not a free solution. I set my destination folder to dropbox which auto uploads it to the cloud where I can access it using my phone. I use Documents by Readdle (free) to automatically sync that dropbox folder and use colored labels to keep track of the episodes that I've listened to. I'm sure there are similar alternatives on android. For those of you using this solution you'll need the direct stream url: http://tunein.imbc.gscdn.com:8003/

**Official Links**:

- [Official Website](http://www.imbc.com/broad/radio/fm4u/mbcdate/index.html)

- [Official Pictures](http://www.imbc.com/broad/radio/fm4u/mbcdate/photo/index.html)

- [Official Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/mbcfmdate) - Many photos of Sunny are posted here

**Translations**: There are several websites and twitter accounts that actively translate Sunny's dialogue. Here are a few:

- [Sunnys Daily Tumblr](http://sunnys-daily.tumblr.com/) - this blog posts small translations, but I'm not sure if this person is translating or just reposts it from another source. It all depends on how you want to consume your content

- [@itsakyo on Twitter](http://twitter.com/itsakyo) - Thank you sykus332 for the suggestion

- [@DJ_Sunny_Subber](http://twitter.com/DJ_Sunny_Subber) - A great account that posts translations, news and playlists (credit: sykus332)
 
**Days that the Show is Pre-recorded**: 23,24,25th of May Sunny will be out of town for their Japan concert (credit: sykus332)

**Other Links**:

- [Taeyeon's call to Sunny Subbed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IcDwlOefTA) (credit: arthurmauk)

If I left anything out please let me know and I'll add it straight away. Have fun listening!


Edit: Thank you sykus332 and arthurmauk for the helpful additions.

Edit 2: Wow thank you so much to the kind Sone for the reddit gold. Life achievement unlocked! hehe :)",16,28

For Tiffany's upcoming 26th birthday on 1st August 2014, Complete Bliss (a Tiffany fansite) is making a message book to give to Tiffany. Please help them by writing a short message to Tiffany, in English or in Korean! (:

My answers to the 5 questions:

*1) Tiffany is 000000 0000000. (you must write two words)*

Tiffany is hard-working and courageous.

*2) What about Tiffany makes you crazy? (please tell me one thing)*

Tiffany's eye-smiling optimism drives me crazy. \^^

*3) From all of Tiffany's songs, which one is your favorite?*

From all of Tiffany's songs, her most recent cover ""The Way"" by Ariana Grande is my favourite. It really demonstrated how much she has improved as a vocalist over the past few years. The power and control Tiffany has over her vocals is impeccable as she coos and croons her way through the short excerpt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s63W_bhcBU

*4) What song would you like Tiffany to sing? (please write the title of the song and the singer)*

The song that I would like Tiffany to sing the most is ""I Love You"" by Kim Taeyeon. (;

*5) Message you would like to say to Tiffany.*

""Pany-ah, thank you so much for introducing so much joy and friendship into my life, I hope you remain happy and healthy. Happy birthday, let's go on for a long time! (:""",0,27

""[TRANS] Today is the most embarassing day of my life!


Today l took a ight from Osaka to Korea. Since the Korea airplane was
a small one, there were only 8 rows of seats which consist of economic
class and rst class. My seat was at the 2nd row, but [My Child]'s mood
seemed to be bad today, he kept on crying.


Alter crying for around 20 minutes, the kind-hearted passengers sitting
in front of me helped me to comfort [My Child]. They are really pretty! Until
the passenger sitting right in front of me turned her head back, I
screamed ""Girls' Generation! ! !"" in my heart!


I was so lucky to sit behind Taeyeon, Seohyun, Tiffany and Hyoyeon!
Since [My Child] cried too miserably, these 4 pretty girls helped me to
comfort him! And wanted to give him some toy gifts! Even the
manager who sat beside me was intended to oomfort [My Child] too! The
vice-captain + 4 stewardess came to help alsol But [My Child] didn't even
stop crying@@ Today's one of the most embarassing day in my life!""

669,2014-5-28,2014,5,28,7,26n6ge,Some updates to /r/SNSD: useful links and changelog,arthurmauk,1401228549,"Hi guys, since my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/254g06/question_to_all_rsnsd_redditors_what_would_you/) as mod asking you all what you'd like from this subreddit, I've been tinkering away trying to improve things for everyone. Just to keep the communication channels clear and transparent, here's a list of things that I've updated, which can also serve as a changelog for future purposes. :)

1) The sidebar has been updated to include some useful links. This includes:

 * [Up-to-date Soshi picture gallery](http://darkhand340.minus.com/uploads) by Darkhand340

 * [Soshi variety show compilation](http://soshishows.blogspot.com/) by /u/iminatardis

 * [SNSD for dummies](http://snsdfordummies.wordpress.com/) by /u/notajenius 

2) The [Rules &amp; FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/wiki/index) page has also been updated to include the above links and also compilations of SNSD's [English](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1ukb4j/compilation_snsd_english_cover_songs_performances/) and [Korean](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1ukb73/compilation_snsd_korean_cover_songs_performances/) covers by /u/YoonASNSDFan. The idea is that we can start a mini ""Hall of Fame"" where the best Sone Redditor submissions can have a permanent in the subreddit, helping out all Sones new and old alike in the future! \^^

3) The submission text will now remind you to check if your image has the highest possible quality by using [Google Reverse Image Search](http://youtu.be/t99BfDnBZcI) or [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/). I'm asking the mods of /r/kpics if we can use their [helpful gif](https://mediacru.sh/q155Mj1WMCFd) teaching people how to Reverse Image Search on Chrome, but if not maybe someone can make an /r/SNSD one. :)

EDIT: Sone Redditor and Wallpaper-maker extraordinaire /u/Fuguzors has generously [made one specifically for /r/SNSD](https://mediacru.sh/yb3TQmEVnPcN), you'll now be reminded of it every time you submit a new post, thanks Fugu! :) 

4) I asked what style of moderation you guys would prefer, and out of the 9 people who replied, 7 responded that we can err on the hawkish side, 2 responded that we should continue being neutral, and 0 responded that we should be more lenient. Therefore we will try to moderate according to your preferences. Of course we won't be overly harsh on one-off misunderstandings, it's only when persistent spite is apparent when we are forced to take any action.

See the Basic Rule on the sidebar to the right: ""Inappropriateness will not be tolerated. Please do not disrespect any members."" So when you post, just take a moment to consider whether the members would approve of your post, and that should be enough. :)

5) The sidebar pic seems to be a popular topic but it's a big project so we will look into revamping that in the future in a way that is both useful and regularly updated. Watch this space!

That's all for now, let me know what you guys think of these little changes and what more we should do to better our subreddit, because open communication is so important for improvement, thanks for reading! :)",17,41

As I suggested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/25ctya/heavenly_forest_jessica_fansite_full_site_download/), I compiled some fansites to share with /r/SNSD for YoonA's birthday.

I'm posting it a bit earlier so it wouldn't get ignored when people start posting pictures/albums for YoonA's birthday. Hope you enjoy the photos!

* [Chunyoon](https://mega.co.nz/#!w1V2hDAY!nVoZ9wqE_9dddnCm7ofHhqqpLxizUg2u9yYldbY8UZk): 584 pictures

* [Limyoona](https://mega.co.nz/#!49VwmZ4R!WQ8dD_GCNrd7b7gA3N2NoxdUR5UzDM0Tb_Y9bldxF4E): 483 pictures

* [Myyoona](https://mega.co.nz/#!9gVl3BrQ!D_JZSSbFw2N8tAjF4S7Dv6wHMpwFL-pr3NFW4n_we7A): 286 pictures

* [Yoonaya](https://mega.co.nz/#!9sdCAYaY!Ejpz2ZrUVMxRMf4Z8MAxuFxU1x-al3RenkjZlG6ZZXU): 1.369 pictures

Some information:

* There should be 2.722 pictures in 275 folders in all downloads combined.

* For Chunyoon, I did not include pictures that specifically said ""Please only view on chunyoon"" and the ones I didn't have access to. As it is stated in the guidelines on chunyoon.com:
&gt; Please do not share and reupload the data with the special mention (Pz Do not share and see only in chunyoon.com)

* I manually saved every picture, so it is possible some photos are missing and/or there are doubles, so apologies in advance if that's the case. I did put a *lot* of work into this, so I hope people will like it. \^^

* I copied the name and dates of the events for the folders from the respective fansites and didn't double check them.

Full credit of the pictures go to their respective owners, copyright as tagged. If you do like the pictures, I hope you can support the fansites:

* [chunyoon](http://chunyoon.com/)

* [myyoona](http://myyoona.com/)

* [limyoona](http://limyoona.dothome.co.kr/xe/main)

* [yoonaya](http://yoonaya.com/)

And to finish this post, a request from the fansites: please do not efface or remove the logo when spreading pictures. Credit the original sources!

Happy YoonA Day!",5,56

The TV commercial for the SNSD 1-Night Special Concert will be mass advertised from 6/1 around Japan, focusing on Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka

Anyone know more about this?

I'll be in Japan on that date so I'm definitely interested to find out how to attend, and if anyone else is going, since it's usually very difficult to attend their shows in Japan, be sure to watch for this!",3,17
