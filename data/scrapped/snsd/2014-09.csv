I would also like to take a moment to mention, after this whole ""fappening"" thing... what are the possibilities of the girls being exposed like that? I doubt they actually have nudes or anything of the sort mainly because I feel that A. they have a good character, B. they support and trust each other, C.

First, I added a new [TTS ""Holler""](https://www.etsy.com/listing/203264179/taetiseo-tts-holler-k-pop-t-shirt-snsd?) t-shirt, and I decided to simplify the album design a bit. 

Based on the responses to the survey I rolled out last time I posted, I have decided to switch to USPS First Class shipping for U.S. customers, which saves you about $2 on each order. I have also added the following items to the store, mostly based off of requests in the survey:

[APink t-shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/200496478/a-pink-lips-k-pop-t-shirt-apink-a-pink?)

[Super Junior ""Mamacita"" t-shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/202903565/super-junior-mamacita-style-kpop-t-shirt?)

Those styles are always popular, so I figured I would add the most requested groups. 

Lastly, I added some [Crayon Pop polo shirts,](https://www.etsy.com/listing/203276701/crayon-pop-gummi-bar-bar-bar-polo-shirt?ref=listing-shop-header-1) similar to the ones in the ""Bar Bar Bar"" video. All 5 members are available. 

I know those groups aren't relevant to /r/SNSD, but since so many of you took the survey and requested them I wanted to let you know. 

As always, the coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** is active for 15% off you total purchase. If you have any questions, requests, or comments, just message me. Thanks!

202,2014-9-14,2014,9,14,5,2gbb0b,Which albums should I buy?,XyHavix,1410638748,"I finally decided to buy their albums instead of loading up YouTube playlists. However, I'm having trouble picking out which ones to buy. I am pretty set on getting The Best as that has the majority of songs that I liked. However, I noticed that this album was for the Japanese versions of the songs. 

I was wondering if they released any type of equivalent for the Korean versions of the songs or would I have to buy each individual album if I wanted to go that route? The songs I'm really looking for are Gee, RDR, Hoot, IGAB, and The Boys.

EDIT: Much love to all the responses. Having the physical album itself was important enough to me that I decided that I would be buying The Best, Girls Generation (2011), The Boys, IGAB, RDR, and the Hoot albums. Thank you all for the help

I assume most of you all have had time to give Holler a few (probably more :P) listen-throughs so let's talk about it! I guess my prevalent quesions are:

1. What was your first impression?
1. What's your favorite track so far?
1. How does it compare (in your eyes) to Twinkle? (i.e. image, sound, etc.)

**Edit** while this might still be getting some traffic. It seems that most people enjoy Adrenaline the most (same for me) and think that Holler does not live up to Twinkle, both as a track and EP. However we (obviously) don't hate it, and my guess is that over time we might warm up to it a bit more. Also, and this is my personal opinion, Holler would be slightly better if it didn't have that guy talking in the beginning...",22,15

Been playing this for the past couple weeks, highly addicting!

However, its a bunch of SMTown artists (old and new).   
EXO-K/M, Super Junior/-M, SHINee, TVXQ!, BoA, Girls' Generation (:D), f(x), Red Velvet, TTS, etc...  

They even already have Holler as a playable song!
Great replay value.  Obviously offers in-app purchases, but all songs are free, and gameplay is good too!

Game is only officially available in South Korea (Google Plan and iTunes).  
You'll have to change your locale for iTunes, or just d/l an .apk for Android.

This is one of the few places (in english) that is talking about it.  Hope you guys enjoy this post :)

I thought I'd list a few facts about the house from S1 for those who do not intend to watch it. It's not necessary to watch S1 but I'd recommend doing so if you want to learn about the S1 cast. The dynamics between the original members can probably be picked up as you watch S2.

Room 5 is the only one located on the ground floor.  
Each room has an attached bath, and there's a general bath on each floor.

Adding 7 members to replace the 6 who left required a makeover for some of the rooms (5 and 3).  

There used to be [individual beds in 3](http://i.imgur.com/QIjL7dp.png) (Nana and Hong Soo Hyun) and a [bunk bed in 5](http://i.imgur.com/ttI0EDC.png) (Min Woo + Kang Jun).

I'm a bit iffy about it. I don't like Stay and Eyes because they are plain boring. Holler and Adrenaline are alright with Adrenaline being the better one (especially the choreography hehe). Only You is good and Whisper has to be my favorite from the album. 

I think that because the first TTS album was so good, it set our expectations unbelievably high for this one. I felt like SM could have done better regardless of the first album's success though. The songs were much more different than what I was expecting, but not the good kind of different. 

All in all, I'm slightly disappointed. Whisper is the only song I will even consider going on my playlist. How about you guys? And please give your raw and honest thoughts.  ",10,5

I've been a Sone for 2 years now and never took the time to learn Hangeul because I thought it would be difficult and pointless, but boy was I wrong - I've just learnt it in a day and it's been easy and fun! 

The site I used was this: **http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/Learn_hangeul** which is fantastic, has everything you need to know including sound and video file examples partnered up with the [Talk To Me In Korean team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqFGHMxWtYk&amp;feature=player_embedded). Follow all the instructions and you'll get a really solid foundation for the alphabet. Try and complement this learning with your K-pop and Korean food knowledge! The first word I learnt was  (goguma, or sweet potato, Seohyun's favourite)! :P

The other resource is the popular ""Learn to Read Korean in 15 Minutes"": **http://www.ryanestrada.com/learntoreadkoreanin15minutes/index.html** I was sceptical about this when I first started and I used this as a clean-up review after I had finished with the wiki above, but it was a pleasant surprise that it was actually very useful and accurate! So though you won't get as much depth with this, you will get all the basics in a very short period of time, utilising mnemonics to help you remember the characters, so if you don't have even a day, 15 minutes will get you pretty far.

Hope these help you feel closer to the girls, good luck,  !! \^^",15,46

Being a sone for such a long time and listening to all their songs and loving every single one, watching them on variety shows and seeing how happy all of them are together. How could something likw this happen? I would never in a million years think this wouldved ever happen to Girls Generation. Hearing this news already hurted so much, and then getting confirmation and knowing that this is real and that she willbe leaving. It even hurts me more that she will be there for one more album and then will officially be out of Girls Generation, if i was Jessica i would be crying so hard to hear something like that. Well i am already crying so hard for something like this to happen. But i want all of you sones to know that never stop supporting Girls Generation and Jessica. Even though this is a hard time for us we must keep on supporting and loving Girls Generation no matter the situation. I hope for the beat for SNSD and Jessica.

612,2014-9-30,2014,9,30,14,2hv714,SNSD is a Generation. Not a Person :(,tFaYue,1412056644,"Hello,

So though there are many posts like this already I wanted to toss in my condolences. However we much remember that no individual member makes up Girls Generation. neither is it it the 9 girls together. it's the community they created. the feelings they shared. the friendships born. Other people may hear about this and just look at it as another music group losing members which in reality is common. BUT they are not any group. They are special. it is not just that they are pretty or they sing good or blah blah blah. They are 9 individuals who created something special in all our hearts. they have brought happiness into so many lives that could not be found anywhere else. Even if they are down to 8 i will follow them wherever they go! But i will also follow Jessica. She is and always will be an important member and even if they don't perform together she is merely on a separate path. If i'm asked how many members are in Girls Generation i will say 9. Take TTS for example they are just 3 girls but we still see them as Girls Generation. Sub groups or individual performances don't take away from the whole. it only makes it stronger. let's take a moment and realize just by the activity on this subreddit just how many people have been affected by SNSD. I know they are not dead and to me they never will be but i have to say: 

Girls Generation, I love you, thank you for everything you have given me, i will always remember you to the end of my days and i will do my best to spread your gifts to the next generation. ",2,5

I have honestly never really posted anything because I fear failure and not being noticed, but my heart has been ripped from me and I think we all share this feeling!
I remember little Taeyeon standing on a bridge screaming ""I can do this"" into the night. I remember their first live debut. Girls Generation means a lot to many people. They've been a support system in a time of stress. They have given us hope and joy. They are our family and we are theirs. We've been with them from step one up till now and nothing can change this, even if they are separated. We have cried with them, and laughed with them, and sung with them, We've loved them through thick and thin. Jessica for me is my bias and it hurts my heart, but SNSD wouldn't be SNSD with out all 9 of them. So, Today we will cry. We will watch every episode of every concert, drama, game, and reality show they were on together. We will go through time and listen to every song from debut to now. We will stop. Reality will settle in. Then we will stand strong together as sones. We will support all 9 even if they are split. And we will fight with the girls together. ~FIGHTING!~",3,20

I've come up with some stream of consciousness things and I invite folks to add to it:

- Tiffany is now on Short Team, and can claim to be ""right in the middle"" no more.
- ""Oh!"" is going to be extremely awkward. Think about it.
- Who will do her lines? I'm thinking Fany will do singing ones that are lower in pitch while Seohyun and sometimes Sunny will do the more high-pitched lines, and some of her spoken lines will be given to the dance squad , probably Sooyoung because of her English pronunciation. 
- In parts for example (""The Boys"", ""Genie"") where she is harmonizing with Taeyeon ",15,18

641,2014-9-30,2014,9,30,22,2hvw5h,My Opinion on SNSD's Jessica News,StarryNight44,1412082173,"This is just my opinion and I apologize if this causes an uproar but here we go. 

The news about Jessica's departure didn't surprise me. That it was her that left, sure that kinda did but in general it didn't and here's why: SNSD has been on top for years.  I didn't want to be a negative nelly but after a while I started to feel like something was going to bring them down. Look at Britney Spears, one minute she's on top of the world and next she's having a mental breakdown and shaving her head.  Demi snapped and punched a girl. Just Beiber is now a wangster and getting arrested left and right. 

Every musical group hits a rough spot and now it's SNSD's turn. Looking at the announcement SM made because of the events, it sounds like Jessica was going to take a break after the next album release. I feel the other members knew this be it a marriage, design school, her company, whatever.  So, in the downtime of SNSD, Jessica launched her business which I originally thought was great timing but then, a business is a lot of work, of which I'm sure she was excited for and had everything she needed to start so she did which put SM into a pickle.  So they decided to let her go/kick her out whatever, and were trying to find the right time to announce it. 

Now, if SM had anounced this at a time they wanted, everyone would. Have been more prepared for the news and for the final OT9 performance, but I'm guessing when Jessica heard the news of pushing up the date of promoting as a group of 8, she announced it herself. Then the internet blew up which is why they didn't release a statement earlier. They probs tried to get a hold of Jessica to talk things over and whatnot. 

Now, SNSD recently renewed their contracts for 3 more years, and then this news broke out that she left or was kicked out. I believe the contracts were for SM in general and not for the group SNSD, this would explain why she hasn't left SM Entertainment as a whole. Now, because SM said she decided to halt promotions after next album, it sounds like she would always be able to come back as a member, but then Jessica said she was kicked out. 

Overall, be it because of an inpending marriage, her company, or design school, i feel like there is another reason no one is telling us behind the scenes. I won't boycott SNSD's music because I like it but I already accepted what has happened and will continue to follow the group both as a group and individually. 

On a last note, Krystal may or may not follow Jessica and the one reason I think she could is because I feel like Jessica is Krystal's rock and without Jessica she will have a hard time in the idol world. I at least got a glimpse of that while watching their reality show. 

Thank you for reading. 


Addition:
--
I think the timeline of everything went like this - Jessica was in NY for whatever reason and was planning on racing back home to South Korea to join the rest of the members in China. Sometime along the way she gets notification from SM that she is out of the group. This leads to her posting on her Weibo account. When SM told Jessica, they told the other members of the group right before they headed out to the airport, basically blindsiding them. I feel like they knew she would catch up with them at the airport. This would explain why they all look devastated, especially Hyoyeon, in all of the pictures even though they expected her for one more year.
