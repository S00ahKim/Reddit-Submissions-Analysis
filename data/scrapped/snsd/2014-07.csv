This experience sounds so amazing to me and I just feel so unhappy that I didn't go. Are there any others here that attended and what was your experience like? And would you say it was the best SNSD concert you've been to (only applies if you went to other concerts of them) ? ",25,9

I am going to once again retire the I Got a Boy member emblem shirts soon, but first I decided to put them in a package with the Air GG baseball shirts in my store for a discount. Basically, you can get both shirts representing your SNSD bias for a discount of a few bucks. If you're new to /r/snsd or have never ordered from me, take some time to check them out.

Also don't forget to use coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** for 15% off your order (which makes these bias bundles a really good deal).

In other news, I apologize for not having many new designs up lately. I've been really busy with work and my mom has fallen into poor health. I promise I will be coming up with new SNSD stuff as quick as I can, along with other K-pop shirts too. If you have any suggestions or groups you'd like to see, pm me and I'll see what I can do.

Thanks, as always, and I'll be around if you need anything!",13,23

I'm really glad that I was introduced to SNSD, I will always continue to support them until the end. So how long have you been a SONE? What's your story?

Here is the translated version of the post: 

----------------------------------------
------------------------------------
------------------------------------

Although I wouldn't know as much as SONEs \^^ ;

I wrote a couple concept ideas that wouldn't be bad for the girls

**1) Girl Pirates**

If they make a comeback in the summer, it'd be ""refreshing"" and charismatic

**2) Killer** 

Doesn't it match this year's comeback? I feel like this concept will fit them and have a lot of charisma to it

**3) Office Lady**

If the girls were regular people, they would probably be no different than other normal people right? Maybe a staff worker at a company or student? (?) I think it'd fit them real well if each member was assigned a job and had an office-lady comeback",0,8

This is the thread to state who is going to KCON, and if they'd like to meet up, and what they'd like to do :D. 

I'm organizing a meetup with several Soshified members and I think I can combine all of us. If you guys don't mind you may want to make Soshified accounts if you don't have them (or post in my thread there if you do in Social Lounge - KCON SONE Meetup) so we can add you to the masterlist of people going. 

We have a KakaoTalk group for easy communication so if you have KakaoTalk please state your username :) 

A lot of people want to hang out Friday night! 


**NEW UPDATE::::** 

We will be meeting at the Ramada Wilshire in Ktown at 6pm on Friday. We're meeting IN THE LOBBY - no need to rent a meeting room. I called and asked if it was OK, they said yes, as long as we don't hang out for hours. We will then go on foot to find food and fun.


* Ramada Los Angeles Wilshire Center
* 3900 Wilshire Blvd
* Los Angeles, CA 90010
* 1 block west (above ground) of Wilshire/Western subway station on Wilshire Blvd.
* (Purple Metro Line's last stop going West. In Koreatown.)

Hooray, adventures!!!!! Can't wait to see you all!!!


**Meetup Sat/Sun will be at the Soshified booth at 12PM.** I'll have a sign. You can also meet me in line if you're early. I plan to get to the con no later than 8am both days. I will again have a sign. :P 

If you do not have Kakao and do not wish to obtain Kakao please PM me for my cell #. Kakao would be useful however as we are in one giant conversation there. 

**WHO IS SITTING NEAR YOU?** 

See /u/rtanaka6 's list HERE: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/2a0mdd/kcon_2014_meetup_thread/cj6yjf0

Let's see what we can make happen! 

Tell us when you're going, where you're sitting, when you get to LA, and what nights you'd like to hang out / also if you'd like to hang out at the con/during the concert (if you're in a pit seat), what time you plan to arrive at KCON each day, and where you would like to meet the group. 

Thanks!!

Indestructible
Its gone by fast, hasnt it? The time flows on the way we are
Since when have we started thinking alike?
Fights, Silence, we do everything together
And even then, your voice gives me a feeling of relief


How you like me? With these new emotional arguments, its so hard
Its not easy, but it feels nice


This Indestructible Unbreakable bonds that can never be broken
Our soul is a twin soul (twin soul)


For example, even if it looks like youre about to fall from a cliff,
At least know that I wont let go of your hand
(Indestructible)
Because I will protect you until the end


Maybe its because of you, surprisingly I like myself
There are a lot of things I hate too, you know? And theyre starting to disappear


My dad said to me when I was very little,
Being with someone you love will make you a stronger person


Am I just confused now? I wonder if my feelings have been conveyed to you
Well, honestly I want to tell you about them now


Sometimes important things are just Invisible They cant be seen
So, Ive gotta say this to you over and over again (say to you)


If we were to break up and I didnt have to feel anything, well I would want to feel everything
This destiny
Thank you


Lets let this ship sail
Inside the raising (raising) wind
I will never surrender
Tie our numerous feelings together and
Head into the world which we have never ever seen


This Indestrictuble Unbreakable bonds that can never be broken
Its certainly our soul
For example, even if someone were to try and hurt me
No matter what happens, it will be alright


Important things are Invisible They cant be seen
So, I want to tell you over and over (want to tell you) Without you I wouldnt be here right now
This destiny


Indestructible
Indestructible

A lot of people think voting is useless, but I disagree. It's a competition to see who has the best fans on Billboard.com! Billboard is like the company that tracks songs in America. Anyways, I think it'd be nice for SNSD to get some exposure by winning these polls. So that's why I think it's important.

so, i am having second thoughts about buying snsd's the best first press (a.k.a. the cd+dvd one)...
i could really use your honest opinion about it, so if you can give it to me keep reading, i would apreaciate that a lot :D

the only ""but""s that are bothering me are:

-the fact that there are no subs at all (and i cant speak or read japanese); since there will be interviews of the members i wont get anything they are saying, and honestly that makes me frustrated

-4 of the songs included on the cd are from love&amp;peace album, which i already have; and i also prefer korean versions of the songs a lot more....

-it has no aditional good (i really like posters ok......xD)


i think what is really bothering me is fact that it has no english subs....i feel like they (producers) didnt even care....

but anyways i think it will be a great album. i just need some of your honest opinion.

 what would/will/did you do?

what do you think? is it worthy? ",9,10

Her name is a combination of her first and family names, so in casual conversation, is she Seohyun or Joo-hyun? And does Tiffany go by Stephanie at all anymore?

From what I've read, Billboard is apparently restricting the votes to a 30-second window every 30 minutes. The last window was at 11:18 Pacific, so the next should be at 11:48 Pacific, assuming these are right.

Every time it tells you that you've been blocked from voting, it's because they aren't accepting votes and aren't in that 30-second window. Same for when it says that your vote has already been counted.

Normally, I would've just assumed this was bullshit, but it actually happened to change from ""Your vote has already been counted"" at 11:17 to ""Thank you for voting!"" at 11:18, as users said it would, so I'm trusting it. Basically just rapidly vote in the few minutes before, during, and after the window to be safe. 


Next window is at 11:48 Pacific time, apparently. Basically just every XX:18 &amp; XX:48 time, the voting should be happening for thirty seconds somewhere in there.

I watched more MVs and started to know their names. Before the day ended, I had watched every MV from them at that point and knew all their faces. 

For about 3 weeks, I went on a variety show watching rampage where I was just watching and watching SNSD content and I thought everything Korean was great. I was sooooooo addicted, even my parents were worried. Then after those 3 weeks it calmed down and I started getting into other Kpop like BigBang and Shinee. I still remember that time clearly.

Also, with KCON right around the corner, I'm running a special deal. Instead of the usual 15% off discount for /r/SNSD, I'm bumping it to **20% off until August 10**! Just use the coupon **KCONGEAR** to get the discount!

Also, if you are in the U.S. and place your order by Monday, August 4, I will guarantee you receive your order in time for KCON. (Apologies to all of you outside the U.S... due to the tricky nature of international shipping times I can only guarantee that I will ship as quick as I can, not an exact date.)

Lastly, I made a survey to try to better the experience of shopping with KpopGear. Whether you've purchased from my store or not it would be really helpful if some of you could answer the questions for me. it's quick and easy and I want to improve as much as I can.
