78,2013-2-6,2013,2,6,1,17xsg9,A sort of an odd question for my fellow SONE's... ,TheRumbleofThunder,1360081373,"Has anyone ever had a bad experience being a SONE? What I mean is, has anyone ever called you names, made fun of you, or were mean to you for being a SONE? I absolutely adore all the girls, but recently I started becoming an even bigger fan as I discovered this amazing subreddit full of wonderful people, and had access to more english translations of the different shows they've had appearances on and such. This also gave me access to more of their history, and when someone would reference something, I'd go digging to find out what they were talking about. This led to the discovery of what a black ocean was, and SNSD's experiences with those. Not only that, but I also follow K-pop as a whole, and sometimes I notice people saying not so nice things about SONE's... Which hurts sometimes, being one myself. I've also had some experiences of my own when some of my friends, who are also into K-pop but fans of different groups, make fun of how much I absolutely adore SNSD. So, in the end, I was just wondering if anyone else had similar stories. 

Thanks for listening, being absolutely amazing people, and for creating a place where I can feel really welcome and understood. :)

EDIT: Thank you all for sharing your experiences, and giving your great advice. It was all helpful and fun to read. It's been a nice reminder to be who I am and not care what anyone else thinks or says. :)",38,35

I've wanted to post an update to my increasingly growing collection, so for my cakeday here it is.

**My channel:** https://www.youtube.com/user/Vaztes

Each individual member:

* [Seohyun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL525C438570490D1C&amp;feature=plcp) - (37)

Crazy change in numbers if you look back, especially for Taeyeon. I'm still sad that there's so few good Hyoyeon fancams out there.

Added a new playlist called [Soshi 9](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL406B46D87C8C3ED6) - (24)

I found and added 5 new Yoona fancams and 2 Sooyoung just this evening. I update as much as I can find new (good) fancams.

Last note. I add all fancams to my [**favorite list**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=FL2nTAkoaC-8k2j_ixrSRdkg&amp;feature=mh_lolz) which should make it a lot easier to check for newly added fancams in the comming future.",9,32

I've seen a lot of shirts, shoes, acessories that they wear but ,obviously, those are too 'girly' for a male like me to wear.
I guess some shirts and caps depending on the colors could be used by males but is there any stuff that was made exclusively for male audience?
I saw cool hoodies but as a guy Im not too confortable rocking a hoodie that says ' girls generation' on the street so i was looking forward for some more discrete things... Hope you guys can give me your opinions on this..

Just wanted to give an update to those interested in purchasing the ""I Got A Boy"" individual member logo stickers.

My friend and I spoke this week and he is pretty much ready to print.  I'm having him cut three of each logo so I will have something on hand to show everyone what they look like and when I start taking requests.  To make it easier for him, I'm only going to be doing the stickers in pink **at the moment**, like [the one I posted on my laptop](http://i.imgur.com/NeJGXuW.jpg).  They should also be around the same size as mine (approx 4-5"" wide) or a little smaller (the logos with leaves instead of wings).  They'll be $5 each, which includes postage and such.

The logos can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/SnpohIG.jpg)

a year ago...

(also my first post, reddit noob here, lets see if I'm doing it right) edit: nope didn't do it right... failed.

It was my final for Drawing I, I have since then completed Drawing II. With the skills I obtained in Drawing II, I want to touch up on this one.

I don't have a particular interest in Art, and I only draw when I feel like it. Mainly just a hobby but not something I spend too much time one

This portrait was done on Plate Bristol Board, mainly with 2H, H, HB, B, 2B and 4B. In some areas I attempted to use an 8B, but it didn't look any different than 8B so I gave up on it.

I know that things are misplaced, my former eyes would have said it was perfect, but it's much more obvious to me now. I'm contemplating whether to just draw a new one or not to compare the difference.

edit: Just for anybody wondering why I didn't draw Tiffany instead of Taeyeon for my final, I had trouble drawing people at the time, and was very worried I would destroy what Tiffany looked like, so I came up with the excuse of being unable to draw perfection.",12,40

It's been a couple of weeks, but we've finally added some more SNSD shirts to our web store. We've been very busy (thanks to all of you!), so I'm sorry it took us this long.

The new SNSD designs are:

[The Girls' Generation First Album Crown Logo](https://www.etsy.com/listing/123954723/girls-generation-snsd-crown-logo-t-shirt)

[I Got A Boy Heart Logo (as seen on Music Bank)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/124164784/girls-generation-snsd-i-got-a-boy-heart)

[I Got A Boy Diamond Logo (as seen on Music Bank)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/124165901/girls-generation-snsd-i-got-a-boy?ref=v1_other_1)

The SNSDREDDIT coupon code is still active for all of you wonderful people, so use it to get 15% off all orders. 

Also, the [member emblem shirts](https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250491/girls-generation-snsd-taeyeon-emblem-t) will be getting discontinued soon, so if you haven't gotten yours yet (or if you want another one!), do it quick!

One note about shipping: The U.S. Post Office raised their shipping rates, and for international shipping it went up quite a bit. I am currently charging as little as I possibly can on international shipping (I actually lose money for certain countries still), but it has increased since some of you last ordered. I apologize, but I don't have any other shipping alternative. I did reduce the shipping price to Canada, though, which may be helpful to some of you.

Thank you all so much once again. As always, if you have any questions, suggestions or ideas please let me know!",34,37

[wiki SNSD Tours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation#Tours) - I'd also be interested in any of the SMtown DVDs, too, including the recent I AM DVD.

Quality wise, is one better than the others? And this can be in terms of video quality, performances, content, or whatever else you think of.

I've seen most of their concert performances on YouTube, so I just wanted some opinions on the DVDs themselves.

Since then the population of this subreddit has about tripled so I am here posting this again...

From what I know SM Entertainment doesn't advertise SNSD outside of S. Korea and Japan so how did you come to know about SNSD? Was it a friend or maybe you just stumbled onto one of their youtube videos?

For me it was my friend from Hong Kong showed me the video for Gee. At first I was like meh, then soon got addicted to it. Then he showed me Mr Taxi(my favourite song till date) and well that was the point were I wanted to hear every song and watch every MV they had released.

So please tell me... how did you discover SNSD?",104,25

It's getting really annoying, to the point where he constantly bothers me for SNSD pictures (so he can save them to his perverted little phone). How do I deal with this pervy friend?

I looked around and I couldn't find one (someone's gonna find one for me now lol) so I decided to quickly teach myself how to make gifs. Here's how it turned out: **http://i.imgur.com/8xhgZVY.gif**

* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format.

* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.

But, whilst watching Gee, I thought, ""I would really like to see this MV in HD"" so I just google what I wanted, couldn't find too much, so I just decide to download the MV to add to my collection.
...I opened the file... all seemed normal, and then I was hit with the most excruciating, horrific experience of my life. 

I had downloaded an anti video.. I couldn't stop watching.. I watched the whole thing.. It was mostly just subtitles, and every word I read, the worse I felt. And now here I sit, writing this.. trying to forget what I have just seen.

This is my first experience with a real anti video, ect.  I cant believe how some people can have so much hate for this group. But in the end, I know that they are just jealous. Jealous of SNSD. JEALOUS OF THE SONE'S. :) SO NYUH SHI DAE, HWAITING!
