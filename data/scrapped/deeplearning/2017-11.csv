Some articles seem to suggest that deep learning could be less affected when the input is flawed, such as if the finger was placed at an odd angle, compared to other methods. If this is true, why is this the case?


It's worth mentioning that this is not for any assessed work that I'm doing so my motive is purely curiosity. Also, the purpose of classifying fingerprints would be to reduce the search space for identification in databases.

This is my first question on Reddit and it's a dilemma I'm having about the approach to follow.

So I'm working on projects involving application of deep learning into the computer vision problem, primarily object detection and segmentation. Till now, I was designing models using Keras on my Ubuntu laptop. It's an old HP laptop, the 2014 version of the 15 inch pavilion series, P007tx. It has 8gb ram and the Nvidia GeForce GT 840m card. It has a lot of hardware issues so I'm looking to purchase a new laptop. I'll be utilizing the new laptop for running softwares like Matlab, reading research papers, making presentations and designing the deep learning models.

My dilemma is, should I use the laptop for training the models as well, in which case I'll have to buy a decent gaming laptop with a GTX 1080 card or should I buy a normal laptop, like the latest 15 inch MacBook pro, use it for model design and then use AWS instances or Google cloud computing services to train the models?

I am looking for a long term investment, I.e looking to use the laptop for next 4-5 years atleast. I read on an online forum that using gaming laptops for graphic intensive purposes like training Deep neural nets for long time may result in damage of the hardware inside them, hence I'm inclined to follow the second approach which I have suggested.

The budget is not an issue. But it has to be a laptop as I'm a university student and have to carry the laptop around for classes and all. Can't be a desktop. 

Please give suggestions as soon as possible. ",7,2,False,self,,,,,

This confuses me because that means that half of the rewards will be greater than zero, and the other less than zero. Now, lets assume this array of rewards came from an episode that we liked (good performance) then we'd want to reinforce the behavior. But as far as I can tell half of the actions will be associated with positive reward (and thus encouraged) and the other half with negative reward (and thus discourage). 


*Can anyone help me get a better intuition about why he does this? An example by Pytorch follows:*


PyTorch has in [their demo](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/reinforce.py) a solution of solving the [cart pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) from open ai gym, and the solution does the same thing in terms of modifying the rewards:

First we have the raw rewards (all ones. The longer the pole stays balanced, the more reward we get):

    [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,
      1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,
      1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]

Then we [discount](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/reinforce.py#L62) them:

    [26.76966303456023, 26.02996266117195, 25.282790566840355, 24.528071279636723, 23.76572856528962,

Then finally we apply the [mean of 0 and std of 1](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/reinforce.py#L65):

     [1.6023, 1.5001, 1.3965, 1.2929, 1.1897,

    -1.1172, -1.2289, -1.3396, -1.4498, -1.5600, -1.6695]

To be clear, I've seen [this post](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/) where we learn about data pre-processing and the value of updating mean and std of INPUT, but that is on the INPUT DATA, not the REWARDS. My question is why we would apply this transformation to the REWARDS.

This post is motivated by I conversation I had with an ecologist trying to working with events in systems which occur in a sequence, i.e. the events are related by time. 

Let me give two abstract examples, ""thought experiments"":

(1) Let's say you didn't know how to play chess. However, I am able to give you thousands of images of chess boards in mid-play; that is, for several years, I've been politely interrupting thousands of games of chess and taking pictures of a chess board from time start to time finish. I give them to you, but they are not labeled as to when during the game I took the picture. 

Question: could you infer (or statistically characterize) the rules of chess? That is, how could you characterize with confidence how the pieces move, the sequence of how the pieces are played, etc.?

What methods could one use to at least describe the rules of the game?

(2) Let's say there's a 1000 by 1000 matrix of pixel values, all black. Based on a color order rule that I know but you don't know, I switch a small subset of the pixels to either blue, red, green, yellow or purple. Once a pixel is switched from black to a non-black color, it cannot be switched again. (As an example, the rule is turn a few black pixels to red, then a few black pixels to green, then blue, then purple, then yellow. The rule is red-green-blue-purple-yellow.) I do this hundreds of thousands of times, each time starting with a new set of all black pixels, and saving the matrix at some point before I'm done. I send you each of these matrices.

From these thousands of matrices, how could you possibly infer the sequence of colors? Could you also infer something about where I've decided to place the colored pixels (i.e. is it entirely random or could there be a logic to where I'm placing these pixels)?",6,1,False,self,,,,,

By the end of the project, we plan to perform the inference on something like the Nvidia Jetson onboard the drone: where the challenge would be something like, say, landing the drone on a moving vehicle etc: which implies the tracking needs to be fairly accurate and also fast enough such that it runs at ~30fps on an embedded platform like the Jetson. The ones I have come across so far are algorithms like Faster RCNN, SSD, YOLO etc. As part of my research about existing techniques, I was hoping to get some feedback from the community here about some popular algorithms right now that focus on fast object detection and tracking.

However, I am still unsure how to go forward with the initial problem that I had in mind when I started the course.

Basically, what I am trying to do is implement an algorithm that will classify objects based on similarities of objects given multiple images without a supervised training set (i.e. an unsupervised training). For example, let's say I give the algorithm a bunch of images of cars on road (e.g. https://img3.stockfresh.com/files/p/paha_l/m/88/647080_stock-photo-many-cars-on-road.jpg), it should come up with a few classes such as Class 1 (cars), Class 2 (road), Class 3 (road marking), Class 4 (road sign), Class 5 (street light), Class 6 (Other). Obviously, it wouldn't know Class 1 is called a car because we never trained the object ""car"" explicitly. But the user can infer Class 1 is for cars based on what is highlighted after the algorithm has been completed.

I am not sure if what I'm asking for is impossible or if I should learn more such as Deep Learning in order to get this to work. Or is my only option to basically train each object (car, road, marking, etc.) separately based on images off Google?

I appreciate your inputs!

I did some processing on this output with no change in the dimension so it still 43264.

As you can notice in the structure of alexnet, the input of the pooling3 should 13x13x256. So I changed the feature vector 43264 to 13x13x256 matrix, to be a cell array 14000x1 each cell has 13x13x256.

I used the following code to train the network:

net = trainNetwork (Data, Datalabels, Layers, trainingOptions)

I still has an error saying unexpected input to Pooling layer!

I am working through the DeepLearning course of Prof. Hinton at Coursera. Unluckily - or luckily? (depends) - he isn't that easy to follow. Fortunately for me I did the DeepLearning Coursera course with Prof. Ng. And he is very easy to follow and explains everything in great detail.

Now I have to get an understanding of how the backprop in a RNN works if you want to implement it from scratch (I know there are libraries). But I want to understand it so I have to at least implement it on a small scale.

I worked myself through a simple two step RNN using Prof Ng graph method and working backwards. 

I searched my way through Google and Youtube, found some interesting stuff. But nothing that good. 

Which tutorials on BPTT - video or text - can you recommend?

Obviously not low hanging fruit, and possibly out of my skill level - will be hitting this hard over the weekend due to a local hackathon with a non trivial prize (startup deal from local council).

Some strategic steering on this topic would be really appreciated. 

I'll admit the links below are result of googling (light reading and discarding non useful results) rather than deep research on this topic. My previous work has been classifying images and building models on numerical input data. Sound analysis is a new area for me. So um.. yeah, hoping for pointers on fundamental methods for proof of concept and pathway to best practice.

YOLO allows you to detect multiple bounding boxes per image segment using anchor boxes.

My question is: the YOLO config contains an array of anchor values, specifically:

```anchors = [0.57273, 0.677385, 1.87446, 2.06253, 3.33843, 5.47434, 7.88282, 3.52778, 9.77052, 9.16828]```

How do I make use of these anchor values? How can I organize custom training data into a format where each image segment has, for example, 5 anchor boxes? How do I know which specific anchor box to put a label into?

PS: I've tried researching this topic for a few days now and I've come up blank.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

The data I have is not natural images. Mine are very special images taken in a lab using some fancy optical instruments. My understanding is that various pre-trained models in Model Zoo of Caffe won't be of help to me. Correct me if I am wrong here.

Which is the easiest and the quickest DL framework I should try out to determine whether it will be useful for classification given my dataset? Caffe? Tensorflow? Keras? 

I only want to do a proof of concept exercise to show whether DL is feasible for my tasks. Don't need to create novel DL architectures at this point in time.
