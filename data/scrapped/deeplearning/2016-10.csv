At receiving station this data is decompressed and denoised. This can work for online video streaming,drive storage etc. The aim is that like Deep Mind, this system should work for all kind of data. But let's say we start with images. Also how will the system know for a new data that what is a noise in it? Humans can easily distinguish noise.
The problem is, autoencoder is good for denoising but not good for data compression. So can we design a hybrod system. And most importantly, how to implement this?",1,1,False,self,,,,,
