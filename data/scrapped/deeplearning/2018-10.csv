I have been studying ML/DL for some time and am now working on a project to learn. 

I am trying to detect boxes in the images. I first tested with a pre-trained model from Tensorflow Model API. 

I noticed that it does poorly on detecting colorful boxes. It also detects them in groups if it ever do.

I want to build a detector that can detect and locate individual boxes, and also all kind of boxes not just brown packaging boxes. What do you suggest I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if I need to get more data. I don't think it's feasible to get hundreds of training images for each type of boxes to be able to detect them all. I also don't need it to recognize what kind of box it is, although maybe it will be helpful.  

Should I re-annotate the images with new sets of labels and bounding boxes? Maybe many of the training images had grouped the boxes.

&amp;#x200B;

For starter, I do have a set of dozen type/brand boxes I'll like to detect. Should I create a database just for these boxes to start, and treat each brand logo box as a new class? But then, I would need to add training images and retrain with a new class every time i'll like to detect different item, right? How many images per class do I need to build a robust detector?

Please advise. Thank you in advance!

There is a deep model for prediction.

The outputs are some numbers between 0 and 80. (In the dataset the outputs are 0-80)

I built a model and its Loss value equals to 70 and I would like to reduce it.

I printed the outputs after evaluating the model by test values and some of the predicted values are more than 80 or less than 0.

I decided to set up the final layer to predict just in 0-80 in training step, therefore I set a lambda layer after final Dense layer to clip output values.

The codes:

    def relu_advanced(x):
    return K.relu(x, max_value=80)

    def createModel4():
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(256,(3, 3),
                     activation='relu',
                     input_shape=(320,20,1), padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))

    model.add(Flatten())
    #model.add(Dense(5*320, activation= 'relu'))
    model.add(Dense(5*320))
    model.add(Lambda(relu_advanced))
    
    
    
    model.summary()
    return model

I tested the model with and without the relu_advanced and unfortunately the Loss value is increased!

I don't know what may happend that the Loss is increased while there is no value much than 80 or less than zero?

I'd  like to implement a partially connected neural network with  \~3-4  hidden layers (a sparse deep neural network?) where I can specify which  node connects to which node from the previous/next layer. So I want the  architecture to be

highly  specified/customized from the get go and I want the neural network to  optimize the weights of the specified connections, while keeping  everything else 0 during the forward pass and the back-propagation  (connection does not exist). I am a complete beginner in neural  networks. I have been recently working with tensorflow &amp;  tensorflow-keras to construct fully connected deep networks. Is there  anything in tensorflow that I should look into that might allow me to do  this? I think I should be able to specify the computational graph such  that only certain connections exist but I really have no idea yet where  to start from to do this...

While  doing some online research, I came across papers/posts on network  pruning, but it doesn't seem really relevant to me. I don't want to go  back and prune my network to make it less over-parameterized or  eliminate insignificant connections. I want the connections to be  specified and the network to be relatively sparse from the  initialization and stay that way during the back-propagation.

My thought is that buying a pre-built workstation / server, will be way more expensive than building one myself, but the benefits of having a setup that is tried and tested, not having to spend weeks getting it up and running, and the possibility of having access to good support, highly out-weights the cost-difference. Allowing me to focus on my resource in stead. I'm wondering though if I'm being to pessimistic here.  Any thoughts on this?

GPU server cost

Database server cost

Electricity cost

Warehouse cost

Backup power cost

Hardware Maintenance cost

Operational Monitoring cost per person

Internet bandwidth cost

how should I calculate the CPU cycles burnt for each individual scan, what tools can help with it?

Ive just started working through Goodfellows brilliant book [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and thought it would be very useful to start a study group to discuss bits which are difficult to understand and also to keep us motivated!

Heres what I have in mind:

* Each week we work through a small section of the book and post questions we have on the relevant thread on blackswans.io for the rest of the group to answer.
* Each fortnight we set an optional programming challenge, e.g., create an RNN for stock price prediction using TensorFlow, and compare our code.

Id like to finish the first section *Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics* by Christmas, which translates to about 15 pages per week.

&amp;#x200B;

First post on this thread (and reddit even). Just started studying ML and DL at the beginning of this summer in France, and couldn't help but decide an English-French language translator would be a good first project. 

I found a dataset of 2m sentences and tried using RNNs but they turned out to be really slow, and have since been surprised that so much of the literature for seq2seq concerns them. Reading further into the issue it seems there are better and faster models available such as using CNNs or just using attention mechanisms.

The Transformer is the model I found and implemented, and it reduced training time from a month to about three/four days. I thought this was phenomenal, to have gained such understanding of two languages and their relationship with each other in such a short time.

I've written up the results and my learning experience during my first project and wanted to share it. Hope it's of interest to any of you out there! Would love to hear too if anyone has suggestions for how to improve or thoughts on RNNs vs other current models in seq2seq.

I designed a CNN model and trained it on a given task of own. As the performances stucked, I wanted to look at the layers weights with tensorboard to see how they evolve, if I need more regularization etc. However the model seems to effectively learn something, the layer weights have always the same distribution over the training. My first idea was that those layers could be flushed, but the model performances decreased.

Here is how it looks like for the second layer

&amp;#x200B;

[second layer weights \(bias and kernel\) evolution during learning](https://i.redd.it/jpvhoidmijs11.png)

It is even worst (to my mind) for the last layer where all weight seem to converge to 0

&amp;#x200B;

[last layer weights \(bias and kernel\) evolution during learning](https://i.redd.it/va4w3s7tijs11.png)

As you can see, the bias distributions evolves during learning, but not the weights one, so I am afraid that the model only learns the bias.

You should definitely check out [Labelbox](http://labelbox.com/). They are based out of San Francisco and are funded by Google, Kleiner Perkins, and First Round. They have set out to build the most advanced data labeling tool in the world. Here are some key features:

**Customizable Labeling Interfaces**

Quickly setup segmentation (vector or pixel-wise) and classification labeling tasks using the GUI builder.

https://i.redd.it/2gaedsa8lls11.gif

**Tiled Imagery Support (Maps)**

Imagery from drones and satellites are often processed to form a mosaic of an area using techniques like photogrammetry. Use Labelbox to create bounding boxes and polygons directly on the tiled imagery (zoomable maps). Ideal for drone maps, satellite imagery and even medical data.

**Advanced Labeling Tools**

Labelbox supports Polygon, Rectangle, Line, and Point segmentation. Theres also support for pixel-wise annotation with the Superpixel and Brush tools. This allows you to have super precision and speed when annotating complicates shapes like clouds and trees for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ztjd0yeclls11.gif

**Concurrent Labeling Queue**

Instantly scale your labeling team to any size and Labelbox will serve up images to be labeled asynchronously. No two labelers will label the same data.

**Private and Secure Data**

Labelbox works with source data hosted on-premise or on a private cloud. The source data is accessed directly from the client computer and never shared (or accessible) by Labelbox. Check out the guide [here](https://support.labelbox.com/docs/private-on-premise).

**Collaboration**

Whether you have an in-house team of experts or are using a managed workforce to label data, you can bring all of this in one place with flexible collaboration and management tools.

The collaborators feature allows you to invite Individuals or Teams to help with a labeling project. If multiple users are collaborating on a labeling project, Labelbox distributes all of the data attached to a project to the collaborators with access. Labelbox also gives you the option to automatically measure the *consensus/agreement* on labels.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/o49919bglls11.gif

**Quality Assurance**

You can configure Labelbox to have more than one labeler label the same image in order to compare the quality of work and identify hard to label images or a labeler thats not following directions. This tool is called Consensus and it works by having more than one labeler (human or machine) label the same asset (image, text string, video, etc...). Once an asset has been labeled more than once, the results can be compared quantitatively (by using an equation) and a *consensus* score is calculated automatically. Auto Consensus works in real time so you can take immediate and corrective actions towards improving your training data and model performance.

Alternatively, Labelbox has a review tool so that you or your team can review every label and score them, or even put them back in the queue to be re-labeled.

**Fully Featured API**

Labelbox is an API first product. You can build and operate fully automated human in the loop machine learning pipelines. Click [here](https://support.labelbox.com/docs/labeling-api-js-reference) to read through the API docs.

**Measure Performance**

Maintain the highest quality standards for your data by keeping track of labeling task performance of individuals and teams.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7zob7xrjlls11.png

**Export Your Labels**

You can export in popular formats such as JSON, CSV, Pascal VOC, COCO, and TFRecord format. You can also use the API to automatically pipe your labeled data into your ML training environment.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm training a ConvNet using Keras and Theano, but before doing that I decided to take a peek into the dataset, its data samples and classes... And I don't like what I'm seeing.

I'm using the following code to load both training and test datasets and count how many data samples are labeled for each one:

    import numpy as np 
    from keras.datasets import mnist  
    
    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()  
    
    train_classes = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 
    test_classes = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 
    
    for i in y_train:
         train_classes[y_train[i]] = train_classes[y_train[i]] + 1
    for i in y_test:
         test_classes[y_test[i]] = test_classes[y_test[i]] + 1 
    
    print('Training classes: ', train_classes) 
    print('\nTesting classes: ', test_classes)

... And the results are worrying:

    (ann) C:\Users\shado\mnist&gt;python statistics.py 
    Using Theano backend. 
    Training classes: [6742, 17900, 5421, 6265, 11907, 5923, 0, 0, 0, 5842] 
    Testing classes: [1010, 1924, 1135, 0, 1940, 974, 0, 980, 0, 2037]

So as you can see from the label counts, the training dataset is missing the '6', '7' and '8' classes, while the testing dataset is missing the '3', '6' and '8' classes. And of course, the class distribution is all over the place, specially on the training dataset.

I have a dataset of short texts in Korean close to personal writings in style and I'm looking to find a good way of representing them to measure similarity.  I am considering experimenting with a few different methods, starting from TF-IDF, LSA, LDA, through word vector-based ones, like doc2vec and some ways to compose word vectors (p-mean, WMD, weighted average).  

I wonder if using subword-level RNN's hidden states as text representations would have an advantage over these methods in capturing semantic similarity, since they seem to perform well on classification tasks. 

I'm willing to experiment with this anyway, but can't quite estimate how big of a dataset I'd need to train it in an unsupervised way like an autoencoder to get reasonable results and if it is worth the effort at all. Since the data is in Korean, I can't just use state-of-the-art models like BERT or ELMo.

I would greatly appreciate if someone shared experience dealing with a similar problem or links to papers or blogs I might have missed.

Thanks!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Initially, no matter what the hyperparameters were, the outputs that were getting produced were all 0.5, thus indicating vanishing gradient problem (1/(1+exp(0))) = 0.5 

So, I standardized all the data inputs, changed it to tanh functions, applied batch normalization for all the hidden layers, including the output layer, and it does seem to produce some sensible outputs, 

But then now, it's giving the same outputs regardless of the inputs I feed in. I've implemented batch normalization such that given the next layer's neurons' values, you would standardize them, then multiply each with its own trainable constant (scaling parameter), and then shift it by another its own trainable constant (shifting parameter)

&amp;#x200B;

I think the problem comes from the shifting parameter ""taking over"" and the network just updating those shifting parameters, thereby decreasing the error overall, but not changing the network's weights, thus even when given different inputs, still produces the same outputs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could that be the reason? What would be the work around that? I tried just standardizing the batch's neurons without applying scaling and shifting parameters, but it still causes vanishing gradient problem, that is, the outputs given are always 0.5 for sigmoid functions

In some papers, whose data are time series, a model which combined the CNN and LSTM is used. Somewhere it is named as CNN-Lstm network.

The first question is that how such combined model will improve the final predictions of the model? what are the functions of CNN and the followed LSTM in these models? How is it working?

I would like to use such a model for my time series data. My input is 320*20*1 matrix and the output is 1600 matrix. 

At first, I used the CNN model for predicting and the loss value is approximately high. I decided to improve it by using CNN-LSTM model. 

I tried to build a CNN-LSTM model for my data. In the LSTM models, the input shape is (number of examples, TimeSteps, FeaturesPerStep). 

When I use the LSTM layers after the CNN layers, it needs to a reshape layer for preparing to import to LSTM layers.

While the input and output contain one time_step data, So I reshaped to (1,1600) which 1600 is as size as the output! 

Is it correct? Can I increase the timestep value?

My Loss didn't decrease in CNN-LSTM model, is the mistake in my model?

I append the LSTM at the end of CNN, as below:

    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(256,(3, 3),
                     input_shape=(320,20,1), padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(LeakyReLU())

    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(LeakyReLU())

    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    model.add(LeakyReLU())

    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(1600))
    
    model.add(Reshape((1,1600)))
    
    model.add(LSTM(400, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(LSTM(400))
    
    model.add(Activation(activation='tanh'))

If you used this technology to automate scam calling, and used deep learning to study, psychological vulnerabilities, and then to evaluate and integrate it's data to which vulnerabilities &amp; methodw are most effective, wouldn't this be certainly catastrophic?

I need your advice/feedback. As a ML/AL engineer I quite often struggle to find new and relevant datasets for my tasks.

I am thinking of creating a simple website + storage to help solve those problems with the power of crowdsourcing. It should be non-profit I think.
So, I created a simple website with limited capabilities just to show off the idea. What you think of this? I know that there's a Google Dataset Search, but it's not really what I need. Would you like to participate I this kind of project on a github/contibute? Or maybe you think idea is useless?

I used to use Fedora for backend development, when I started to learn deep learning I saw that everybody uses Ubuntu. 

But Fedora is enough good for DL too? I am not sure about that if I install the Nvidia Cuda tools, those will be fully compatible with Fedora or Ubuntu better?  


Because Fedora always changes the Linux Kernel and if I am right the NV Cuda tools build for a specific linux kernel.

Here what I see: [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target\_os=Linux&amp;target\_arch=x86\_64&amp;target\_distro=Fedora&amp;target\_version=27](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&amp;target_arch=x86_64&amp;target_distro=Fedora&amp;target_version=27) \- Cuda tools support only Fedora 27.
