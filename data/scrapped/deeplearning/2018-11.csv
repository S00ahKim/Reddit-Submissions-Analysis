malmo project provides some interface to control the actor in minecraft and get some feedback

tensorforce project provides Reinforcement learning api based on tensorflow

so my goal is to use tensorforce to play minecraft via malmo

------
In my opinion:
in tensorforce,I need to pass state to the agent ,and get the action from agent

        action = agent.act(state)
        state, terminal, reward = environment.execute(action)

then pass action to malmo (parse to `command`) and get the state (maybe `world_state.observations`)

        agent_host.sendCommand(command)
        world_state = agent_host.getWorldState()
        obvsText = world_state.observations[-1].text

Often considered one of the most successful and widespread application of machine learning technologies in business, they have been employed by major companies like Netflix, Amazon or Google to create new revenue streams and provide tailored experiences. Fortunately, their benefits are not limited to major tech companies with deep pockets. With a minimal technical background, almost anyone can implement a simple recommender system.

The objective of this webinar, hosted by Bigstep's Data Scientist, Andras Palfi, is to demystify the algorithms and methods used by recommender systems and provide a few practical use cases. No previous technical background is necessary, but familiarity with high-school level programming and mathematics will be helpful.

You must always believe that your capable of doing anything you want in your life, it's just all about taking a decision, having a willpower, and taking the right steps and guidance

Becoming overweight or obese is a cumulative result of having positive energy balance for a certain peroid of time, to reverse your condition and get a healthy weight, you should get a certain negative energy balance scheduled over a certain peroid...

To accomplish such thing, you should always start with changing your lifestyle; like:

\- Diet (eating low energy density food, drinking more water, using certain meal replacementsetc.)

\- Physical Activity (doing more housework or even engaging in some sports in a certain schedule...etc.)

\- Change your behaviors

Later on, in certain situations, you could use some medications which are very effective combined with lifestyle changes (some are even found as Over The Counter medications), and lastly surgeries can be done...

You should always know that being in good general condition doesn't, in anyhow, being safe from more than 195 complication of obesity!! So you must lose that excess fat!

Moreover, studies shows that being overweight is carrying some serious medical consequences...

This was a brief nutshell, for the sake of increasing your awareness of how important to lose your excess fat, and how some tips are used to do so...

I've already made few lectures available for preview, you can also take a more detailed idea about some facts &amp; myths about obesity, which way to start losing weight, what food to eat, how much to exercise &amp; much other in the provided course...

In a dataset, the data are the average of vehicles speed in the points (cells) of a map. I am trying to build a prediction model. 

While the inputs are the average of vehicles speed of all points in recent 40 min and the outputs are the next 10 min of all points.

If there were 320 points on the map, the input shape = (320,20) and the output shape =(320,5). The averages of vehicles speed are collected each 2 min in all points.

There are several such samples (n samples, x=(n,320,20), y=(n,320,5)).

I thought that it is a time series problem. So, after the transposing the input and output, I used the LSTM network.

I recently started a new project to investigate the business use cases and commercial viability of neural networks on structured and semi-structured data. The scope is exploring how deep learning can be applied to raw bank transactions.

The two hypothesis which I would like to validate are based around automating feature engineering:

* Unsupervised learning algorithms like word2vec and autoencoding can be used to generate embedding vectors representing customer attributes/features. These vectors capture latent information in a lower dimensional space which can then be used for modelling

* RNNs/LSTMs can be used on raw transactions (sequential data) to train predictive models that are as good as GBMs, but significantly faster to build because features don't need to be handcrafted and no domain specific knowledge is needed

Are there any other areas that you would recommend for me to look into for my investigation into how neural networks can be applied to raw bank transaction data?

The authors of our weekly paper propose a method to produce texture maps for 3D morphable models of the face from images of faces in the wild. They introduce an extension of the spatial transformer network block. The new block interprets and normalizes 3D poses and self-occlusion. The rotation, translation, face model parameters in this block are learned unsupervised while training for simple geometric objectives.  
As an example, we show the texture maps produced by the network when images of Elon Musk are fed into it.

So what i was thinking initially is to transform the images in the code where I also resize the images to fit the input for AlexNet.

This is what i have so far:

function I = readFunctionTrain(filename)

% Resize the input image named ""filename"" such that the output

% image (I) has a dimension of 227x227x3

I = imread(filename);

I = imresize(I, \[227 227\]); %Simple resize function for resizing to 277x277

If = flipdim(I,2); %flips image to the right

Ik = imrotate(I,35,'bilinear','crop'); %rotates image 35 degree

It = imtranslate(I,\[15, 25\]); %translates image by 15 and 25 pixels in X and Y direction

Ih = histeq(I); %normalizez histogram

&amp;#x200B;

end

I am starting (few months) studying about AI and now I am at the point where I am studying about reinforcement learning.

I am using Berkeley pacman framework to do that. At this point, I achieved coding an approximate Q learning agent using homemade features.

Now, I would like to continue my work toward ultimately coding a deep Q learning with CNN and so on. But it seems the gap is still huge between where I am now and a full DQN.

I would have liked to take baby steps and see for myself what the problems are step by step (e.g. Divergence,...) before jumping right into a complete solution that works but where I would not have understood the steps to get there.

So now, given that I have an approximate Q learning agent with home made features that works, I would have thought the next step would be coding an approximate agent that approximates the Q values with a fully connected network (no CNN) where the features (the inputs) are the pixels (so in Berkeley implementation, the information given by the state variable) and the outputs are the Q values for each action.

Hi,

I am training a Siamese network using a variant of AlexNet (I added some inception like features like Depth concatenation instead of having a plain coarse 11x11 conv layer to boot)

Hardware: K80 GPU on Amazon AWS

Agenda is to do face identification.

Dataset: Facescrub dataset duly requested and collected from the original Authors. Using only 1/2 of the dataset due to space constraint.

Augmentation: Eye detection and Face alignment, Zoom in, Zoom out, Gaussian Noise, Rotation clock and anti-clock and random combination of these

Training always starts with 50% of the samples coming from aug set(at least one of the images of the siamese triplet was from aug set)

L2 Loss is also added (L2 Loss starts with 15% of the total loss at start of training)

My layer arch looks like this:  
*NOTE: (conv layer ==&gt; relu, maxpool 3x3 and strided by 2x2 )*  
c1a - (3x3) conv layer on grayscale input  
LRN - (Local response normalization)  
c1b - (5x5) conv layer on grayscale input  
LRN - (Local response normalization)  
c1 - Depth concat of c1a and c1b  
c2 - 5x5 conv layer on c1  
c3 - 3x3 conv on c2 but no maxpool  
c4 - 3x3 conv on c3 but no maxpool  
c5 - 3x3 conv layer on c4  
Flatten C5  
Dropout at 50%  
Dense Layer with Sigmoid  
Drop out at 50%  
Dense Layer with Sigmoid to produce Facial Embedding

My problem is that even after 16,000 batches, the loss has come down only from 3.5 to 1.3. It has been running for more than 24 hours now.

**Should I continue this training or abort it?**

If you look at the Gradients below, the layers C1A, C1B and the likes have the best gradients (max of all gradients in the layer as well as mean values)  
And the layers closer to the output have lesser gradients  
It sounds counter-intuitive to me.

I thought the ones closer to the output will have the best gradients and the ones further down will worsen But what I observe is counter-intuitive. What do you guys think?

I use Adam Optimizer. The gradients below are calculated using the computeGradients API call.

I'm looking to use a deep learning model like Faster CNN to classify small objects in images. I understand Faster CNN should be better for small, closely spaced objects than SSD and YOLO.

Regardless of model choice I'm trying to understand if I can use a human operator to inspect my model's validation and test results and correct my model or relabel my train/test images. 

The reason I want to do this is that I have a large series of images that I have been able to annotate with some simple computer vision algorithms. I am trying to explore feasibility of applying deep learning to this data set instead, and would ideally like to train my CNN with this image data that was already annotated by OpenCV algorithms. The algorithm has decent performance of detecting my objects but is not particularly strong in sensitivity or precision. I'm interested to see if a CNN can improve performance and extend to future cases better (different resolution, lighting, cameras, etc).

My questions  
Are there any guides for training a CNN, inspecting and correcting some results, and then retraining the model? 

Is this a worthwhile endeavor? 

I feel like this has the possibility to save a lot of hours of work, but I'm wondering whether this is a sensible approach or not.

I'm wondering if any tutorials for this exist. I imagine that I'm looking for a GUI in Python to present predictions on some images, and some ability for the human operator to give inputs about whether model was right, or whether model missed some detections.

Let's say you want your newly recorded song to sound like your favorite band or artist that is of a similar genre. Normally the mixing engineer (the one who does the mixing work) listens to this reference track and tries to make it sound similar to the reference track. 

**My question is:**

Do you think it would be possible to do this (almost) instantly with the use of AI? 

So, a neural network listens to the song of choice and uses that information to shape the newly recorded song in a similar way. Basically what a mixing engineer would normally do. 

I am almost sure that complete replacement of the mixing engineer is not possible, since there is a lot of nuance going on in each mixing process due to the wide variety of elements that go into a mix (types of instruments, musician skill, instrument tones, instrument qualities, recording equipment and methods, mixing equipment and methods etc.).

I'm trying to implement it myself so I can understand it more. I ended up deriving the gradients myself.

So my understanding is that if t = T is the terminal time index, and suppose you have forward passed GRU,

and   using the equations and notations above, you would find the gradient  of  error wrt h\_(T), then via chain rule, you can find dL/d(z\_(T)) and   dL/d(r\_(T)) .....etc and update the weights matrices and biases.

And   if it's a multi-layered GRU, then I would also find dL/d(x\_(T)) and   that would be the ""gradient of error wrt h\_(T)"" for the previous layer's   GRU unit.

My  question is that after  you update those matrices for t = T, then you  move on to t = T-1 and do  the same thing until t = 0 right? What about  h\_(T-1) ? when I'm  calculating the gradients for the GRU unit for t = T,  do I also have to  calculate the gradient wrt h\_(T-1) ? What do I do  with them then?

Also,   for given t, and given GRU unit, and given the gradients for the   weights, how many times am I supposed to update the weights matrix? only   once and then move on to T-1? if so, wouldn't that make it impossible   to use stuff like adaptive learning rate method? which requires   information about the previous gradient?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

Hey Guys 

I am doing a little project for university about deep learning, this includes a theoretical part. 

I am sitting here for a couple of hours (and days to be honest) trying to understand what weights, biases and the pooling layer in a DCNN are. 

So this is what I understood so far:

Weights and Bias

Weights are a binary number that are determined by a neuronal network and basically says how important the output of a neuron is for the calculation of the next neuron. So the importance of a output. 

The Bias is also a number determined by the NN and is basically a threshold that determines if the incoming output of the previous neuron is ""important/high"" enough to activate the neuron. 

The actual output of the activation function of a neuron, the weight and bias are processed by the sigmoid function and gives a value that is given to the next neuron.

The determination of weights and biases in a NN is optimized through gradient descent (or was it back propagation?). 


Pooling and Kernels 


The Kernels in a DCNN ""scan"" the whole picture small area by small area and then gives it to the Pooling Neurons. The pooling Neurons then proceed to check the scanned small areas for features that determine what kind of picture was fed to the DCNN. What I dont understand is why there are multiple pooling layers and what the pooling layers send to the Neurons in the hidden layers. 

Sorry if my understanding is laughable and my questions are dumb, but I just cant wrap my head around this. 

Every help is appreciated!
