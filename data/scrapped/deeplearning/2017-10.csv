So I built a 4 layered network in Tensorflow, and I tried everything, and I mean everything. I built so many weird cost functions with reversed datasets and weird ideas but I just can't get it to output ones or zeroes. The target of the dataset I train it with is mostly 0s with about 0.36% being 1s. So the network just outputs really really small outputs from 0 - 0.0001 and calls it a day because the cost becomes around 0.036.

I tried feeding in the inputs reverses comparing it to the regular target and maximize this cost, I tried comparing the outputs of random inputs with the inputs from the dataset and maximizing the difference between them, all kinds of stuff and I was never able to really get it to work.

I tried using Relu, up to 8 layers with up to 100 hidden units per layer.
I tried training with a MomentumOptimizer and an AdamOptimizer with a variety of decaying or stable learning rates and momentums.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated, I'm here to learn.

P.S: I also tried seperating only the positive examples and pairing it with the same amount of negative examples but it just started outputting 0.5

Also the output layer has sigmoid activation",14,3

If you run this, the loss decreases and validation_loss just goes up and up.

Is it in fact possible to approximate the determinant using keras? That is, is deep learning powerful enough to do this?",5,2

A colleague of mine and myself are attempting to set up seq2seq translation char based(EN-&gt;DE) but are having trouble finding clean data. Innitially we used the data from the [wmt conference](http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/) but quickly noticed that they were not sanatised (ie. line 10 in the german file corresponds to line 12 on the english file).  The [stanford data](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/) is sanatised to tokenize word-based (added a space infront of every '.')

My code is written in Keras using Theano as backend, and it's based on [the examples from the Machine Learning Mastery website](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/).

Using a ConvNet as a starting point I want to build several smaller ConvNets, each one capable of classifying a subset of classes (for example, five ConvNets capable of classifying a pair of digits each). I have a trained model and tensors array, but I can't find a way to easily build the smaller ones.

I initially thought about keeping just a subset of outputs from the tensors array on the original network (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44899850/changing-a-trained-network-to-keep-only-a-subset-of-its-output) entry on Stackoverflow) but Keras keeps throwing errors when I try to do it.

My plan B is to try again with Lambda layers as discussed [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/890). I need to read a lot about this method, but AFAIK I should need one Lambda layer per output, and then merge them in pairs...

This is the code I use for training and saving my model:

    import numpy
    from keras.datasets import mnist
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.models import load_model
    from keras.layers import Dense
    from keras.layers import Dropout
    from keras.layers import Flatten
    from keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D
    from keras.layers.convolutional import MaxPooling2D
    from keras.utils import np_utils
    from keras import backend as K
    K.set_image_dim_ordering('th')
    
    seed = 7
    numpy.random.seed(seed)
    
    # Data load
    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

    # Image format
    X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 1, 28, 28).astype('float32')
    X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 1, 28, 28).astype('float32')
    
    # normalize inputs
    X_train = X_train / 255
    X_test = X_test / 255
    y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train)
    y_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test)
    num_classes = y_test.shape[1]
    
    def baseline_model():
    	# Model design
        model = Sequential()

        # Convolutional Layer
        model.add(Conv2D(32, (5, 5), input_shape=(1, 28, 28), activation='relu'))
    
        # Pooling Layer
        model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    
        # Dropout Layer
        model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    
        # Flatten Layer
        model.add(Flatten())
    
        # Fully Connected Layer
        model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    
        # Output Layer
    	model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
    
    	# Model Compilation
    	model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    	return model
    
    # Model Construction
    model = baseline_model()

    # Model Training
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=10, batch_size=200, verbose=2)

    # Model Testing
    scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
    print(""Baseline Error: %.2f%%"" % (100-scores[1]*100))
    
    # Model Saving
    model.save(""convnet_simple_model.h5"")

    # Tensors Saving
    model.save_weights(""convnet_simple_tensors.h5"")
    print(""Model saved."")

    # Model Clearing
    del model 

And this is the code I'm trying to use for slicing the outputs of the pretrained model above:
    
    import numpy
    from keras.datasets import mnist
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.models import load_model
    from keras.layers import Dense
    from keras.layers import Dropout

    from keras.layers.convolutional import MaxPooling2D
    from keras.utils import np_utils
    from keras import backend as K
    K.set_image_dim_ordering('th')
    
    # Loading saved model
    model = load_model('convnet_simple_model.h5')

    # Loading saved tensors
    model.load_weights(""convnet_simple_tensors.h5"")
    
    # Selecting outputs to be sliced
    outputs = [0, 1, 2]

    # Slicing outputs
    # [NOT WORKING!]   
    weights = model.layers[5].get_weights()
    
    # This is the line that throws the error    
    transpose = K.transpose(weights)

    gather = K.gather(transpose, outputs)
    new_W = K.transpose(gather)
    print(new_W)
    
    ### TODO: Save Tensors Array as file.

On this final piece of code, I get the following error when compiling:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
       File ""convnet_load_trained.py"", line 25, in &lt;module&gt;

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever tried to train their models via external GPU on their MacBook before? I've done some research and looked at few external GPU's (BISON) and they've peaked my interest.

My issue is that my AWS server costs are becoming somewhat high (I'm probably doing something silly while running my epochs) and I would much rather invest into something that I can have for the long run and use for other things (gaming, maybe even mining? Correct me if I'm over my head here).

Just wondering if anyone has ever tried to use an external GPU from BISON or other companies? And if something like this is even possible in the mac world. 

If all else fails, I'll invest some money into a more intricate computer, but I really just need a GPU with CUDDA 

Thanks again

Imagine I have a binary classification task for which I want to use some DNN. It could be recognizing if a picture is a cat or a dog, or if a MNIST digit is even or odd.

What are the best practices when it comes to encoding the output:

- should I use a one hot vector (e.g. cat=[0,1] and dog=[1,0])
- should I just use a single value (e.g. cat=0 and dog=1)

Is one approach better than the other, or is it totally irrelevant.

Tx in advance

The dataset I will be working with is the sales data of products on an E-commerce shop. The goal is to perform sales forecast. 

LSTM is the most mentioned model when it comes to deep learning time series forecast. However, I haven't found any paper suggesting that it performs well on other data sets rather than image recognition and translation. Instead, I found many people complaining about its performance and difficult tuning process. I am now worried that LSTM may never work for sales forecast.

So, my question is, according to your experience do you think LSTM performs well on real-life time series forecast in comparison with tranditional models like ARIMA and Holt-winters? ",4,9

I've recently began to take interest in neural networks (month or two). I've watched a couple of tutorials, and the udacity free deep learning course. I am completely confused about this field. 
There was some introductory class in machine learning on my college , but they didn't teach introductory stuff like training, testing, fitting and those concepts, they began with some linear algebra math that involved some four dimensional spaces and reducing them to two dimensions. It left me completely confused. I was always good at math but not that abstract area. 
Watching online videos I made MNIST classifier and notMNIST (udacity thing), I have good (or I think so) understanding of math involved there: matrices multiplying, softmax probabilities, one hot encoding, cross entropy error, taking derivatives with respect to the weights and subtracting them. I also understood convolutions with strides, padding, filters etc. I really enjoyed getting from 0 understanding on this field, to being able to classify handwritten digits.
I need your opinions whether should I continue to spend time in deep learning if I posses math skills to understand derivatives and matrices multiplying and not abstract spaces. Would you recommend some materials that I should look through?

I am really grateful for your advice :)

So I have a pretty basic game I have here. I created a very simple neural network with 20 hidden layers 9 input layers and 1 out put. Which in the end allowed me to aim the ""cannon"" the green line which shoots. I had another network which would shoot if it was visible etc. etc. 

What do you guys think best way to have one network to make the blue thing move on its own. I am using dlib with cuda, the bit I am becoming stuck with is that how do I effectively teach it movement for example, I could say if you move closer it is good, however, it could just easily get stuck in a corner. So any advice would be appreciated. 
+ What sized network do you think would be best suited. ",1,3
