I hope my question is not misplaced. 
ImageNet is a useful resource for (academic) research and not for commercial purpose, as a consequence how to do something equivalent when we are a company: for each category in WordNet, search for images on Google, label them and feed our CNN with these images? Or does there exist another solution?

Let's say it would be text prediction. Each person has it's own style, but of course there are similarities between many of them.
LSTMs keep their internal state. So what I understand it would be reasonable to initialize that hidden state with the personal parameters of the single person that is speaking.
Does anybody know an example or a teaching article about problems like that?
When a new person enters, I do not know much about her, but some kind of group she belongs to. So she should inherit the default settings of her group but that parameter set should be adopted fast to her own style.
