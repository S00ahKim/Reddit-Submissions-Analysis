The model works pretty well using a similar Keras code above, though I want to implement the same using H20.ai

This [documentation here on H2O Deep Water](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/deep-learning.html) says ""The H2O Deep Water project supports CNNs and **RNNs** though third-party integrations of other deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Caffe and MXNet."". Though there are no demos for the same. 

In this conversation here in Jan '16 on ['Recurrent Neural Networks in H2O for time series prediction?'](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/h2ostream/qU2FezMCyW8), they say it hasn't been implemented yet.

I have video recordings of hundreds of games of [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/). [typical gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_LdRIWN_g).

I thought it would fun to see if, using only the video as input, I could build a DNN that would automatically tell me which player played which card, in order, throughout the game.

I realize that in many ways this is a straightforward object detection problem which doesn't require DL. The cards played by both players are clearly displayed (upper-left for the opponent, lower-right for the current player). But it *could* though... right? Also, there is a lot of other information embedded in the video: which creatures attacked other creatures, the specific damage done, which spells were played and their targets, etc.

[HSTracker](https://hsdecktracker.net) already does some of the above by injecting into the Hearthstone process and monitoring it from within. But again, I think it would be a fun way for me way to jump into DL.

Input: video file

Output: detailed gameplay information

I can easily obtain graphics of each card. Also, it would be fine to start with only a limited set of cards (e.g. the same deck played against each other).

So... where would you suggest I start? A CNN that takes in each frame of the video and predicts which card(s) are visible, etc.?

I thought I would ask the community for any ideas as some additional experience could help.

The inputs:

Y = A (relatively small) continuous variable.  EX: -15.000 to 15.000 but some outliers going much higher (~50).

X= *multiple properties referring to an object
*multiple properties referring to a replacement for that object
*multiple properties referring to nearby objects as well as their distance to the initial object/replacement.

There are ~65-70 features, no categoricals for the groups (but could be), properties can be the same if the objects are the same, and over 10k rows. 

With Keras (sequential/dense), the data is input all together. The 3 layers start large ( ~250 and fan down to ~100. Relu function, Adam or Nadam optimizer, uniform kernel initiation, 50 batch size and the lowest MSE (0.5-7) at 250-350 epochs. Only ~50% of the predicted Y are near the actual Y. 

It could potentially be getting caught in a minima, which I am not sure just yet how to fix exactly as I havent had a problem like this previously.  Would definitely be glad to hear any suggestions the community has.

I have just created a new course on Udemy called, ""Practical Deep Learning with Keras and Python"". This course tries to cover the gap left by many deep learning courses -- applying the models on non-toy examples. In my time as a university teacher teaching Machine Learning, I have repeatedly seen students come up to me and ask me why they are getting ""shape mismatch"" issues and how to prepare their data to feed to deep models. I have tried to cover the ""why"" of the concepts that starters struggle with (and not cover the whole deep learning curriculum for which there are already quite a few great courses.)

If you are new to deep learning and need a soft introduction, this might be a good place to start. If you have already taken a theory course and want to know how to use this amazing tool Keras, you only have to spend about 3 hours on this course. I sincerely believe this will be worth your time.

This is for complete newbies (either to ML/DL or to Keras). If you have had experience before (and are not struggling), it would not be worth your time.

Possible Solution: Use CNN to extract grid features and feed it to LSTM + fully connected output layer to predict value for each sensor, at time t+1.

I've found it to be significantly more difficult than I expected, particularly given the success of convolutional networks for various text classification tasks (e.g. [Understanding how Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) perform text classification with word embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-how-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-perform-text-classification-with-word-d2ee64b9dd0b)).

I thought I'd reach out to this group for some thoughts - would love any feedback on how I'm approaching the problem (huge apologies if this isn't really the right place to ask this).

Basically, what I'm trying to do is:

* Train a 3-layer convolutional autoencoder that takes as input a sequence of N tokens (I've been working with between 10-20 length sequences)
* 300d GloVe embeddings for N tokens are retrieved and assembled into a N x 300 'image'
* That 'image' is the input for my autoencoder, which is trained to reconstruct the original 'image' via mean squared error loss

The reconstructions are pretty poor, even after significant training (100k iterations). The loss usually startsaround 0.85 or so and always converges to around 0.13-0.14 a few thousand iterations in, and just hangs there indefinitely.

* Have tried with/without batch normalization, with no real improvement
* Have tried various optimizers (standard SGD, Adam, RMSProp, momentum) with no real improvement
* Tried including max pooling layers, but output was extremely blocky / much worse than without
* Haven't yet tried much in the way of regularization (outside of dropout)

This is just a quick snippet of what the model looks like for reference. Highlights basically are - I've been trying a bunch of different kernel sizes (and #s of filters per convolutional layer), ranging from extending the entire width of the GloVe vector to more standard [5,5], [4,4], [3,3] sizes. The [h,300] kernels are doing the best job of reconstructing the image as far as I can tell (though it's still a pretty poor reconstruction).

Really, I'm mostly just curious to see if there's anything really obviously, blindingly stupid in how I'm conceptually approaching the problem. I've been playing a lot with widely varying hyperparameters to see if that improves the reconstructions, but ultimately my gut feeling is there is something more conceptually wrong with my model than not.

    conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(inputs=data, filters=64, kernel_size=[1, 300], strides=[1,1], padding=""same"", activation=None)
    conv1_bn = tf.layers.batch_normalization(inputs=conv1, axis=-1, momentum=0.9, epsilon=0.001, center=True, scale=True, training = is_training)

We are happy to announce that the CORe50 dataset from the paper CORe50: a new Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition (CoRL, 2017) is now publicly available at the link: https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/

CORe50, specifically designed for Continuous/Lifelong Learning and Object Recognition, is a collection of more than 500 videos (30fps) of 50 domestic objects belonging to 10 different categories. Instance level granularity, temporal coherence, first-person point-of-view and very different environmental conditions and backgrounds (outdoor sessions included) is what makes CORe50 particularly useful for assessing Continuous Learning techniques.

On top of the CORe50 dataset we are also happy to release a 3-way benchmark with multiple baselines and a living leaderboard to keep track of the progresses made in this new exciting area! For downloading the code, the dataset, the benchmark and more, check out the official website https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/

In Coursera Hyperparameter Tuning Course, I learned about using SoftMax for multi class problems.

I am trying to apply it to different problems to check if I really got it. Just for fun, I chose a problem that I know the deep net won't learn, but I would like to see it trying to learn.

The problem is: try to predict the number of a lottery here in Brazil called ""megasena"". The result of each game is a set of 6 numbers between 1 and 60. The training set is the last 2.000 games and each training example has 4 features: 

	1. the number of the game (eg. the 1st... until the 2000th)
	2. day of the game
	3. month of the game
	4. year of the game

For each Y of the example, I have a column with 60 rows, and in each row where the number was chosen in a particular game, I assigned ""1"". Eg. If the game 11th the result was (1, 2, 3, 5, 59 60), Y (column vector) will be = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0...., 0, 1, 1]. If the 12th game the result was (2, 4, 7, 57, 58, 60), Y will be = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0..., 0, 1, 1, 0, 1].

It is a little bit different of the example in the course. In the class, the professor used an example where he has only one row where ""1"" was assigned for each example (when one row is ""1"", other rows are ""0""). In my experiment, I have 6 rows in the same column with ""1"" assigned and the other 54 rows with ""0"".

Do you guys know if I can use the same configuration for my example? (relu -&gt; relu -&gt; ... -&gt; relu -&gt; softmax?

Or as I have more than one row with ""1"", I should use another configuration or activation function?

Thank you! :)

The speaker was Ilya Sutskever, who (along with Geoffrey Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky) started the revolution in deep learning by winning the 2012 ImageNet challenge with a convolutional neural network architecture.

The talk by Sutskever was mostly theoretical, and at the end of the talk, someone in the audience asked how Sutskever initialized his weights. His reply was the following:

""That's part of a dirty bag of tricks that nobody publishes.""

Deep learning has certainly come a long way since then. In only a matter of five years, deep learning has now reached the masses. A whole dozen deep learning frameworks (https://en.wikipedia.org//Comparison_of_deep_learning_soft) have been set up. Online courses on deep learning now include those by influential academics, such as Geoffrey Hinton (https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks), Andrew Ng (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) and Andrej Karpathy (http://cs231n.stanford.edu). Top researchers such as Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville have even published a book (http://www.deeplearningbook.org) on deep learning. Hell, we can now even train a state-of-the-art cats-and-dogs model in just 10 lines of code (see the first lecture of fast.ai).

Finally, let me recall a story from my own learning experience. In my machine learning class, we are still being taught how to train our model with good-old ""step-wise learning rate annealing"". Jeremy Howard, on the other hand, teaches you (in the very first lecture of the 2017 fast.ai course) how to create a state-of-the-art model using ""stochastic gradient descent with restarts"" (see under the heading 'Improving our model': https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb).
