I'm a psychologist with no significant expertise in mathematics and 
I tried doing the online course on python for deep learning from datacamp.com, however, I felt like I needed some more basic knowledge about Python before I could complete the tasks at that course. Therefore, I jumped into their intro course, which has a focus on data science. Is this the right way to go if I want to be able to code deep learning in python or is there better ways?

* Manage and explore data
* Train models
* Evaluate models
* Deploy models
* Make predictions
* Monitor predictions

Ideally, a platform would be relatively easy to setup, allow practical data exploration and management, distributed/parallel model training (e.g. hyperparameter tuning), model deployment into docker containers etc.

I'm going to perform color enhancement method for any natural images. And of course, color sampling is a huge task now, I have to prepare condition for each key-color sampling given then also prepare &amp; pick the best enhancement function for it. I was thinking if I could load tons of sample pictures instead, have my system test them against each other, and figure out its own enhancement rules from all testing.  I'm able to do it using OpenCV already.
  
I'm not that familiar with Deep Learning, we don't even have deep learning course at my university, but I'm interested in the idea and ready to learn. I'm not even sure if this can be done or not, but I wonder what kind of approaches should I learn to achieve my goal ? Is Deep Learning --&gt; Neural Network a good start ? In my case, to which method in DeepLearning should I go with ? Any reference / advice will be highly appreciated.

or 
 - Should I train 20 smalls CNN (each one corresponding to each category) and another one to decide in which CNN should look (like if it should look into the ""Clothes"" CNN or ""Cellphones"" CNN).

I had learnd WTO rulings so far, and this rule and its jurisdiction is quite predictable.

I'd like to launch a project-group which shares the common interest to learn and develop the model for learning WTO rulings - like train the model with factual relation each WTO dispute case with the Panel report as labelled data(since it includes the jurisdiction whether a party's claim is right and wrong)

As far as I know each region globally has the Moot WTO ruling competition, so we can later on hand in our auto-generated panel report for the competition as a turing test-like trial.

I have a dataset of about 250k examples. The examples consist of 130 columns and there are about 1200 classes that need to be classified. I tried training this using a regular softmax, with three hidden layers. It is taking really long, even with a GPU (close to 24 hours). Increasing the minibatch size helped, but not too much (it is currently set to 400). The learning rate is 0.0001, should I increase it a bit, as the training set is very large?

I read that sampled softmax(tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss) can potentially speed up the training. But I don't understand the signature. So far, I was computing the cost by using the logits from the last hidden layer and labels from my training set. But this method requires me to put in weights and biases. Do I initialize new weights? Why is this needed? Is there a sample source code that implements this?

I would really appreciate any help with this.

 - Prologue: The Deep Learning Tsunami
 - The Centuries Old Machine Learning Algorithm
 - The Folly of False Promises
 - The Thaw of the AI Winter
- [Part 2](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning-part-2/) we will look into several strains of research that made rapid progress following the development of backpropagation and until the late 90s, which we shall see later are the essential foundations of Deep Learning.
 - Neural Nets Gain Vision
 - Neural Nets Go Unsupervised
 - Neural Nets Gain Beliefs
- [Part 3](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning-part-3/)  we will continue to see the swift pace of research in the 90s, and see why neural nets ultimately lost favor much as they did in the late 60s.

 - Neural Nets Get Loopy
 - A New Winter Dawns
- [Part 4](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning-part-4/)  we will get to the end of our story and see how deep learning emerged from the slump neural nets found themselves in by the late 90s, and the amazing state of the art results it has achieved since.

Currently, I am finishing up my master's degree in applied statistics. I did my undergraduate study in biology and economics.

I first heard about deep learning when alphago was on the news. Since then, I was interested in the topic but only got to consume some surface information about it (watching video lectures about it, videos of concepts or following through really simple tutorials on website). But never thought I would dive deeply into it. because, first I am not from any computer science background so my knowledge of computation is very basic.
Second, I am not good at programming. I can code in R,SAS or Python but haven't touched any low level language such as C, C++ etc.

But recently, I am thinking I want to do something truly interests me. Currently, I am finishing up my master thesis on modelling with medical data (oncology) and was planning on applying to the jobs in pharmaceutical industry.

So, this plan has changed, I want to start phd in deep learning within 2 years from now (if this is in any way possible). I am dedicating all my off work hours (for my thesis) reading textbooks about it, watching through all the high quality lecture series available and coding in python.

First, after my master, I want to get a job that I can have some experiences in deep learning (again, I wonder if this is in any way possible) for about 2 years,  studying &amp; strengthening my knowledge on the topic.

I am here if anyone can give just any advice, 

Is this feasible plan?

What kind of programming language should I learn other than 
R and Python?

What kind of low level jobs in deep learning do I have a chance to get after my master?

Just any advice will be appreciated, Thanks

Through the use of computer vision and deep learning technology, my client has developed the most powerful and effective biometrics authentication system in the world. The successful hires for these positions will be afforded the opportunity to develop and enhance cutting-edge biometric authentication algorithms, which will contribute towards revolutionizing security as we know it. My client is an alumnus from one of the most prestigious start-up accelerators, and has attracted multi mn investments from previous investors in some of the most successful tech start-ups.

You will have an MSc or PhD from a world-leading university, in a field such as, but not limited to, Deep Learning, Machine Learning or Computer Vision. You will have a broad knowledge of Deep Learning frameworks, techniques and have experience with developing and applying novel Deep Learning algorithms. Experience across CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs is seen to be highly desirable. You will ideally count Python as your expert language, where you have extensive experience developing code using associated Deep Learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow and Keras. However, experts in both C++ and Java will also be considered. A stellar publication record, with acceptance at conferences including NIPS, ICML, ECCV and CVPR etc. would be very highly regarded.

Research Scientist

This position is very research heavy, incorporating lots of innovation, novel side projects (akin to a research lab) and the chance to publish and showcase work. The hire for this role will be an autonomous and innovative individual, who continuously strives to find ground breaking new methods of developing technology. Research has been a key part to my clients success in building the most powerful and effective biometrics authentication system in the world and you will be working to continually improve their flagship product.

Research Engineer

This position heavily revolves around optimisation, improving the accuracy of algorithms and overall efficiency of my clients models. Examples of tasks include decreasing the amount of data required to train their neural nets and fine-tuning hyperparameters. You will be working closely with the research scientists, but the work you will undertake is more applied and closer to the products.

This firm offers competitive salaries and the position represents a remarkable opportunity to join an established yet relatively early stage company, with plans to grow significantly in 2018.
