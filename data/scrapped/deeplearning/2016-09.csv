I'm trying to implement a DNN for image prediction. The inputs are an image and a motion vector (e.g.: up:-1, right:3, down:4, left:-5) and the output would be the next image. For the training we would have the image, the motion vector and the correct next image (imagine like sequencial frames of a video, for instance).
I'm having troubles implementing this net and the vast majority of the things I find online are mostly for classification in specific labels. In this case there aren't any specific labels as the pixels in the output can be in different ranges of gray (if we consider a gray scale to simplify). Is this a correct approach? Should I try to implement a unsupervised learning approach or should I try to do a one-hot for each pixel (being the labels the different shades of gray)?

BTW, I'm using TensorFlow.

Does anyone have any suggestions or know any tutorial? Any idea/suggestion/help would be great.

However, I'm stuck with an error I'm unable to resolve and am unsure how to poke at it to make progress.  I've clearly got some mental wires crossed or missing and could use some assistance.

I've successfully serialized the training data from CIFAR10, the 1st step.  However, when I run do_train in transfer_cifar10_softmax.py, I hit the following error:

    ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (10, 2048) for Tensor u'pool_3/_reshape:0', which has shape '(1, 2048)'    

Here's the [top part of the graph](http://imgur.com/a/MsOu9) with the transfer learning node expanded (pool).

This is the shape of the passed-in feed_dict data for sess.run in the do_train:
Xi shape:  (10, 2048)
Yi shape:  (10, 10)

Obviously, CIFAR10 has 10 classes which is what is driving the 10-dim.  

*  How do I convert the 10x2048 Xi data into the 1x2048 that the pool_3/reshape is expecting?  
*  WHY is the pool_3/_reshape expecting a 1x2048 from pool_3?
*  (Possibly a related question) What is the role of the encode_one_hot (line 200-ish) in the process?  I understand what the function is doing but what's the role of the result of the function?

Any hints or keen observations would be much appreciated....

I am attempting to use faster R-CNN on a original dataset and have been running into issues. I have taken my data, about 700 images and segmented it into 6 classes. I changed the num_classes, cls_score, and bbox_pred parameters to 6 and 24 as instructed by a tutorial. However. When ran every input image has the same boxes in the same location, and the same cls_score. 

Does this issue sound familiar to anyone, and if so what.
