I am just getting my toes wet with deep learning. How do you typically solve this problem:

I recently trained a NN to do object classification using the CIFAR-100 image dataset. I built an iOS app which uses the camera as input to this NN. However, when the camera is aimed at nothing in particular (none of the 100 categories the NN was trained on), I am not sure how to handle this situation. Is it possible to add 'None' as one of the categories to train the NN on, so that if none of the categories are seen in an example it just outputs 'None'?

Currently I am working on a deep learning project that uses tensorflow to predict stock prices. I think I currently lack a bigger picture of how DP can be applied to this type of problem due to the insufficent data set and features. I will post my thoughts and what I've done and would like to hear people's opionions on this.

Here is what I've done so far.

Let's say I pick one stock and its history prices of past 30 years, and price is given in a montly basis. And I use that as my Y.

For X, I use features like company revenues, profits, growth rate, etc for that company as well as interest rate, inflation rate. Also that data is spread in a monthly basis.

So the total sample size is about ~550 (80% used as training set and 20% as testing set) and currently I am just using various shallow layers (1-3) and with various hidden units in each layer (2-30) along with combinations of different learning rate, optimizers, batch sizes etc. So far I couldn't get any good results.

Am I doing something completely off the chart here? I would like to make sure I am at least on the right track.

I am trying to build a model which predicts what is the best time to do something. (for example submit something to a processor)

In my training set, I have examples of when something successfully works, but I also have examples of when it doesn't work. It is sourced from a skewed source (where batch jobs run early in the morning with a large amount of submissions)

At the moment I'm filtering out all the non-successful attempts when I build the time-of-day predictor, but I'd like to do some kind of negative reward for the ones which don't work.

I'm concerned that what I am actually doing is just teaching the time the most frequent submissions come in, instead of the most positive.

Is there any papers, tutorials, or suggestions? (ideally with TF examples ;-) )

My immediate thought is to build a negative softmax response so that each other hour has 1/23 weight in it for when I do backprop for the negative responses? 

are there better ways?

I'm currently going through Udacity's course on parallel programming using CUDA. I'm also planning to do the assignments of Stanford's CS231n.

The PC I have is an HTPC and clearly not suited for deep learning (Pentium G3240, $4gb RAM, intel HD Graphics). However, I was thinking a low end CUDA enabled GPU may come in handy in my learning process.

As I said, I would use it to learn CUDA, do CS231n assignments (except the final project) and also give a try to Caffe or TensorFlow. I'm aware any serious project would require AWS or a decent GPU.

Would a GT 730 2gb DDR 5 be ok? Would it be better choose the 4gb DDR3 version instead? (I know there's a 4gb DDR5 version, but I want the card to be passive cooled).

I was reading this article on detecting rectangles in an image, [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/object-detection-with-neural-networks-a4e2c46b4491). My doubt is in the part where the model works fine with detecting a single object, but struggles with two rectangles detection.

The author reasons this as follows:

    We train our network on the leftmost image in the plot above. Lets say 
    that the expected bounding box of the left rectangle is at position 1 in the 
    target vector (x1, y1, w1, h1), and the expected bounding box of the 
    right rectangle is at position 2 in the vector (x2, y2, w2, h2). Apparently, 
    our optimizer will change the parameters of the network so that the first 
    predictor moves to the left, and the second predictor moves to the right. 
    Imagine now that a bit later we come across a similar image, but this 
    time the positions in the target vector are swapped (i.e. left rectangle at 
    position 2, right rectangle at position 1). Now, our optimizer will pull 
    predictor 1 to the right and predictor 2 to the left  exactly the opposite 
    of the previous update step! In effect, the predicted bounding boxes stay 
    in the center.

I don't understand how this reasoning is correct, apart from the fact that when they try to flip the rectangles to mitigate this error, accuracy actually improves (so there's experimental observation, but not much theoretical reasoning).

The reason I think so is because in case of single rectangle also the network has to learn for all differently placed objects just as in the two-rectangle-case, so there too, it should predict boxes in the somewhat the center only. I have to concede I am only a noob in this, so I would love to find out where I am wrong in my reasoning, because experimentally I am wrong (i.e. accuracy does improve when rectangles are flipped).

Thoughts? Also if this is not the correct sub/forum for these type of questions, please feel free to guide me towards those that better suit the content.
And finally thank you for reading :)
