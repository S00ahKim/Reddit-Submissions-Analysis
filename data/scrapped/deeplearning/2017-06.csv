I'm a hobbyist and am fascinated with the coolness of deep learning. I have observed across numerous youtube videos and several publications where the training image resolution is generally more than 100 pixels x 100 pixels.

I like to ask, if I am interested to train and therefore detect objects other than handwritten digits with a resolution of say approximately 30 pixels x 30 pixels:

1) How does Deep Learning technique perform for training samples with small image resolutions?

2) What architecture/technique can I look into to explore further?

I'm afraid to sound lazy but I am absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of information out there.

Then you give him a set of pictures and it has to decide whether it sees an ""A"" or not. Simple enough (in theory).

But where do I have to start? What do I even need in order to do that? Is it deep learning or machine learning or AI or.......?

I would be happy with a few tags that are more specific than ""object detection"" or ""deep learning"".

FlappyBird game with one action and a goal to survive sounds like a good example.

---

I'm new to machine/deep learning, it seems a rather broad field! I have experience programming but not quite sure where to look to get started here. I see alot of pattern/feature matching/manipulation going on, usually with images or audio.

**What are the terms to look into if you have some actions/events that can occur and you have a rough goal/outcome desired and would like the AI to learn what is effective/ineffective based on datasets it's given?** I saw a video on MarI/O which was an AI with genetic algorithm to learn how to play a level(I think it had learned mostly how to play that single level really well, overfitting?) and I found that quite interesting.

Another example could be guessing passwords, a large dataset of known passwords could be fed in, and it could guess what letters are most likely to follow after a previous one or common word combinations/patterns. I've read of this being done with markov chains(or hidden markov models, not sure). This sounds more in line with what deep learning is good at.

I think I am more interested in the ones like MarI/O where the AI has actions it can perform with a measurable goal to achieve while learning from it's actions/decisions that fail. The issue with that propped up was the likely overfitting to that specific level, how would you avoid that, would more levels help or would it need to be combined with other methods so it actually learnt how to play well to procedurally generated levels?

Could I take a more basic game like FlappyBird(one button to move the player up while they otherwise fall to gravity trying to dodge obstacles) and teach it how to survive the procedural generated level by using that one action?",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Let's say I want to classify these instances as Good/Bad.
Let's say I have trained a model on one dataset (MNIST) and now I want to expand it to another dataset like cifar-100, in which every instance could have 100 different labels.
I want to design a model (Neural Network) that could be trained on one dataset and trained on another dataset.

For example, people trained AlexNet on ImageNet and finetune it on another dataset by removing the last layer, and adding another layer with different size.

How could I do similar thing when the constraint is on the input not the output of the network?
Is it possible to design a network that could have a variable length input? Or is it possible to change maybe 1,2 layers and finetune the network on another dataset?

I tried both L1/L2 loss and a simple weighting scheme but it does not really help (about the same performance).  I also tried different architectures (simple one with 3 conv laxers and 2 fully connected) and a 18 Layer Resnet. The Resnet improves the performance a fair bit. But it is still not satisfactory.
