This is my first non academic project in deep learning and i feel that i need some advice to know in which direction i can go.
Let's start: I want to use deep learning to build a model that recognizes many characteristic in an image. To be precise, i want to create a model that allows me to recognize in a photo:
.if the person is a MALE/Female.
.what type of clothing is he/she wearing( i will create a list of labels corresponding to some possible type of clothing.)
.what are the colors of the clothes he/she is wearing.
I really need some guidance in order to start thinking of the possible techniques that could help me go deeper in this project.
Do you advise me to start thinking first of a model that can  distinguish male/femal?Or do i need to think of the subject from another perespective?
What are the topics that i need to look for?
All responses are welcome. I do really want to know what do you think of this guys.

Today my company got some request to develop/train a network that can classify ""cooked"" instant noodles from two different company.

This company is a major instant noodle manufacturer in my region and they want to crawl the blog posts about small-sized restaurants who serves cooked instant noodles and hope to check whether they are using their product or not just by the blog posted pics of Instant Noodles. 

The attached two pictures are the example of them, one is from the company that requested this weird but interesting task and the other one is from their major competitor.

I had checked which network the famous ""Not Hot Dog App"" had used, but still however, remains two main questions.

1) Would it be possible? (This question is minor, because anyway I will try)

2) How many qualitative training pics would be required to get fancy and accurate learned network? 

We can gather as many pics as we want using the company's whole employees :D Anyway that's a good news.

Imagine that all employees in the company just got text message from the CEO saying, ""Go home and take a picture of noodles and upload it. That's your job today"" 

LOL (still, my question is serious and valid)

* gender

* race

* susceptibility to diseases

Does anyone know of a dataset that can be freely downloaded to build such a model? Also what would be the best kind of data to start with?

The framework which I know the best is PyTorch, therefore I was looking for an implementation of some detection neural network (i.e. SSD, Faster-RCNN...) implemented in this framework.
I've found a nice open source implementation of Faster-RCNN (https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch) which I picked for now (however I'm open to hear if there are other recommended implementations which might be better / easier, etc).

I've succeeded on training the network on a dataset it supports (coco/pascal voc).
In order to train on my dataset, which is annotated in a custom csv file, I have to convert the annotations to coco or pascal voc.

First problem: My dataset has coarse-grained labels (large car, small car, etc) and then fine-grained labels (features of the cars), where the fine-grained labels are only presented for some of the coarse-grained labels (only for cars), and are different for each coarse grained label.
How can I deal with that? The COCO / Pascal Voc formats does not support fine-grained labels.

Second problem: My dataset is annotated with oriented bounding boxes (4 points which are not rectangular), and the other datasets have rectangular / horizontal bounding boxes. I thought about wrapping each oriented bounding box in a horizontal one so it would fit the coco / pascal voc formats, but... I'm losing the flexibility of the oriented boxes.

Third problem: Some of the images are too large to run on my Tesla K40 GPU (they are ~4000x2000), considering the benchmarks posted in the git repo.

I have a question about the relationship between the visualization result of the Attention Map and the actual meaning.

In case of applying Attention to video information, it is applied to Response Map that passes through neural network instead of applying it to original input image in general.

If so, can you be sure that the Patch with high output in the Attention Map actually emphasizes the same position in the original image? (Of course, the Attention Map is smaller than the original image, so resizing is necessary.)

In the case of feature maps after passing enough neural networks, the Receptive Field of each output value will be large enough to occupy most of the original image.
In my opinion, the fact that the Attention Value corresponding to one Resonse Value is large can not confirm that the position is emphasized in the original input image.

If the Attention Map is directly applied to the original input image, it can be said that the output of each Attention Patch represents the importance of the corresponding position in the input image. However, most papers apply attention to feature maps in the middle of the neural network rather than the original image.

[[Picture 1][1]][1] 
 [[Picture 2][2]][2] [[Picture 3][3]][3] [[Picture 4][4]][4] [[Picture 5][5]][5]

Associated to these images are labels for the digit with the largest pixel size. My goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the largest digit in an image by pixel size.

To that end, I used transfer learning on the resnext model, but only found an accuracy of 60%.

Given that [this](https://github.com/kkweon/mnist-competition) implementation uses transfer learning to train a model to predict MNIST digits, I would now like to crop each training image to retain only the largest digit and then train the model using the [linked](https://github.com/kkweon/mnist-competition) implementation.

So, my question is, how I do crop the training images to retain only the digit in each image with the largest size.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a few questions related to this model from 2016: (you'll need to translate if you don't read Japanese)

https://elix-tech.github.io/ja/2016/06/02/kaggle-facial-keypoints-ja.html

(it is based off of a 2014 model here: http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/)

&amp;nbsp;

1) This is from 2016, &amp; subsequently 2014, models that use CNN &amp; methods like Dropout... are there better-known, but still simple, ways to implement this model now in 2018?

&amp;nbsp;

2) Is a larger training set better for overfitting here? One method used in the model is to randomly horizontally flip the images and keypoints--but keeping the same data size. What if I have a training set that already includes the flipped images &amp; keypoints... would it be better for those to be randomly generated in training vs including them in the larger dataset?

&amp;nbsp;

3) Suppose I want to apply facial keypoints model to video, is there a more efficient way to do this vs running the model on individual frames?",1,3

For example if I use cosine similarity to find headlines similar to a given headline and if the headline I am checking for is sports related, I get other similar headlines that are sports related

This got me thinking and I experimented further by creating a kmeans cluster model on these document vectors. I was expecting to see   all headlines of one category being assigned a unique cluster. But that is not happening, in each cluster created by kmeans I am getting articles of all categories, though there is one category that is always dominant (60 to 70%) in each of the clusters. 

Why would clustering algorithm fail to place documents of each category in separate clusters in this document vector space?

Is it possible to use clustering in the manner I described above to group documents by theme, in the document vector space?

So, here what I am doing:
I created a folder with two labeled subfolders: cats and dogs. In each folder I have 1000 image of cats/dogs.
I built iteratively an numpy array in which I put my images after converting them to arrays ( I have chosen (200,200,3) size for each image) and I have up-scaled the array by dividing it by 255. So I got a (2000,200,200,3) up-scaled array.
Then, I create an array for the labels. Since I have two categories, I will have 2 biniary digits for each row of the array: (1,0) if cat and (0,1) if a dog. So I found myself with a (2000,2) array of labels.
Next, I create X_train,Y_train and X_valid,Y_valid ( 70% for train and 30% for valid).
Then I create a neural network with this architecture:
Dense(200x200x3,1000,relu)&gt;&gt;&gt; Dense(1000,500,sigmoid)&gt;&gt;&gt;Dense(500,100,sigmoid)&gt;&gt;&gt;Dense(100,2,softmax) : BACKPROP:loss=categorical_crossentropy,optimizer=adam.

Till now, everything looks fine, the model is trained. But then, when I try to predict values: the model always gives back the same value whatever is the input ( even if i try to predict elements with the training set , i always get the same constant output= array([[0.5188029 , 0.48119715]] )

I do really need help, i don't know why this is happening.. So in order to guide you guys I'll write down all the code corresponding to what I did:

I need to upscale them before feeding them to the neuran netowrk. The big question is: 
Does the method of upscaling influence something?If so, is there an 'absolute' best upscaling methode to be used ? 
PS:I am already familiar with upscaling methods , so what i want to know here is if the choice has an impact, and if so, it does have an impact on what?

Thanks in advance.
