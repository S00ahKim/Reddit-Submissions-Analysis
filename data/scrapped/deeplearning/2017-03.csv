I had the following problem - namely, I am trying to get a complete backwards computation from a vector of values in torch (guided back-propagation).

The module in question is: 
    `cudnn.SpatialConvolution(3 -&gt; 64, 7x7, 2,2, 3,3) without bias`

I'm trying to perform the following computation:
   ` currentModule:backwards(batch:cuda(), previousGradInput)`

where `batch` is a input image, converted to batch input, and `currentGradOutput` is a vector of previously computed gradients such that 

     th&gt; currentGradOutput:size()
           1
          64
          112
          112
    [torch.LongStorage of size 4]


According to my calculations, gradient w.r.t weights should be of the size of the input image, however, it returns NULL. 

Any ideas where my thinking is wrong? I'm using torch7, and Facebook's resnet model. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm interested in (deep learning) algorithms which are able to generate not a point forecast, but a probability distribution of the target value in a time series. So, say we have a real-valued time series (not necessarily evenly-spaced in time, but that doesn't matter for now) and we'd like to learn to predict its value at a certain point in the future. How do I generate not just a number, but a whole distribution (through MC, I assume), and which model will be best fit to make it unbiased yet precise?

Edit: 
To add a bit more details. The time series is stationary, but undergoes regime switching. That is, there are points when it exhibits new kind of behaviour and we'd expect to have a wide (very uncertain) forecast. I thought something derived from LSTM might work here, as it is well suited for detecting the context, but I'm not sure what is the most efficient way of adapting it to this particular situation...
