I've been recently introduced to deep learning and I would like to try it in object classification. I read some papers and saw some object categories datasets, but initially I'm looking for some models already trained, which I could use to observe how deep models visualize objects in practice.

I found this github which I'm going to try: https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/theano_alexnet

However, I'm looking for more different models to perform a comparison. Do you know where can I find those models?

Thank you in advance. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The images vary in quality and way a given chemical structure (think of it as a graph, or connectivity table) is drawn.

Q1: How many machines (do they need to have GPU?) do you think one would need for such a project?

Q2: How long would one need to extract the graph information from such an image, in terms of machine time? Seconds, minutes?

Q3: What kind of error rates are we likely looking at? Current solutions like e.g. OSRA take forever (minutes) and produce a high error rate.",8,3,False,self,,,,,
