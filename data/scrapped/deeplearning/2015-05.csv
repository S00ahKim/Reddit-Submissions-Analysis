Also, explain WHY those areas of math are important.

I don't have a math degree (finance unfortunately) so I want to know what are the minimum classes I am going to need to take to get into a PhD focused on deep learning?

I believe I am mathematically gifted and could get at least in the the top 5 percentile for the quant of GRE.  However my ""gift"" didn't start kicking in until I was like 17.  I started at a community college and did very well up to Calculus II.  I pretty much loved math.  Then a few things happened.  I took 1 absolutely awfully taught class during the summer (this guy was like 4 standard deviations worse than any other teacher I've had) but because it was a prereq, I had to take it.  I didn't think it would affect my love of math but it did.  Around that time I was reading on higher level math on my own, stuff like ""Proofs without words"" and ""Concepts of Modern Mathematics"".  I was also having to transfer from my CC to a state university.  This was during the hedge fund boom, and hearing about the ridiculous salaries that people made in quantitative finance, and after getting rejectd from a great universities math degree, since I was going to a lesser university, I decided to be more practical.  Finance had a lot of math, or so I was told.

If deep learning hadn't come along I probably woudn't have changed my opinion.  I had taken a strong interest in neuroscience for the past 4 years anyways, but reading about deep learning has allowed me to understand higher math, which I have never taken formally, but I know I need to. The idea of an ""algerbra of reasoning"" as posited in ""From Machine Learning to Machine Reasoning"" and the other ideas are amazing.  I understand linear algerbra, but I never took a class.  The way I understand it, is that vectors are like ""higher dimensional analogs"" of regular numbers.  Hence you need a new algebra to do stuff with them.  Matricies are like functions for these higher-dimensional numbers (aka vectors).

I understand how you can map things in an n-dimensional parameter space and like things will end up close together, possibly on some manifold.  The fact that these spatial relations can define an algerbra which can be used for reasoning as proven by https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ is amazing.

Basically, I want to take classes, and get the math I will need, and get into a PhD program focused on deep learning.

As far as I understand, graduate schools will let you in for a different subject, but usually you have to take certain courses, so I want to take the courses that will be necessary to get into deep learning, and perhaps I can do research with a professor as well (is that likley?)  Because I heard undergrad research is a must for grad school.  I want to do research.

So what math classes should I take?
