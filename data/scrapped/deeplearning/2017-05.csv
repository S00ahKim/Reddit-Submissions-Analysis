I am a professional classical musician and teacher, I am also an amateur Go player.  I have been intrigued by machine learning since Alphago...

Lately I have been wondering the possiblity of using machine learning technique to teach basic level of musicianship training...
There are many attempts to use A.I. and machine learning in music but the focus always seem to be on the quantifiable physical quality of sound and music,  like the frequency,  speed,  or harmonic structure etc... in essence,  things that machines are good at identifying.

I wonder if there is any possibility to train a computer to hear music like human.
Like, for entry level music classes.  The ""material"" (simple melodies,  or ryhthms) are relatively straight forward and the ""results"" are usually rather objective,  in comparison with sth like a Beethoven symphony.
I am sure many of us have this experience in music class:  we sing something,  and the teacher would say, ""this note is wrong. "" ""don't slow down here. "" ""be careful in the end"" etc...
I am thinking,  can't we teach a machine to do that?

Rather than finding ""solutions"" we can teach a machine to be a guide on these simple things,  let's say first year or music class of a school children.  I understand it is a rather vague comparison but these things don't seem to be more complicated than the game of Go.

If we keep things simple,  like 100 simple melodies,  the rules can be quite objective and leaves very little room for personal interpretation.  In that case,  is it feasible to teach a machine to become a proficient ""teacher"" in this 100 melodies?

Thx for reading and pls excuse me for my complete lack of knowledge in programming &amp; computer.  Just want to share this idea with someone. ",2,0

34,2017-5-14,2017,5,14,20,6b3crm,Deep Learning and Kernels,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/6b3crm/deep_learning_and_kernels/,NicolaBernini,1494759636,"It seems to me that Deep Learning is mostly about performing an effective Representation Learning. One of the main idea (which justifies the deep nature of this learning strategy) here is to develop a Hierarchical Multi-Layer representation, moving from a High Dimensional Input Space (e.g. the Image Space) to more Abstract and Lower Dimensional Spaces. 
In Supervised Learning, the Representation(s) Learned is (are) biased to allow for a (easy, to some extent) solution of a certain task and indeed final layers are typically classical ones (e.g. Logistic Regression on top of a CNN Stack for Object Classification) 

So basically this idea looks similar to the Kernel based Strategies one: instead of solving a problem in the Input Space looking for a very complex function (i.e. searching over a huge hypothesis space) its better to investigate the possibility of developing a projection into a space where the solution can be easier (i.e. reducing the hypothesis space): so instead of learning a complex nonlinear classification function in the input space its better to develop a mapping into an intermediate abstract space where the solution can be a linear classifier. 

The different I see is that in Kernel based Strategies, like SVM, the Kernel is a prior typically defined as a result of some domain expertise, while in DL based Strategies, like CNN, the Convolutional Kernels are learned from Data. 
However it does not mean CNNs do not need any prior: they actually do but they are at the level of Learning Machine, like Architecture related Priors (e.g. number of layers, connections, ...) and Convolutional Kernel related Priors (e.g. size, stride, ...) 

What do you think ?

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at a decent university in Canada and I am interested to learn about deep learning and neural networks. I know it requires lot of computing power which is why I am thinking of building a powerful linux workstation. As of right now, I am thinking AMD Ryzen 1700, GTX 1060 should suffice. What do you all think?",11,7

I'm dealing with a dataset consisting in some anagraphic data about the users and a target dummy variable that I want to predict (which is subscribed or not). Besides the numerical fixed variables like age etc. I also have a time serie variable, which makes the things quite complex for me. I know how to adapt a CNN for binary classification with panel data, but what should I do when dealing with also (and not only) a time serie? Thanks in advance and keep up the amazing work!",3,2

Really sorry if this is a stupid question or a bad place to ask it. Let me know where to go and I will! 

My understanding of NNs is extremely limited and there's no way I will be able to learn and implement this on my own before next year. Therefore, I am hoping someone can redirect me to something similar which will allow me to customize the code to my needs and just make it work by next week hopefully. 

THE PROJECT:

So I want the program to take a picture of a person wearing glasses (from my HDD) and generate an image without the glasses. I believe I'll need to make use of a convolutional NN. I have 3000 images of 1500 people with and without glasses for training dataset already. Also, I have at my disposal a desktop PC with a GTX 1060.

Thank you for reading and any help will be appreciated! Thank you.",11,1

I haven't found any projects which goal is to increase coding in general, doesn't matter what coding language.
There are projects what take text in and then make and or suggest improvements based on context, but haven't found anything which train or simply generate code from ideas.


Since I'm pretty new to this I don't even know where to start when giving idea and then machines generates the code files.


So I though of simpler approach:
Make a desktop software where you talk in small code concepts and in real time it displays a result or multiple results.
And then with shortcut keys you pretty much copy paste the code snippets from the software.


Example how would it work.
You choose tab ""train"" from software.
Then you create a category (for example Lua)
then you record a message, like ""loop ipairs""
Then you type into text field what this message should represent
     
     for key, value in ipairs(table) do
     
    end

You can listen your recording or make several solutions for same outcome, but the software is trained to get the closest result anyway.
so you press train/ok
and now you choose tab code.
you can make the microphone be open all the time or make it while holding a certain key.
so whenever you say similar text speech you get this code line into software.
and with another shortcut key you can paste it on your code.


This would just be start of code helper software, could implement some macro keys by speech recognition, which open files or move your cursor to spesific point, etc.


What you think about this? does it already exists?
Does anyone want to make such software with me?
