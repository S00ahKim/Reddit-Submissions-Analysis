The Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge is a crowdsourced computational Challenge focused on improving the predictive accuracy of digital mammography for the early detection of breast cancer. The primary benefit of this Challenge will be to establish new quantitative tools based in deep learning that can help decrease the recall rate of screening mammography, with a potential impact on shifting the balance of routine breast cancer screening towards more benefit and less harm.

The challenge has been donated approximately 640,000 mammogram images along with clinical metadata, a fleet of high powered GPU-based servers, and over a million dollars in prize money.

Our public Challenge website where people can register and read all of our details and timing is here:  https://www.synapse.org/Digital_Mammography_DREAM_Challenge

I hope you find this interesting.  We feel the challenge will only be successful with the engagement of people, such as yourselves, with strong machine learning expertise.",0,1

I've dabbled in XGBoost using Python.  I've also bought a GPU, installed Cuda, and have been using Keras to understand more about deep learning.  It is really an exciting field and I'm learning as much as I can.

What I want to do is to buy some robotic arms and to try to teach them how to make a hamburger.  I imagine there would be some mirroring function where I could stick a camera in front of a kitchen/stove and I could manipulate the arms to so the neural net could learn how to pick up and grill patties, add lettuce, tomatoes, condiments, and finally wrap it in paper.

I was just wondering what the general approach would be in terms of hardware, software, and implementation. 

For hardware, I am thinking having 4 arms working in unison.  Humans have hand and fingers which are very dexterous.  Right now you can buy a robot arms with 2 fingers to grapple, so having an additional 4 arms would mean 8 fingers total. 

For a computer would four Nvidia Teslas work?  What about hard disk space?  How much would I need?

For software what kind of neural net would work best?  Is it possible to use an existing API or library to teach the robot?  How many hamburgers would I have to teach it to make before it can actually make it on its own?

Thanks in advanced for your input.  I would love to start on this project if it were indeed technically and financially possible for a enthusiast like myself. ",5,10

I recently built a machine with an nvidia gtx 1070 so that I could dive in to deep learning and image processing with cuda, tensorflow, torch, etc..

I've tried a variety of distros, include Mint 17.0-3 (Ubuntu 14.04) and Ubuntu 16. The main problem I'm having is getting the right drivers set up. I've read through a lot of materials online and come pretty close to getting things set up properly, but each time with the different distros I've ultimately run into a problem, which appear to be compatibility issues with different drivers and different versions of libraries I'm trying to install.

So, any tips for the most stable OS for running cuda and other deep learning libraries with modern nvidia drivers?",6,2
