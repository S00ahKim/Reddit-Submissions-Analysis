In this video it talks about variables that go into Big-loss function should have zero mean and equal variances. I cant figure about which variables it is talking about? Are they weights and biases or are they soft-max function and labels in the Big-loss function? And how zero mean and equal variance would help in optimization?

The other question I have is, in the video it talks about weight initialization randomly using Gaussian distribution, I cannot understand how can we initialize weights using gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sigma? And where optimizer will move the point (initialized weight), up or down to find the local minima?

So can you recommend me a book that I should study before taking this course, so that problems like these don't occur ?",0,3,False,self,,,,,

However, once the neural network trained, it's not that easy to make things go real-time. A lot of people seem to face this unfortunate constraint that limits the scope of R-T applications for Deep Learning with existing tools. 

So, before giving up the deep learning approach, I would like to ask you guys if there are any heuristics that could boost the things up.

Finally, is it better to choose a validation set from a part of the training set than to build a new one ?
