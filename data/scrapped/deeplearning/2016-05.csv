Are any techniques used for gradient stability across so many unrolled LSTM layers (akin to batch normalization)? If anyone has links to relevant papers that would be very useful.,2,3

My question is regarding the 1st step: detects when I speak and record only my audio. Note 2 goals here: (1) super low battery drain, won't record when I'm not speaking. (2) detects only when I speak, so training using my voice is allowed.

How do I do this? Anyone could give a roadmap and pointers to libraries/ tools? Thanks for any suggestion!",1,2

I have a deep neural network I trained using Caffe or Theano frameworks.
I want to use that net on my iPad for another application.

Does anyone know how to do it?

Thanks a bunch,
