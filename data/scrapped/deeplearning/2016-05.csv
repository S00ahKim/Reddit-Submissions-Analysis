My question is regarding the 1st step: detects when I speak and record only my audio. Note 2 goals here: (1) super low battery drain, won't record when I'm not speaking. (2) detects only when I speak, so training using my voice is allowed.

How do I do this? Anyone could give a roadmap and pointers to libraries/ tools? Thanks for any suggestion!",1,2,False,self,,,,,

I have a deep neural network I trained using Caffe or Theano frameworks.

Does anyone know how to do it?
