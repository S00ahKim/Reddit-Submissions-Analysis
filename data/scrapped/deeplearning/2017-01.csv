I am currently working on a dataset of images from an X ray imager that contain very faint blobs that need detection. Initially I tried using computer vision techniques but realized that there is way too much parameter tuning required for it to work reliably, and I have gotten some suggestions that deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks would have better luck with images like this. I was wondering if someone here could comment on that and possibly suggest some good software packages/algorithms to start off with.   

Here is a link to some of my images: in every image, there are four faint but dark blobs approximately around the center of the image. Any thoughts on the effectiveness of CNNs/other learning techniques for images like this are welcome.

Since many of the people seem interested, we could start as early as possible. Could the people interested comment on 

* Where should we conduct our meetings?
* What time would be suitable for all?
* What would be the format of the reading group?

My personal suggestions, we could do a weekly meet on hangouts, preferably Sunday, but I'm up for everyday if it suits every1. Also for the format, as I suggested [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/5lugdc/anybody_interested_in_an_online_reading_group/dbyrcgt/), it would be great if I could teach the book as an MOOC if everyone agrees.

The workstation is mainly for deep learning and optimisation problems. The idea is to start with just one *Titan x Pascal*
but we want to have a machine ready to scale to up to four *Titan X* cards (even though we will probably arrive up to 3).

| desc | model |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| motherboard | Asus Z10PE-D8 WS |
| gpu | Titan X pascal |
| ram | 4 x 32 GB RDIMM DDR4 (PC4-19200) |
| HD | Samsung 850 EVO SSD da 1 TB |
| HD | SATA 6T |
| cooler | 2x Noctua NH-U12DX i4 |
| case | Corsair Obsidian Series 750D Airflow Edition |
| cpu | 2 x Xeon E5 2630 v4 |
| power supply | EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 P2 |

We want a configuration with two CPUs for scientific calculations; the CPU is chosen because it seems to have the best (cores*frequency)/price ratio.

What bothers us the most is the **motherboard**: `Asus Z10PE-D8 WS` seems [to have had troubles](http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Problems-With-ASUS-Z10PE-D8-WS-Dual-Socket-Motherboard-459168.shtml), or `Asus Z10PE-D16 W`. 
Another issue mentioned in http://timdettmers.com/2015/03/09/deep-learning-hardware-guide/
is about the importance of the CACHE size for CPU and GPU clock speed. 
Is 2.2 GHz enough, given the plots in the article?

So, what do you think? Is it a good configuration? 
**Does it make the most of our `Titan X Pascal` cards?** 
Or can it be improved? (the current configuration should cost around 5000$, in principle, we can spend also a bit more, but this was the best power/price conf we managed to do) 

**EDIT:**
So, thank to your comments and other info gathered here and there, we changed some components, the machine is now  more expensive: 

| desc | model |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| motherboard | Asus Z10PE-D8 WS |
| gpu         |**2x Titan X pascal** |

| HD | **Samsung 960 pro M.2 SSD 512 GB** |
| HD | **Samsung 850 pro 1TB** |
| HD | SATA 6T |
| cooler | 2x Noctua NH-U12DX i4 |
| case | Corsair Obsidian Series 750D Airflow Edition |
| cpu | 2 x **Xeon E5 2687W v4** |
| power supply | EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 P2 |

We decided to go as soon as possible for 2x titan X. Following a suggestion, we choose to occupy all the channels  available for the ram for each CPU, so we occupied all the 8 slots. We moved to 960PRO SSD, but only one for slot space reasons. We also decided to pump the CPUs.

Is this bad?",https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/5ootrc/q_playing_around_with_parameters_improves_error/,Awesome_Incarnate,1484738599,"Hi,

I am using a fully connected feed forward classification network in CNTK with 39 inputs, 3 hidden layers with dimensions 1000,750,500 and 7 outputs.

My training set has 180k samples and testing has 60k samples.

Playing around with epochs and minibatch sizes I am able to reduce  my overall test error rate, but the difference between training error rate and testing error rate increases.

For example:

Configuration 1: Train-error = 47%  ;  Test-Error 48%

Configuration 2: Train-error = 44%  ;  Test-Error 46%

Configuration 3: Train-error = 40%  ;  Test-Error 44%

Configuration 4: Train-error = 35%  ;  Test-Error 42%



etc. (Note: this is excellent results for what I am trying to accomplish, post processing results in almost 90% success rate in application)

As you can see, the 2 errors diverge while the error on the test set gets better.

Is this the result of overfitting? Is this something I have to worry about? Any recommendations? 



EDIT: Seems a simple [Wikipedia Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overfitting_svg.svg) gave me an answer. Doh. As long as the validation error doesn't start going up again, it seems ok that the training error decreases faster than the testing error.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Do they need to be the same GPU?

I am a final year undergrad student. For my final project (worth 50% of the year) I am doing some sort of deep learning. I want to use it for playing 2 player turn based games and ideally want to code it from scratch. 

However, in doing some reading on the subject I am finding it hard to clearly understand how it works which is is part because often they seem to be applied to single player games such as Pong.

As a dry run for my actual project code (which is in c#) I was going to code an algorithm to learn Tic Tac Toe in Python (because it is easy to read). However, I am having a hard understanding exactly what the steps of the algorithm are.

Does anyone have any links to pseudo-code or worked examples for simple adversarial games such as Tic Tak Toe?

I need your advise regarding this.

I am currently working on a dataset of images from an X ray imager that contain very faint blobs that need detection. Initially I tried using computer vision techniques but realized that there is way too much parameter tuning required for it to work reliably, and I have gotten some suggestions that deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks would have better luck with images like this. I was wondering if someone here could comment on that and possibly suggest some good software packages/algorithms to start off with. I've looked at some implementations in Nvidia DIGITS and in MATLAB, but it looks like most of those use pretrained models and extensive datasets that focus on real world objects, so I don't know if those would be applicable for my data.   

Here is a link to some of my images: in every image, there are four faint but dark blobs approximately around the center of the image. Any thoughts on the effectiveness of CNNs/other learning techniques for images like this are welcome. The way I was thinking it would work was to train a network by providing a 'label' set of the blobs with bounding boxes for instance: but I suspect this approach would need training with a LOT of images?
