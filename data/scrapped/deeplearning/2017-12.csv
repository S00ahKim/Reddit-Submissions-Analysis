Conv1D: (batch, length, channels)
LSTM: (batch, timeSteps, features)

The output of the Conv1D is = (length - (kernel_size - 1)/strides), and therefore doesn't match the LSTM shape anymore, even without using MaxPooling1D and Dropout.

To be more specific, my training set X has n samples with 1000 time steps and one channel (n_samples, 1000, 1), and I used LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder so y has n samples, 1000 time steps and 5 one hot encoded classes (n_samples, 1000, 5).Since one class is much more prevalent than the others (is actually the absence of signal), I am using loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', sample_weight_mode=""temporal"" and sample_weight to give a higher weight to time steps containing meaningful classes.
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv1D(128, 3, strides=1, input_shape = (1000, 1), activation = 'relu'))
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(5, activation='softmax')))
    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['categorical_accuracy'], sample_weight_mode=""temporal"")
    print(model.summary())
When I try to fit the model I get this error message: 
**Error when checking target: expected time_distributed_1 to have shape (None, 998, 1) but got array with shape (100, 1000, 5).**

PyTorch seems more python like. But tensorflow has huge community and lota and lots of tutorials.

""Another perspective on deep learning is that depthenables the computer to learn a multistep computer program. Each layer of the representation can be thought of as the state of the computers memory after executing another set of instructions in parallel. Networks with greater depth can execute more instructions in sequence. Sequential instructions oer great power because later instructions can refer back to the results of earlier instructions. According to this view of deep learning, **not all the information in a layers activations** necessarily encodes factors of variation that explain the input.""

It is unclear to me how the link between the first convolutional layer (ReLU Conv1) and the primary capsules layer (PrimaryCaps) is designed. In implementations I have come across on the web, it seems that we apply convolution again to ReLU Conv1, get 256 feature maps and then resize them to 32 vector maps. So, we would employ convolution to get PrimaryCaps. This seems to contradict information given in the paper [Section 4]:

""Each primary capsule output sees the outputs of all 256  81 Conv1 units whose receptive fields overlap with the location of the center of the capsule.""

The paper suggests that either 1) each element of each local capsule vector is fully-connected to each local unit in ReLU Conv1 or 2) the first element of a capsule vector is connected to units 1:32 of ReLU Conv1, the second element of the capsule is connected to untis 33:64 and so on. It is unclear to me which is the case. In particular, option 1) looks very much like a fully-connected layer.

We plan on building GPU server(s), which will be doing GPU heavy tasks - mostly AI and hopefully mining in spare time.

I know there are many comercial pre-build machines, but to be honest, they are way overpriced. I want to build it myself. Want to fit 4-8 gpus, probably GTX 1080 Ti's reference designs - cooling reasons. The most challenging thing will be finding right MOBO and case. For tasks like this we want to use pci-e x16. So I will probably have to use risers, which are x16 to x16. There are not many mobos, which provide that many x16 slots. :( Do you have any tips, where to start? Any tips for cpu? Thanks

For chassis id like to use something like this: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16811147154

but they are pretty hard to get in Europe, will have to find different one probably.

as an update equation for mathematical optimization. It was the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of an equation. I thought this method mostly applies for minimization in machine learning as cost is always defined as a positive real valued function. But it was pointed out to me that the update equation of newton-raphson method, which is x = x - y / dy_dx, is unstable at local minimas (where dy_dx = 0) since it makes the update burst to infinity.

I kept playing with this equation more since it gave me the smoothest curve for what I had been trying to do -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer.ipynb and, I was firm on the idea that the update equation must include the cost term (the Einstein's space-time analogy: The dimension of cost is connected with all the parameter dimensions).

Eventually, I landed on this update equation, x = x - ((y * dy_dx) / (y + dy_dx2)); dy_dx = derivative of y wrt. x link to code -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer%202.0.ipynb found in last section: ""Equation 2: modified from newton-raphson method"".

To relate this update equation with the title: if we consider the update portion of the equation -&gt; g(x, y) = (y * x) / (y + x2) ; y &gt;= 0 It is quite similar to adam since there is a square gradient term in the denominator and the gradient term in the numerator. This equation doesn't use momentum (running averages) and, the learning_rate is replaced by cost (y).

Now, in Adam, the alpha is initially manually set and is utilised as per the decay equation -&gt; lr_t &lt;- learning_rate * sqrt(1 - beta2t) / (1 - beta1t). WIth the equation that I have mentioned, the hypothesis is that this decay is kind of estimating the cost term itself.

Link to the 3d curve of the g(x, y) function -&gt; https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/?expression=(x*y)%2F(x%2B(y*y))&amp;xRange=0%2C+200&amp;yRange=-100%2C+100&amp;resolution=25

Please let me know what you think about this hypothesis and what it's implications are. I would be thankful and highly grateful if you could point me to some more relevant research so that I can move forward with this. Thank you!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

After reading many posts, I have generated a list: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/jBBqYr

We do have several must have preferences:
1. since we already have two Titan XP, we need to house both of them
2. This is mainly for research, we will not overclock. Also we prefer Intel core
3. Currently, we will use 2-way SLI, and prefer to have potentials to extend to 4-way SLI

We will need your advice on
1. since we have two titan xp, do we need to build other cooling system other than the CPU cooling?
2. is there anything we need to tweak to avoid any bottleneck in the computer
3. if we purchase everything online, how hard will it be to build from scratch by ourselves?

When I open the dataset, I see the pictures, a read me, and mat files. In the read me, the author explains the .mat file contents. But when I open the files, the files essentially contain matrices. What I don't understand is how do these files translate to words? Like there is a file with different garment styles, but all it has is numbers (I presume category).

Single File Link where author explains that there are 1352 ""Bags of Words"": https://expirebox.com/download/f4c3089390dc2cef53e08b8ee36a12d8.html

I apologize in advance if this question sounds stupid. But any help here would do wonder to my confidence.",1,0,False,self,,,,,
