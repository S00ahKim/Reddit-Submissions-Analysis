Is there a way I can use to identify which neuron in my hidden layer is having a bigger impact on a specific region of an input image?

My input image is converted to an array and I want to know the pixel distribution per each neuron, i.e. making some kind of sorting of the connection with largest weight, associating the pixel to the neuron which it shares the ""best"" connection with.

I decided I wanted to try and classify motorcycles vs cars.   I trained a model with 700+ images and according to my test images I'm getting over 0.98 recognition.   I'm really happy with this.

The next thing I want to try is to hook up a web cam in my car to acquire real live imagery and try to detect cars/bikes in my blind spots while driving.  

So eventually I'll have tons of webcam stills.   I know I could take them all and batch retrain my model.    But is there an easier or built in way to incrementally train?   If I throw a novel image at the model and it labels as ""bike"" 0.99, is there a way to acknowledge it is correct and update the model live?   Or is the best way to just mark and save that image and do it by batch offline?

Using queues works fine for the optimizers in tensorflow, since they only evaluate the gradient once for each dequeue operation. However, I have implemented interfaces with other optimizers that perform line searches, and I need to evaluate not just the gradient, but also the loss at multiple points for the same batch. Unfortunately, with the normal queueing system each loss evaluation will execute a dequeue instead of computing for the same batch several times.

Is there a way to decouple the dequeuing operation from the gradient/loss computation in such a way that I can execute dequeue once and then execute the gradient/loss computation several times on the current batch?

Edit: Please note that my input tensors have variable length. We work with molecular data and each molecule has a different number of atoms. This is different from image data, where images are typically all scaled to a fixed size. So, for example, I think that using a tf.Variable assignment will not work because tf.Variable must have a fixed size.",1,1

**Apologies if this appears stupid**

I have been studying ML and Statistics concepts since a month and it would be helpful if someone could guide me.

While doing an regression, we have multiple tests like ANOVA, p-val, F/T - tests etc. 
Are they applicable while using tensorflow - or is it because you are using a deep learning neural network, it is not necessary?
In the example on tensorflow.org, while an SGD is run, there are no tests performed. Does a learning NN take care of it, or do we need to run them. 

If we have to run them, is there some example where I can relate.

TL;DR - I am trying to understand whether we need to run diagnostics when using TF and are the applicable - if so how.

Edit1 - Does training take care of not needing to run diagnostic tests?
