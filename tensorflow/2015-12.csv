2,2015-12-12,2015,12,12,5,3wf85q,Could someone explain the logicality of these artificial intelligent algorithms the closest possible to standard programming?,https://www.reddit.com/r/tensorflow/comments/3wf85q/could_someone_explain_the_logicality_of_these/,kafeaccount,1449865343,"( *I'm an experienced programmer, from Java to PHP, nodejs to ruby, c++ to # and I also have done a lot of work with system administration and amateurish electronics.* )

(but) I can't understand the first and deepest layers of these algorithms. I just can't do. 

1.  Could I **rudely** compare *tensorflow* to an optimization of *traditional algorithm* (searching similar images by comparing files, searching pattern *x* in a database, etc.) barely as jquery is to javascript? (just a library?)

2. What exactly constitutes the layers of automation, superficial middle and deep? Traditional code? OOP or nOOP? How does it adapt so inteligentelly to different situations? Because of *1*? Is it closer to being just a complicated function ""compareImages()"" which is just really well developed and engineered?
3. Is there any **heavy-tech and demonstrative** docs I could check to understands how tensorflow works? I have gone through the website information but didn't get that much of an intelectual applaud (please do understand I don't seek an analogy to rael life about this processing, be heavily techy on me or else I won't fully understand it)

Any help regarding this would be highly appreciated :) thank you!",5,5

My question being: what exactly is a device that gets *reset whenever operation fails*, *passing data through devices*, (etc). **Is a device a computer/node/processing unit?** Why can't TF operate solely on one device? What makes it essential for the algorithm?",0,3
