If I could get some clarifications, that would be great.

I want to use the Estimator API, and let's say that I have raw data in a .csv file with ints, floats, and strings. It seems like the Dataset allows you to map a csv row into a feature, either as a tensor directly or as a feature_column, which is later converted into a tensor. At this stage, I can only perform tf operations on the string data, making more sophisticated string preprocessing difficult. Some things that would be nice are incorporating NER tagging or POS tagging from SpacyNLP for instance.

Is this just the wrong place to do any preprocessing? I can imagine it's not so hard to vectorize / preprocess in pure Python before reading it with the Dataset API, but this won't leverage TensorFlow. I'd appreciate any help! Thanks",2,1

Ideally my model exposes the following interface:

```
class MyModel:
    def fit(self, x):
        pass
    def transform(self, x):
        pass
```
Pretty straight forward. The problems come while using tf.data.Dataset.

tf.data.Dataset reads data from a variety of sources and produces Tensors as outputs. These Tensors can then be multiplied, added, etc. to the other Tensors composing your computation graph. The problem is that this couples the Tensors produced by your Dataset in your computation graph. This breaks this object-oriented interface because ideally I would like to call the fit and transform methods on different Datasets without having to construct a new computation graph every time.

Does some one have any solution to this issue?",0,1

I am doing hand gesture recognition based of EMG Data that I aquired. I set the sequence length to 40 frames, recorded some gestures, labeld the sequence according to the gesture performed. I then proceeded to train a simple LSTM Recurrent Neural Network, and I am able to do predictions quite well. However, my prediction data so far has been other 40 frame long prerecorded gestures. 
Now I want to go ahead and do real time gesture recognition and I have one big question:

Do I need to take the whole last 40 frames and put it into my Network to do the prediction EVERY frame?

Because I thought, that now I could somehow throw the data of single frames sequentially into my Network, and at each timestep I could see how high the predictionvalues are...?

I am quite new to tensorflow and machine learning, so sorry if this is a stupid question.

I noticed that a large chunk of time was being spent reading texture data when retrieving the prediction results. As Mobilenet produces probability outputs for 1000 classes and I'm only interested in a few of those I thought it would be a good idea to add a filter layer to the model that simply gathers the outputs I care about and only returns those as output. I thought this would all happen on the GPU and therefore be far faster.

It turns out that this makes no discernible difference AFAICT. Is this a quirk of the WebGL implementation of Tensorflow.js or is my thinking just wrong for Tensorflow on all platforms? Please clue me up!",0,2

\-

\-

\-

So i have been studying alot of things in reinfocrement learning and came to an conclusion that i wanna try the ddpg algorithm. i tried code from; [https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/9\_Deep\_Deterministic\_Policy\_Gradient\_DDPG/DDPG\_update2.py](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/9_Deep_Deterministic_Policy_Gradient_DDPG/DDPG_update2.py) but when using this code i had directly a million questions... i tried running it first to see if it works fine and uit worked good enough with the pendeluem example environment, but then i realized that i couldn't get my environment hooked up/working with this existing code!?.

\-

\-

\-

My environment consists atleast of reset, action and init function. the reset function should\* return pictures in 1080x720 pixels in what i believe a rgb array...? my action function consists of needing an environment and choosing based on the q values an action, i understand i will need to update that to something more suiteable for this algorithm. the actions are ""up"" ""down"" ""right"" . when for example up is called it will call a function that does his job... it is not so relevant on what the actions do (?). and in my init function i do some init things, but not really anything related to the ddpg algorithm. this environment file is first been used for normal q-learning i understand there needs to be things changed, but i don't get how/where..

\-

\-

\-

init looks like:

        def __init__(self):
            super(Environment, self).__init__()
            self.action_space = ['up', 'down', 'right']
            self.n_actions = len(self.action_space)
    #        self.n_features = 3 #this is i think needed for ddpg, don't know wich value it should be also

\-

\-

\-

Thats around everything i have in my environment... if i need more in my environment just let me know...

i know that my environment is continious states/actions and that i then need ""box"" environment to be created, but then again i have no idea how to set this up with this ddpg code i currently have.

\-

\-

\-

End goal:

\-

\-

\-

1: The AI should be build properly and should have all the ddpg aspects in his algorithm

2: The AI is attached to the environment, input as images and actions as 0, 1, 2 (0=up,1=down,2=down)

3: The AI should save his progress somewhere (like a pickle)

\-

\-

\-

At last: i can't share my environment code with you, but it doens't has anything strange in it, just a reset and step function , with reset (should\*) returning a picture. and step having the actions 0,1,2 in it, i know there should be something switched that the actions aren't chosen in step but in the algo but atleast from step it should return the action chosen right?

\-

\-

\-

Should\* : i have pictures that are timeframes from the game, there .png and are 1080x720 (will change later size) i want the ai to get so see the pictures i don't have any good ways yet to feed the pictures to the environment, but i think i've read something about array's and rgb modes?

\-

\-

\-

If you know anything about let me know on things that may help (please don't just post only links to documentations, i've read them all, explaining is allowed?), if you know all/some answers please let me know, if you could send some example code with it aswell, so i can understand it? if you really wanna help me out with live chat we can skype/discord, just send a pm with your discord/skype name so we can talk about it?

If you already know this you can skip to end of refresher

If we take a tf operation like matmul and give 2 tensors as arguments tensorflow will treat these arguments as matrices and multiply them giving a result as a tensor (i used matrix of (1,1) shape to make it easier to multiply)

`mat_a = [[3]]`

`mat_b = [[4]]`

`tf.matmul(mat_a, mat_b) = [[12]]` 

you can easily chain this operation feeding the resulting tensor into another matmul.

However if you feed a list of tensors into a matmul it will treat each element of the list as a matrix and multiply it by each element of the second list. Which is extremely useful way to multiply multiple matrices at the same time

`list_a = [mat_a, mat_b, mat_c]`

`list_b = [mat_x, mat_z, mat_y]`

`tf.matmul(list_a, list_b)  = mat_a*mat_x, mat_b*mat_z, mat_c*mat_y`

Alas the result of this operation is not a list of tensors but a tensor that contains all the tensors. 

If a tensor is fed into the matmul it is treated as a matrix not as a list so this operation cannot be easily chained.

End of refresher

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am trying to execute tf operations that take a list argument in succession.

Because the result of the tensorflow operations are tensors and not lists you cannot simply feed the resulting tensor into the next operation.

I have found a very useful function  [tf.create\_partitioned\_variables](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/create_partitioned_variables)  which returns a list from a tensor.

The only problem is that you need to know the shape of the tensor beforehand which is impossible when feeding a dictionary into a model

Using tf.reshape to make sure the shape is right beforehand will still end up throwing an error.

What is a proper way of chaining such operations?",1,1

I'm feeling pretty stupid already. The install instructions stated the installation would only need a single pip3 command. Somehow that is too much for me to do right.

Now, I am trying to transition from shallow learning to a Deep Q network in Tensorflow, but have an issue getting started with it.

What I really would like, is an extremely simple reward based script, which can train itself over time based on simple tabular data, with a finite amount of actions to take and predefined rewards for each action on each sample.

Ideally, the sample format could be the following:
feature1, feature2, feature3, feature4, feature5, feature6
42, 1, 0.43, 0, 1, 57.59
11, 1, 2.09, 1, 0, 112.00

Then the actions/rewards could be defined in a separate CSV like this:
reward for action1, reward for action2, reward for action3
50, 0, -100
-30, -10, 20

Meaning if the RL algorithm takes action1 on sample1, it would gain a reward of +50, and if it takes action2 on sample2 it would suffer a -10 penalty.

Now, in shallow learning and with Scikit Learning, this is perhaps one of the simplest way to train an algorithm (perhaps with a few adjustments, as a Deep Q isnt available in shallow learning, to accommodate shallow learning algorithms like Logistic Regression etc.). So I assume there must be a super simple way to train a Reinforcement Learning or other Deep Q Learning algorithm like that in Tensorflow, but I seem unable to find any examples.

Any help would be much appreciated - even if its just a link to some example I might have missed on Google. :)

I've looked all over, it seems like it is something that would be quite common to me so I'm confused as to why I can't find anything about it",7,5

I've seen them used multiple times as images in presentations or blogs but I can't find an option to download them and after some googling I didn't find anything. I know I can download the csv or json with the values ploted, but given that tensorboard already plots it it'd be nice to simply download it as an image.

Thanks in advance!!",5,3

im playing around with the object detection part of tensorflow and already successfully trained my first model to detect cars, so thats cool already. My plan is to detect and count cars in a webcam feed, but I noticed my results arent very pretty yet (multiple boxes around a car instead of one) and I suspect my training data isnt good enough.
I downloaded 110 images of cars via google image search, labeled them per hand and then split them up in 10 test images and 100 training images. But it seems the training doesnt want to go under 2% loss, so I guess I need more or better data. 
I assume im not the first person that wants to detect cars, and I wanna learn how to train it myself, so I dont wanna use a ready-to-use model... are there any places where I could download pre labeled training images of f.e. cars? If not, what should I take care of when labeling the images myself to get better results? simply ""more""? thanks for your time in advance

I have tried using transfer learning on my training dataset but didn't work well...tried changing hyperparameters too but no sign of improvement shown. Accuracy for all the epochs were exactly same and it seems the model is not training at all.

So I have thought of training a new model, a simplest CNN model with three convolutional layers with fully connected layers and pooling layers. 

I will train my model from scratch on my dataset

What should be my approach ?? Can anyone give me some suggestions ?? What model I can use to train from scratch ?? Anything good that I should know ?? ",14,1

Each image is 32MB when unsparsified.

I wish to use these as a training dataset in tensorflow(/keras).

They are too large to load completely into memory, so I would like batches of them loaded at a time. A batch of N images is randomly selected from the files on disk, then loaded, *some processing here*, fed into training session.

Does a solution for this already exist somewhere out there?",4,3
