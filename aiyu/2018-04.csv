2,2018-4-2,2018,4,2,2,88sezg,New to IU. Which album should I start with?,thatwaszen,1522603428,"IU has slowly crept into my world, first as a friend of In-na (bias) and then Hyori's B&amp;B and then Nayeon's (other bias) crush. Funny, I hadn't heard her sing much at all until very recently, just her playing guitar and singing on IG. Now I finally understand what the buzz is about. So I don't know which album to begin with? Pallette, her album of the year? Or should I start further back? Thanks for the help! 

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful comments. They all really helped to to give me a handle on a party that I seem to be very late to. Haha! I settled on Palette and Spring of Twenty Years to start. Funny, the first song I auditioned from Palette was Black Out, which, after about 30 seconds got me to buy the album. And this [live performance](https://youtu.be/lDwz2QpPaKQ) helped seal the deal. (I must have listened to that song a dozen times already, its so addictive.) Anyway, thanks again. And this sub has a new subscriber. :-) ",10,5

Personally, I love her short hair looks more than words can express *BUT* 

You just can't beat long hair for me. I think I was truly won over when I watched
Scarlet Heart because I'm a sucker for historic hairstyles and in my opinion
long hair and short hair are different kinds of beauty and I just love IU with
long to medium length hair.
