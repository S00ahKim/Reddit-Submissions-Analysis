Anyways, what was the moment you realized that, Hey, this is pretty good! for IU? 


For me, it wasnt anything dramatic, I was listening to my usuals on YouTube when Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms came on, and I loved her voice ever since.

What about you? Share your thoughts below ",13,15

17,2018-6-10,2018,6,10,13,8pymp5,"Would you rather: IU sing only fast paced/funky type of music like 23, Zeze ,Last night story and Good Day or IU sing only slow paced/emotional type of music like the The Shower, Heart, Knee and Raindrop?",HopeIUGlory,1528606028,"I have recently asked about what is everyone favourite chatshire album's music and after reading the comments. I began to wonder what is the IU that I would choose if she can only sing either fast paced or slow paced. What if somehow we lived in a parallel world where only one side of IU's music exist. What would be your decision? You have to choose one side and give your reason as to your decision. This is a tough one. I will start by saying I choose the emotional/slow paced type music because the first IU song I ever heard or made a huge impact on me was ""Heart"". While I love her fast paced tracks, but the slow paced songs usually stuck with me the longest and I remember how there was a period of time where I replay knee, raindrop and dear name for weeks and months. Her voice also have that tinge of fragility that makes it very suitable for emiting emotion through music.",11,6

In all honesty, I would probably be dumbfounded and have trouble getting my words out :)",16,19

31,2018-6-20,2018,6,20,23,8sisds,Favourite scene in My Mister? Although there was many but I would say that the scene where she found out dong hoon went to the loan shark place so that he can beat the guy up and she heard it all through the bug. Second would be when dong hoon found Ji An injured in the shack. ,HopeIUGlory,1529505354,,5,33
