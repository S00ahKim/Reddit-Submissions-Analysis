(i know its 3 years old)",whatitsjk,1451830764,"I follow KPOP but only songs and i dont look up Kpop news often or their personal lives (i find it to be to much time since its mostly in a different language)

However, just recently, I learned about IU and Eunhyuk bed scandal thing and how somepeople even said that she did hint it clearly that yes they did sleep together (going by what he is saying on [here](http://kpopranter.blogspot.com/2013/07/iu-finally-addresses-eunhyuk-scandal.html))

but that article is also 3 years old. now after all that happened, did anyone get it cleared up?

I also just found out today she is dating someone and has been since 2013 :(
