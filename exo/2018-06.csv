51,2018-6-9,2018,6,9,13,8pqfpr,r/EXO Information on South Korea's new Military Enlistment Rules,99101004,1528518806,"Hi friends! The mods put together a small quick hit about what is going on and what we generally know about the new military requirements in South Korea. We will continue to update this as more information is released, feel free to discuss in the comments below or update us on other information you may have found\~

# NEW ENLISTMENT RULES IN KOREA

Males in Korea ages 18\-35 are required to enlist for about 2 years in the military. The social stigma is that males should enlist by age 30.

**28\+ International Age (Includes Xiumin):** Cannot delay enlistment for any reason  
**25\-27 International Age (Includes the majority of EXO):** Can delay through overseas travel (6 months at a time, up to 5 times in one year, the total time length of these permits cannot exceed 2 years)  
**KEEP IN MIND:** This doesnt change WHEN people have to enlist directly. But it does make it harder for people to postpone enlistment.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EXO:** Before these new regulations took place, idols were able to travel freely without restrictions. With these new regulations idols will not be able to travel overseas/have as many schedules outside of Korea as they once did. As listed above, they can only leave Korea 5 times in a year, making it hard for idols to do promotions and concerts internationally.

**WHAT ABOUT XIUMIN?** Xiumin was able to delay being enlisted into the army by going to school and working toward obtaining a PhD. Through these new rules, any male Korean citizen will not be able to delay this process by going to university and obtaining a PhD. As of right now, we are unsure of how soon he will need to enlist and will not tolerate any spreading of rumours about what is happening until SM gives us confirmation.

**WHAT ABOUT LAY?** Lay will not be affected by any of this since he is EXOs only Chinese member and is not required to complete military service.

**FOR NOW....** These new regulations have already been put into effect on the 29th of May of this year (2018). As always we will not tolerate any hate towards former or current members. We will not allow any false or malicious rumours to spread, so please refrain from posting fake rumours until SM officially releases a statement regarding their idols and enlistment dates.",24,49

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #167! 

Stop what youre doing and stream Kris new MV for [Tian Di](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1Zk8MJUPE&amp;feature=youtu.be)- personally this might be one of my favorite releases from him ever! And he is looking mighty fine in that video~ To help you cool off from those visuals, heres a video of Chanyeol [drenching himself in ice water](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj3gCyeHBs0/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=real__pcy) to show support for Koreas first hospital dedicated to treating Lou Gehrigs Disease. The Ice Bucket Challenge has been making a comeback amongst idols because of this hospital, and I hope they receive a lot of support in the wonderful work that theyre doing.

I AM SINCERELY SORRY FOR NOT MENTIONING THIS LAST WEEK BUT BAEKHYUN [NOW HAS A TWITTER](https://twitter.com/B_hundred_Hyun/status/1005254328829919232) jESUS my apologies for the late reminder, I just figured that every EXO-L had imploded by now from the very concept. 

As always, catch up with the recent happenings with the latest [ICYMI thread](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002946343118110721)!

I mean like, not just title tracks, but from concerts or other performances too, even CBX or Solo songs. I feel like if you immediately asked me what my favourite choreo was I would question what you meant, like do you want me to pick one that I am most impressed with... One I would show my friends who don't listen to exo? or like, the one I just all around enjoy the most? They are both very different. 

I think if I had to narrow it down: 

* **One I am the most impressed with:** [Electric Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcdLVKYsHHU) &amp; [Blooming Days](https://youtu.be/UdjEoGzXxmI) (CBX \- mainly because they also sing it live every time as well)
* **One I enjoy watching the most:** [The One](https://youtu.be/mSMz_uRYRwo) (CBX) &amp; [White Noise](https://youtu.be/aQV7hfHxIco) ..... ok and maybe also [One &amp; Only](https://youtu.be/pfHuoL_aQI8)

So tell me, what are your favourite? Is it a personal fave in terms of you enjoy watching it the most, or is it one your most impressed with? Link some videos if you can for new fans who may have never seen yet\~",20,31

EXO has been extremely hard at work for us, we should all cool off by watching their [Nature Republic CF](https://youtu.be/tl1rCpiQvvk). We could not have seen this coming.... maybe ever..........
If that doesn't help cool you off maybe you can look at Baekhyun relaxing on the [beautiful island of Jeju](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkMFfCLgc22/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo)!


Our CBX boys and our dear Yoona were also chosen as the 'Honorary Ambassador's of Safety' by the City Government of Seoul and we could not be any more prouder than we are of our boys. 



To spice up this weeks Casual Convo, let's throw in a discussion question?

**If EXO could collab with any group or artist, who would you like it to be?**


If you don't know me, you should know I absolutely love and adore SHINee. It certainly helps when both of my groups love each other dearly as well~

Both groups are very much fans of the other - they have [danced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogu-8XjPOO0&amp;ab_channel=SBSEntertainment) to each others songs before, and let us certainly not forget [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQewn5Rgwx8&amp;ab_channel=TsaiMinya) absolute beauty. Taemin and Kai have sang together with Taemin's song ['Pretty Boy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fKhWic1yg&amp;ab_channel=MnetOfficial) and we are all still waiting for more.

I'd also *love* to see a collab between Key, Boa and Xiumin. Please SM make it so!

192,2018-6-28,2018,6,28,5,8ucyh3,What's a song you didn't like at first but then grew to love?,Xaille,1530130514,"There's always that one song that pops into my mind that still blows me away today, and that's: 

**El Dorado**

When I came back into Kpop, it was during Monster/Lucky One era, so after listening to the Ex'Act album, I went on and looked through more of EXO's discography. I remember the first time I heard El Dorado. I was driving to work around 8 in the morning and I was almost there, I had EXO's discography on shuffle, when all of a sudden I started paying attention to the lyrics some more... *""They're singing about El Dorado? Why are they singing about El Dorado...Sail... sail... sail?? This is weird.""* (My first instinct pictures 'The Road to El Dorado' movie, so my confusion got even more far out there...) I thought it was weird and skipped it (*BIG MISTAKE*). 

Then heard it again another time while I had EXO Youtube videos on shuffle at work (I'm a great employee) and heard Baekhyun's vocals. I was floored. I couldn't believe what I was listening to. My ears were in heaven, who's voice was that? I quickly switched to the Youtube tab and saw Baekhyun belting out that note and I was instantly in love (this may or may not have solidified my biasing Baekhyun...) In that moment I was like *""wtf why did I ever skip this?""* and replayed the video. 

Sometimes it takes more than one listen for me to truly realize how great (or bad) of a song it may truly be. If I think a song is ""bad"" now, I'll give it one or two more listens to really decide if that's how I feel or not. 

What's a song you've come to love? I'm really interested in how you've found out that you actually really love whatever song it may be! When was your *""wtf I'm crazy for skipping this!""* moment?

Just your friendly neighborhood mod stopping by to let you know about EXOcord's (our discord server) weekly group watch\~ Every Friday @ 10PM EST we gather on [Rabb.it](https://www.rabb.it/quatchi) to watch things we may have missed from the week (example: Subbed Episodes of CBX's Reality Show) + one other larger thing, like a movie or a concert. 

# Tonight starting at [10PM EST](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) we will be watching: 

# - Episodes 21-26 of CBX's Reality Show 

# - Episodes 26-29 of Chanyeol's Reality Show, Salty Tour 

*Note about Salty Tour: Chanyeol only appears on the show starting on EP 26, so you do not need to have seen prior episodes to know what is happening.* 

You definitely don't have to be there right at the beginning, you can join in at any time! Everyone is super friendly and these events are amazing for new fans, or people who want to interact more with other fans. We tend to go off schedule a lot of watch lots of fun things as we go. 

Hope to see you there!",1,8
