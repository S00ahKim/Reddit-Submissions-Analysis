The trial started today and will be live-streamed today and on March 8. However, the defendants (who didnt appear in court) argued their actions were partially due to their poor background. In response, Yixing asked that their fine be lowered from $50k USD to $10k USD. A lot of people are upset and saying hes too nice, but I think its also partly a strategic move.

Don't just think about your favorite song, but also think about what kind of songs would fit him. Let's be honest, he can literally pull off any genre, but think hard, what song do you think he could do the BEST at? 

Personally, would love to hear him cover (and this might be recency bias since the song came out a couple days ago) [**Lovedrunk by Epik High**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Vz-ptyKbQ)! I think his voice would be so good with the rapping in this. The robustness of Chen's voice able to go very high and so soft would be perfect for this song. He has so much life in his voice and the riffs he would add in would be absolutely amazing.

Let me know what you guys think!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Q: The photoshoot started in the afternoon. What did you do before getting to the venue?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Because I got up too early, I went to play basketball, had lunch, and even went to an oriental clinic, which was quite diligent of me.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then the swelling (tn: that youd have after waking up in the morning) must have disappeared by now? (laugh)**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Ive been starting a new diet that matches my body. I usually would eat meat but they said it wasnt right for my type of body (tn: probably metabolism). They said that I should plan my diet primarily based on seafood and white rice now. Ive been eating carbs, which I wouldnt usually eat before, so my body is a bit swollen.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: In one of your previous interviews, you said that one of your mottos is to be present at the moment. What side of yourself do you want to present in todays interview?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I need to be present at the moment but I probably worked out too hard in the morning, my eyes cant be all shiny now (laugh). But fortunately I think my current state matches the concept of todays photoshoot too, so I guess it did my body some good relaxing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You recently attended Bvlgaris B.zero1 20th anniversary event in Rome as Koreas representative.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: It doesnt happen everyday that you are invited to attend an overseas event. So it was an experience full of amazement and fun for me. It was also the first time I ever went to Italy so I took the opportunity to enjoy Rome to the fullest before coming back (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youre also known as one of the humorous members within your team. I feel like I know what that means now.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I havent even started though? Im talking in all seriousness right now (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you normally wear jewelry too?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I have great interest in fashion, but I wasnt that acquainted with jewelry. There was one time when I accidentally had a scratch on my neck during a dance session, so I became more careful after that. But then thanks to this event, I got to wear rings and necklace(s), and they seemed to look nice on me. Hahaha  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Yeah I watched that live broadcast where you showed your ring too (laugh).**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: It kinda matched the look that I went for that day so I wanted to brag a little bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You did some travelling with your friend after finishing the schedule, normally its not easy for you to travel around, isnt it?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I do travel once in a while. Ive been planning my vacations ever since the 4th year after my debut. I personally love travelling, so I took the time to form a group with my friends and travel every year. But still, this was the first proper Europe trip with a friend.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Not only Rome, you took your time to travel every corner of Venice too. Whats your travelling type?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I wasnt the type who would plan my itinerary so thoroughly in the past. That resulted in me belatedly knowing that the place I just came back from was a very famous place, or there was a god restaurant near my hotel that I passed by without knowing. It was kinda upsetting and such a pity. (Because) When would I ever get the chance to visit that city again. Its really true that you only feel and see as much as you know. That was when I started to plan my travels and do my research diligently before going somewhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Where was the most memorable place from this trip?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: My favorite spot was Colosseum. We unintentionally went there 3 times, but if it makes you go Wow\~ looking from the outside, once you get inside, it gives you this unexplainable vibe. I didnt have my expectations high but once I was inside, the scenes from the movies , , the series came to mind one by one and matched with what I saw, so it was a very interesting experience. It felt so incredible, the fact that thousands of people from the B.C times would come to this huge building, sit here and cheer as they watched the matches.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats your next destination?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Im thinking Paris. Ive been there once but I just travelled around without a guide, so its a shame that I couldnt feel much. This time I plan to go on a guided tour and also visit the nearby city where Van Gogh, my favorite artist, used to live before he passed away. And to view his artworks too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You put Su-hwak-haeng in your instagram profile. Whats your trivial happiness these days? (tn: su-hwak-haeng is a wordplay with so-hwak-haeng, which stands for the guaranteed happiness that comes from small/trivial things)**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think I just feel happy after having a day a little well-spent. When I lie on my bed before sleep, watching Netflix, after spending time well. That really is the moment of happiness, isnt it? (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats Suhos typical well-spent day like?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I do a lot of sports, including fitness. Also for my lyrics composing, whenever I come up with something, I write it down. I meet my friends, we watch movies and share our stories, too. Or if theres someone in the group with an audition coming up, we would help him with script reading too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Throughout the interview, I kept thinking that you reminded me of someone, then I realized that your voice or your vibe really resembles your close friend, Byun Yohans. Do you grow to be alike as much as you are close?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: My brother said the same thing too A few people said something similar too. Is it because I do script readings with him frequently (laugh)? But as you get to know us, we always have big differences.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Is there something youre into these days?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: These days its basketball. My goal is to work hard and level up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats at the center of Suhos life at the moment? Have you ever thought about that?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I have my personal ambition regarding acting so Ive been participating in musical and movie works, but the fact that Im EXOs Suho before anything else doesnt change. Also during this Italy trip, I got recognized by many people, I think it was because Im EXO Suho, and the invitation that I got to attend an event overseas was also thanks to my EXO title. Thats why its only natural that I always keep EXO at my center.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: We all know that you call yourself the funniest member in EXO. How would you define your gag code?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Our fans call it the gag pristine area. That its the kind of gag where I dont devalue and hurt any certain person, but only make fun of myself. I personally thins such a innocently funny thing. In itself, its a kind of heavens-helped gag (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you know that the very fact that you are explaining it right now is funny too?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sometimes there are people like that too. They say that whatever I do is just funny. When we did the photoshoot sometime ago too, it seems I was quite interesting. The photographer said that I was interesting even when I just stood still.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Arent you proud of yourself at times like that?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Of course Im happy (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Who has the best understanding of this gag dimension of yours?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sehunnie really likes it. Our codes really match well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then whos the most incompatible member?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its Chanyeol. Chen used to not match either but now hes come to understand my code (laugh). But Chanyeolie seems to never get it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I think its not an overstatement to say that the relationships among EXO members now are like a family. When are the times when you are reminded oh so well that As expected, we are one team.?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Recently we got the chance to gather all the members after 2 weeks. It was such a happy and interesting time. Of course we ended up playing games that time too, and I dont know why but I ended up last place.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Was it because the members kept tackling you?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think eventualy its because I take it well. And my reaction is good too. You know there are also people who pull a stern face and hate it when you joke around. But as for me, I dont act like that as long as it doesnt go too far. I think they tend to especially act like that more because they want to see my reaction  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Dont you ever think I want to get down from the leader position now?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont know if its because of the years weve been working, but now be it the members or the company, they always come to discuss with me first. But these days Ive been thinking, that even if I werent the leader, they wouldve done that same. Its tiring at times, but at the same time its rewarding too, that So Ive lived a good life. I dont think the situation would change much even if I were to retreat from the leader position now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If theres something you wish from the members as the leader?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: We play games a lot, but I wish they started to learn how to lose now. You know people say losing is actually winning. To be honest, there were many times when I intentionally lost. More that feeling happy from winning in a game, I would hate it more to see the members who have strong desire for winning being upset from losing. Rather than I need to win even if I have to die, it feels more at ease to just let others win (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I guess its the leaders consideration.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its just my personality. Ive been like that ever since I was small. Even when we played games where we bet a jjajjangmyeon, my friends would fight and end up injuring themselves. So I never joined (such games).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whos the EXO member with a particularly strong desire for winning?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Its Chanyeol (laugh). As for me and Kyungsoo, we have no desire to win, nor are we interested. Anyways, my hope is that they would learn the happiness when you lose intentionally for others sake. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Just 1 year after you challenged yourself in the musical field with in 2017, you ascended to star in . You even won yourself many newcomer awards. It must mean that you got your recognition now, right?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think to some people, Im forever an acting idol who came from an idol group. Thats all the more reason I feel thankful being awarded. Because it means that I got recognized a little as a musical actor. I know very well that with every award comes the responsibility and pressure, so I need to work even harder in the future. Because Im a new actor who just starts now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youd hinted a few times that you wanted to work with seniors. Now that it finally came true, what did you learn from them personally?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Ive learned so many things. Jung Sunah nuna especially pointed things out and helped me meticulously. She would make precise comments like You was slower than the beat in here. Even in the middle of the actual show too (laugh). I learned a lot from observing how the seniors did it, and all the process of working together together with them became such great energy to me. I was able to learn from watching carefully every move of Park Hyoshin hyung as he did it. Haha. I think I worked hard to try to catch up through that process of watching them for reference, then reinterpreting it in my own way.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: 2018 was a year that you worked hard not only in EXOs activities but also as an individual. What kind of plan do you have for this year?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: So far theres no exactly finalized plan. Its just that I really want to work on a movie or a drama, and a musical is a good idea too. EXO also has plans to show various sides of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If you could choose, what kind of face would you want to meet the viewers with?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont particularly look for a certain character. But I do hope that its not one that is too stiff. I want to act someone whos flexible, mischievious, and shows their emotions well. But I dont want it to be another cool character again. Because its kinda burdensome. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats the picture that Suhos visualizing for the future to come?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I want to become someone of positive influence, who sets a precedent. So that I can become a senior who starts and paves the way for my junior colleagues, and is of help to them. For instance I can be of positive influence to my fans or others just by donating or making a volunteer organization. Also, if in the past, when you say you want to be awarded at Cannes or the Oscars, it would be common for people to tell you to stop dreaming, but now, that thought is gradually becoming something realizable, not a dream without any hope. I believe that someday a Korean will make it. And the junior actors who see that will be able to dream bigger dreams.

To our eldest member in EXO who looks like he just turned 19! Our trending fairy, sold out fairy\~I hope our precious man spends his birthday surrounded by everyone he loves!



Lets get into it! In case you need a reminder of the power he holds, here is a confident man who wears [10k](https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006HnQKyly1fne6cp00e0j30qo140do5.jpg) jackets while performing, [yeah he runs this show](https://streamable.com/4mqmb).

&amp;#x200B;

Our Minseok opened his very own [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/e_xiu_o/) (and sorry every other exo member) HE WON. Despite forgetting his password every other week he posts the [BEST](https://www.instagram.com/e_xiu_o/) pictures ever recorded on this very earth. [This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403707315439796224/559883060137558019/DmqACbjUUAEg_Oa.jpg) was his first ever picture posted (now deleted unfortunately)

&amp;#x200B;

For CBXs Japanese album Magic released in May, Xiumins solo [Shake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY3dUUQdFOU) literally shook me (I am so sorry I had to).

His very own song Beyond was revealed during Elyxion, and SM posted a great video for their [BEATBURGER PROJECT X XIUMIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4E4PmHGD0c).

CBX's Blooming Days era was also a personal favourite to many Elsa's for the reasons like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK45XM7v8v8), and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403707315439796224/559892480661913611/x19.gif). His vocals were beyond amazing, his dancing looked better than ever (he is a main dancer!!!!!!!) and he started to open up so much more on variety shows. Try not to fall in love with him I DARE YOU!

&amp;#x200B;

Minseok is the very PURE definition of successful fanboy, look at all these posts:

[Changmin](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjzlGF0l-dt/) posted this photo on his Instagram, [TVXQ's](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjzjNoqHHNb/) Instagram posted this and [here is another one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjziYE0nwW3/) of him and Yunho!

He even went on '[I Live Alone](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btpfax7HbEn/)' with Changmin!

On top of being a successful fanboy, he is also a great supporter for his members, seeing Suho in both '[The Man Who Laughs](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1020257144824713216)' and '[The Last Kiss](https://66.media.tumblr.com/76e9b79615ec065f3fce02a8c60ab5e4/tumblr_p31cbhukOo1qhmxnlo1_640.jpg)' (to name a few instances)

&amp;#x200B;

When EXO decided to do a VLIVE for EXO-Ls after their DMUMT comeback, and he did most and the [CUTEST](https://66.media.tumblr.com/165a36d2e560c5457e9166d76c15b196/tumblr_plwnieNhJC1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg).

I would also just like to thank every deity for this look when he (and EXO) went on [Mugi-Box](https://66.media.tumblr.com/886aa6514b060e25a5a47795bac6e231/tumblr_plcl9e90xn1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) to promote 'Love Shot'.

&amp;#x200B;

To end it off, Xiumin released his very first episode of [Heart 4U](http://www.vlive.tv/video/119817)! 

This genuinely warms my heart because he is a very private person, and he allowed all of us to see what the inside of his house looks like and I will be forever grateful for it.

168,2019-3-27,2019,3,27,22,b64l6v,Your thoughts on Exo fanfics? :),RVKH,1553693852,"Hi guys! 

Im doing a college research project on Exo fanfics (comparing ones featuring heterosexual love to ones featuring a pairing within the group), and have noticed that gay exo fan fiction seems to have more mature writing (not in terms of smut but in terms of the writing quality and the subtlety of ideas/themes and descriptions). I was wondering if you guys could tell me which type of exo fan fiction you prefer and why (if youre able to pinpoint it) and if any of you guys get the same vibes as me about writing style differences or have different thoughts on differences between the two genres? Thanks so much ",20,14
