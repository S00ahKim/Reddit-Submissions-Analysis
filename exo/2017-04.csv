**Cytube Notes (from Jamie last week)- Please Read**

* Please note that our cytube is going through some changes, so you will need to make a few adjustments possibly when you arrive.
* You will see a small panel below the chat that will have Display Modes &amp; Themes. From there, change your theme to LIGHT or BOOTSTRAP, this will make the chat much more readable. If you check off the text that says Fluid it will make your chat + video player much bigger.
* If you are new to cytube, along the top there are a few different things to pick from, Select Options then go over to Chat and turn off Show timestamps in Chat. This will make the chat easier to follow as well.
You are now able to paste links into the chat and photo previews will appear! Wooo!

If you are one of those new subscribers, and wondering what the purpose of this post is, Casual Convo is for a general discussion on just about anything (EXO, Kpop, life).  It's also the place to post questions or neat EXO finds, or show of some of your fandom talent (when they don't warrant their own post)!  So if you're new, or if you have something you'd like to share - this is the place!

- I know tickets are randomly drawn at the hotel near the date. Are there any kind of benefits to getting the best ticket/closest seating, such as will premium package buyers receive closer tickets ? (Vs the deluxe, superior, or economy packages?) Or is it all random? 

-From experience does anyone feel the tickets will still be good placement for a venue of this size? Especially with the concert being special encore shows? The venue is enormous and I know global package tends to get better tickets than most but I'm concerned due to the encore shows and venue size. I know either way it will be a fun experience but I'm hoping to have a general idea.

Thank you for any tips and info! :)",6,10
