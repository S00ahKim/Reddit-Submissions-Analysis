Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #161! 
But MORE IMPORTANTLY,
## **[HAPPY BIRTHDAY](https://media.giphy.com/media/V2SHmN2Wrxphm/giphy.gif) [TAO!!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7b66dad374fb16325ad9b7b1962011c3/tumblr_inline_o2licxPXF61snj0ne_500.gif)**

This past year has been a big one for Tao, with everything from new music to a [wax figure](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/981005651257147392) that will be unveiled on his birthday. Will they get two cakes, one for each Tao?

He released the banging singles [Hater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se860tf5M_w) and [Beggar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XifpfhFR-Kk) this past year and performed both at [the YSL Beauty Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04TWoaEFqn4). Beggar (Remix) was the theme song for [Electric Daisy Carnival China 2018](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/986123128727257088). If thats not the statement of the century, [I dont know what is.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/6947a20c89cbadac7d6bf5fb79307f88/tumblr_inline_nkgxd2RQLW1t4nslm.gif) Hater was #1 on the [Fresh Asia music chart for 4 consecutive weeks](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/973047248706723841), the longest a song is allowed on the charts. [Legends only~](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2f4e0fb78a567a4c0d352d0a0ae0bdf6/tumblr_inline_oivf6l6f501s62ouj_500.gif) The [first show](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcCiVMnU8AI4jdd.jpg) for Taos [IS GOD](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/983919174241083393) Concert Tour [just wrapped up in Shanghai](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/985693729615790080) where he had the chance to perform [Beggar](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/990947009124159489) and many other songs. The [visuals](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcEPp9iWsAA8Hse.jpg) are enough to [heat up your laptops](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcCwcfcWsAAKMbA.jpg), and were looking forward to [more fancams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPQvAcB2I94) coming out! [Thank you](http://cdn58.picsart.com/168258797001202.gif) for working so hard on your music, we appreciate every song! 

In the world of television, Tao is the [Nations Producer/Main MC](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/975216351043248129) for the official Chinese spin-off of Produce 101. Its been garnering a lot of attention, so please try to tune in! The first episode aired April 21st and will continue for the next few months. Cant wait to see what awesome [performance advice](http://37.media.tumblr.com/244c2dbecb522c5cb89acb1197db0af3/tumblr_n4aewzkHwD1qi4jgto1_250.gif) Tao is able to gift the trainees. Street Dance of China just wrapped up a succesful season where Tao was a [team leader](https://twitter.com/SDC_Update/status/990140241078927360) for one of the 4 troupes of contestants. Whether dancing, singing, or all-around entertaining, Tao is intent on [showing all of his sides to us!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/3a72540450636cf6a0a96f95b4c0fba9/tumblr_inline_n4lsrty2QP1ql6qbh.gif) 


Outside of the music realm, Tao worked with the Kering Foundation to create a PSA about their [#ICouldHaveBeen](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbx9QNFHH5V/) project working towards eliminating violence against women worldwide. This is an incredibly important statement to make and I hope he knows how [proud his fans are.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/871d12d80a6ed8e5bf691c6f36862795/tumblr_ou6hx3FZ1W1r9f1l9o4_540.gif) He also was recently announced as the [YSL Beauty Music Ambassador](https://twitter.com/TrendingWeibo/status/984594344807141377). Taos drama [Negotiator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrx_4v63BJk) reached [1 billion views on Chinese platforms](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/961845528332914688). No biggie, not like [thats a ridiculously huge number or anything](https://78.media.tumblr.com/427531c62bbead56a81b0e097fc95903/tumblr_inline_nqit17Vsyh1s230lw_500.gif) Congratulations to the entire cast and crew!
Whether Tao was singing for us, dancing his heart out, mentoring young professionals, or making a [fool of himself on Instagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZgfGhziDBg), he made his last year *HIS* and EXO-L cannot wait to see what else he has up his sleeves for us!

What have your favorite moments with Tao been this year? Leave your birthday wishes for [our panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsJLLEwUYZM) below!

This year Baeks been busy with CBX in both Japan and Korea, Instagram, and you know, just [singing the national anthem for the IOC at the Olympics](https://twitter.com/do_a_hae/status/960462996911702016). No big deal or anything

Lets start with his instagram post from [last years birthday](https://twitter.com/my0nen0n1y/status/992590206145462272), a great example of his love of close up [deadly af](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaX6US1A8Cz/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo) selfies. We were also blessed with only the [CUTEST BABY BAEK PICTURE EVER](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYBOdxqAmYw/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo) and some A+ photoshopping [skills](https://www.instagram.com/p/BU_meVtAlgR/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo). Were so lucky that he trusts us enough to have a public instagram and I hope these blessings continue for a long time.

This past year was also THE year for CBX. It started with a Japan debut mini and [the greatest anthem to money ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNwYapPXNkw) and continued with 
[CBX stages for ElyXiOn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrduS5D_maw) shows and these last few months of a [first Korean comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib674A1yMtg) and [first full album in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sIaUu2igUY).

By the time youre reading this, we may know more about [Priv,](https://www.instagram.com/privenewyork/) the mysterious teasers that have been going on for a month for what looks like a clothing line designed by BBH. The instagram account keeps talking about a press release on May 6, so well have to wait just a tad bit longer to see more.
 
One of the big things on the horizon for Baek is participation in the [One K unification song](https://twitter.com/dyo_00/status/990758842148511744) to be released in August. 20 idols are contributing to the song which is meant to be a symbol of the unification of the peninsula. This is so, so exciting beyond the world of Kpop and just goes to show the power of music in tense situations and even in political unrest. What a proud moment to be an Erie.

Heres some of my favorite looks/performances from Baek this year - this [killer airport look](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jSRJDoaAlh8IGNRcn6KDf5WBfp_7xBed), this [Cloud 9 performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FMBCi7d1Eg&amp;t=1s) and last but not least, everyones favorite totally-not-stress-inducing performance, [The Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71mb092scrM&amp;ab_channel=CENTENARY). 

What about you? What were your favorite Baek moments from this year? Leave your birthday wishes below!

Last week was jam packed with two birthdays for Tao and Baekhyun and I can still feel myself coming down of the buzz of Taos new concerts and all the new fansite releases for Baekhyun!

Unfortunately as we enter into a new week, it is with a heavy heart that I share the news of Kai's father passing away from a chronic illness. Kai speaks the sun, stars and planets of his father who encouraged him to do dance and continue on with his dreams. Kai and his family have requested for the funeral and events to be remain private so the mods have decided that we will not be allowing any photos, videos or content in relation to these events out of respect for those who are mourning.

EXO-L, let's be strong this week for Kai, the other members and for CBX as their new Japanese album and concert drops this week. 

Let's love!",8,6

After two very successful birthday projects, one for [Xiumin (raised $405)](https://imgur.com/a/zKHG7) and one for [Sehun/Luhan (raised $440)](https://imgur.com/a/XOsel) we are back with our month of May birthday project for Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suho! 

**How it works:** For each EXO member we will be offering 3 different charities to choose from, and you will vote on which one you would like/have most interest in donating to. We want to offer different charities from across the world that showcase each members personalities (or powers!) as best as possible.

**How we collect:** We are using PayPal Pools in order to collect for these donations. A link will be posted for each PayPal pool for the different Birthday Projects. You can donate any amount (even $1 helps) at any time until the deadline date. Your name will not show on the feed, so don't worry about doxxing. If you are cautious about donating to us, we will post all receipts showing which charity we have donated to. We have chosen to use Paypal Pool to donate to since it is against PayPal's policy to profit from this system and they can shut down the account on there if it is used incorrectly. In the case that the money is used incorrectly, the pool will automatically be shut down and the money will be returned immediately. Please note, Unfortunately PayPal pools is not a tool that is available in ALL countries around the world, so if you would like to contribute and you are from one of these locations please send me a private message. 

*Note: Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suhos Birthday all fall under the same month therefore the donations will be collected as 1 project on behalf of ALL 3 members. The donation will be made on the last members birthday - This month being Suhos on May 22 @ 12am KST.*

###Charity of choice:

[**Free Korean Dogs**](https://www.freekoreandogs.org/)

* Korea / Canada / USA
* About FKD: Our goal is to end the Korean dog meat trade. Our international rescue and adoption program saves hundreds of dogs each year from the Korean dog meat trade. We also promote public awareness to create a cultural shift from cruelty to compassion for dogs in Korea. We are an international community of volunteers and animal welfare activists.
*  Our donation will go towards helping feed, vaccinate and bring over dogs who have been rescued from the meat trade in Korea. 

*Free Korean Dogs received the most votes, so we will be making the donation to them and hopefully be raising enough money to fully save, support and adopt a dog in Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suho's name.* 

**Deadline:** May 22 @ 12 AM KST 

**Donate Here:** &lt;https://paypal.me/pools/c/83TmwGLNrt&gt;",0,9

Lets give Suho all the love today and appreciate all hes done in the past year!

Suho is  of the best ship of the past 5 years - Suho x [Suhorang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soohorang_and_Bandabi) - and it goes all the way back to last June when he updated the EXO-L official website with this [glorious phone wallpaper](http://fy-exo.com/post/161412552127) and adorable message. The [Pyeongchang Olympics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbOceHCF_I2/?taken-by=pyeongchang2018) account and the [EXO account](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbO8xamFwGC/?taken-by=weareone.exo) on instagram have both been used to show how much Suho loves Suhorang and the [Olympics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfdGlg5FH6P/?taken-by=weareone.exo)

Suhos updates on the EXO-L website extend way [beyond just caring for our phones.](https://twitter.com/bunnymye0n/status/960462971590737921) 1 Day 1 Suho has kept EXO-Ls fed for a while with cute caring messages and beautiful selcas. Probably the biggest single contributor to his selca collection was [The Last Kiss](https://twitter.com/EXOXOXOID/status/969417484024475649), the [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl8VAc6e9ng) he starred in from December to March. He shined on the stage as [Prince Rudolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRKtaWudMA&amp;feature=youtu.be) for those 4 months and did so well that hes been cast in [another musical later this year](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/976668367120560128?s=21). Suho was thrilled with EXO-Ls support of his musical endeavors and reciprocated that love with [special gifts](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/969126586325729280) on his last performance.

Suhos acting and singing arent just in musicals. The drama [Rich Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtByCUDKKw) is airing currently on Wednesdays and Thursdays with Suho starring as [Lee Yoochan](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/989845177354174465), a genius programmer with no facial recognition. He had not one, but two song collabs with Jang Jae-in, [Dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHj0S8-hwQU) and [Do You Have a Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjHAA2rmK7I). 

As leader, Suho is at the forefront for any big EXO events and this year had so many opportunities for him to represent the group. When EXO became the first K-Pop group to receive commemorative medals, [Suho was there at the recognition ceremony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBk1qM8gbE&amp;ab_channel=%EB%A7%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%BC%EB%A6%ACMYDAILY) When EXO travelled to [Dubai](https://twitter.com/exo_schedules/status/953957995532161024) to watch Power as the first K-Pop song to be used in the Dubai Fountain Show, Suho reminded us how this win was for K-Pop, not just for EXO. EXO has won so many awards in 6 years, yet [Suhos acceptance speeches](https://youtu.be/b7RZcr_WO3Y?t=51) are still consistently humble, thankful, and appreciative towards other artists, EXO-Ls, and those who have inspired them. 


What were your favorite Suho moments this year? Were you a fan of his [airport looks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoU6absPm2ey-PQLWf7DcF0HCMDu4jVB), or maybe more fond of [Suitho](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UN_BFWpTefleN77QtwjMvViAaHp-AHtt) with [glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBwnfhPK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be)? Did you enjoy the [hip rolls of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDFFfuYO380) and love how [Suho looks at EXO-Ls?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlpQoJjA1vk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

He shined on the stage as [Prince Rudolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRKtaWudMA&amp;feature=youtu.be) for those 4 months and did so well that hes been cast in [another musical later this year](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/976668367120560128?s=21). Suho was thrilled with EXO-Ls support of his musical endeavors and reciprocated that love with [special gifts](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/969126586325729280) on his last performance.

Suhos acting and singing arent just in musicals. The drama [Rich Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtByCUDKKw) is airing currently on Wednesdays and Thursdays with Suho starring as [Lee Yoochan](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/989845177354174465), a genius programmer with no facial recognition. He had not one, but two song collabs with Jang Jae-in, [Dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHj0S8-hwQU) and [Do You Have a Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjHAA2rmK7I). 

As leader, Suho is at the forefront for any big EXO events and this year had so many opportunities for him to represent the group. When EXO became the first K-Pop group to receive commemorative medals, [Suho was there at the recognition ceremony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBk1qM8gbE&amp;ab_channel=%EB%A7%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%BC%EB%A6%ACMYDAILY) When EXO travelled to [Dubai](https://twitter.com/exo_schedules/status/953957995532161024) to watch Power as the first K-Pop song to be used in the Dubai Fountain Show, Suho reminded us how this win was for K-Pop, not just for EXO. EXO has won so many awards in 6 years, yet [Suhos acceptance speeches](https://youtu.be/b7RZcr_WO3Y?t=51) are still consistently humble, thankful, and appreciative towards other artists, EXO-Ls, and those who have inspired them. 


What were your favorite Suho moments this year? Were you a fan of his [airport looks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoU6absPm2ey-PQLWf7DcF0HCMDu4jVB), or maybe more fond of [Suitho](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UN_BFWpTefleN77QtwjMvViAaHp-AHtt) with [glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBwnfhPK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be)? Did you enjoy the [hip rolls of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDFFfuYO380) and love how [Suho looks at EXO-Ls?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlpQoJjA1vk&amp;feature=youtu.be) 

Hope everyone has an amazing week!

Before we begin, I want to thank everyone once again for aiding us for Tao, Baekhyun and Suho's birthday donations. It means a lot to /u/99101004 and I to see EXO-Ls join together for a meaningful birthday present~



I want to first congratulate Sehun on becoming [VOGUE's best-dressed man](https://www.vogue.com/article/louis-vuitton-resort-2019-exo-sehun-best-dressed-menswear) at the 2019 Louis Vuittons show for the second year in a row!

Our sweet Lu deer, although he was under the weather, still attended a [charity event](https://twitter.com/mybabydeer/status/1000589610047553536). We hope our sweet deer feels better after getting plenty of rest!

Baekhyun's [Lined Magazine](https://linedstore.com/) cover (the same one Kai was on a couple months earlier) is releasing in June and we are so happy to see him thrive with Priv.

We're all super amazed with Kris' release of ['Like That'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1HAMUAXzbs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=KrisWu) and topping charts worldwide, as expected of course. 

Also Tao's hard work on his concertIS GODand to the release of his song ['Misunderstand'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kacRVXiyK8&amp;ab_channel=PreciousZTaoBar2)~

 

What exciting things have you all done over the weekend and what plans do you have for this coming week?
