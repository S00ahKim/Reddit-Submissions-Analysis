I am looking for a copy of the old fic 180 degrees  - Kai/Luhan/D.O. - and am hoping someone has it saved..

Backstory- I used to have very limited internet access and so saved my favorite fics so I could read them without using up my library time. I just found a folder of them on an old thumb drive, but there was a problem.......part 2 of 180 degrees isn't there, only part 1 and part 3.

If anyone out there has part 2 saved, please dm me! Thank you!",5,3

The title is....
UN VILLAGE !

its so short but can u blame me? i did it in one day. and my head is pounding. but anyways, id love for ppl to take a few minutes to play this dumbass game that is completely useless !! yay! 

Ill be making a lot more EXO games in the future!!! Theyll be bad tho cause I have to pay money to get cool features lol 

tips:
- arrows to move, arrow + shift to sprint, space to interact, X to open menu
- check for interactive objects such as signs and docks (there arent much)
- try for different dialogue (again, there isnt much but i didnt spend all that time for nothing)
- check food on table once inside abode(ull see it)
- to exit chanbaek abode, interact w village thingy in bottom right corner


thats it. btw, just because its an exe file does not mean im tryna hack ur computer or something kskssksksks the game probably takes like 5 minutes or something to play lol PLEASE play it

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

**Play this weeks game --&gt; Growl Era**

Growl won this weeks vote by 43.2% since 43% of you don't want to have fun and do something like Wolf or Mama, haha!!! Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Growl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

A few notes beside our typical rules, I used the Gifs from the [2nd Growl video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUs-hBjU9w8) as most of the gifs from the 1st MV include a ton of flashing lights and I don't want that to be triggering for people who are sensitive to that. Also, I dislike that I feel that I have to say this but.... Please DON'T ***NOT*** pick a former member just because they are a former member of EXO. Growl is a massive era that these members were part of, and we should also celebrate the time that they were there, if you were around than and you think a former member owned the era, vote for them or post videos and things below to prove your point! If you weren't around and you don't know about the former members, be sure to take the time to notice them in these performances as they were just as fantastic as our current members.

Theres really no way I see this working, but I feel so bad for our EXO boys and pretty much everyone involved since they probably worked their asses off only for their own fans to be boycotting their hard work on twitter. I want to support this only because I love SHINee, EXO and NCT and they deserve better, but itll be hard since it seems unlikely that SM is going to succeed on this venture, everything from the name to the slogan and timing is so poorly strategized and Im sure Taemin and Baekhyun especially, whove worked really hard on their solo releases this year, are exhausted already. 

These are my thoughts",2,1

For title tracks, I really like Love Shot (partly just because of how attractive all the members are in all the perfs etc) and Overdose + Call Me Baby. I can't even choose anymore because they're all so good haha.

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

[**Round 1 Winners**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cna0um/game_time_which_member_owned_the_growl_era_round_1/)

This week we are looking at the **'Growl'** Era. Because this is Round 2, only the first 3 highlighted members below will move on.........

|Member|Finishing Position|Percentage Results|

Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Growl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Tuesday evening (EST),** I will post the winner of the Growl, as well as next weeks era (MAMA or Wolf, it will be great hehhh)\~ You can vote which era we will loot at next week in the vote below!
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

As mentioned in Round One:

&gt;*A few notes beside our typical rules, I used the Gifs from the* [*2nd Growl video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUs-hBjU9w8) *as most of the gifs from the 1st MV include a ton of flashing lights and I don't want that to be triggering for people who are sensitive to that. Also, I dislike that I feel that I have to say this but.... Please DON'T* ***NOT*** *pick a former member just because they are a former member of EXO. Growl is a massive era that these members were part of, and we should also celebrate the time that they were there, if you were around than and you think a former member owned the era, vote for them or post videos and things below to prove your point! If you weren't around and you don't know about the former members, be sure to take the time to notice them in these performances as they were just as fantastic as our current members.*

**Play this weeks game --&gt; Wolf Era**

Lets have some fun with this one. This is a hilarious era, so lets find out who it will be\~ Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAal8xHfV0c) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

A few notes beside our typical rules... Please DON'T ***NOT*** pick a former member just because they are a former member of EXO.

If you weren't around and you don't know about the former members, be sure to take the time to notice them in these performances as they were just as fantastic as our current members.

I am back with yet another report translation. The latest report came out yesterday according to  and I believe it covers the period from the 1st of January to the 30th of July.

There is nothing revolutionary or shocking in this report but I will roughly translate bits EXO is mentioned in/that affects EXO anyway, just for fun. It is a little boring for most fans I think but if you are a business/market/contract nerd this might be for you...

However, as per usual, I have a huge DISCLAIMER first :

I am not ""spreading rumours,"" all I am here to do is translate what has been reported. I do not audit or create the reports, I do not have power in what gets green-lit and what does not in SM, I simply translate what I read. That is all. Don't shoot the messenger please...

I will only be translating for EXO, I only read EXO's parts because I am a fan, but I do have the full reports. If you want to know if there are projected details for any other SME group, please message me personally here \[and I may be able to help you\] or on my other social media if you know me already from other places. You can also ask me any EXO-related questions (or clarification) below :)

# ! TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

&amp;#x200B;

General summary of EXO as an artist under SME:

&gt;""... Our artists... \[including\] EXO have aided in raising lots of interest in Korean culture worldwide and helping to create a 'ripple effect' in several fields.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;... In April of 2012, the 12-member boy group 'EXO' debuted in Korea and China and became the next generation global star, expanding K-Pop's global market and creating added value to the economy \[export diversification\].

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 2013 \[SM artists\] also broke/created(?) several records in the music industry. EXO's 1st \[full\] Album 'XOXO' (1st full/regular album released June 3rd and 1st repackaged album August 5th) sold ONE MILLION physical copies only six months after its release \[December 27th, 2013\]. This made EXO the first group, and 'XOXO' the first album, to hit one million physical sales in 12 whole years \[since 2001\~\].  
&gt;  
&gt;\[This is why industry professionals and media say that EXO broke a 12 year physical drought/a 'dying industry' a.k.a physical sales.\]

&amp;#x200B;

# 2018 () ( 100 ) - 2018 Music/Recording Industry Market Share Holders (Top 100)

&gt;SMENT is the no. 1 market shareholder, with over 5 million in sales rates/volumes(?). They hold/own the highest /percentage of the market with 24.27% of the shares.

[\*Above chart is based on the TOP 100 monthly data.](https://i.redd.it/wyglvp61ojg31.png)

# 1)    - [Active] Major Contracts

   ,      - Artist Management, contract status.

[\^ All EXO 9 current 'EXO' members still under contract with SME.](https://i.redd.it/nz3bdcu7sjg31.png)

Also for people who are still unaware/wonder... Yes, as you can see, all three former members are to pay SM part of their incomes until 2022, I believe, and there are Japan and Korea promoting restrictions...

[... Meaning they're still under contract, as you can  see here.](https://i.redd.it/u6ozpieksjg31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

# 2)     - Overseas Licensing Agreements

In regards to the report that was released PRIOR to this report:

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

I know I posted a translation yesterday but we've been hit with a bomb of eight different reports just this afternoon :') So... I'm back again. These reports cover:

\- EXO's impact on SM's second half of this year and,

\- EXO's predicted (positive) impacts on SM's falling profits following certain activities....

So read on below to find out what.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# ! TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

&amp;#x200B;

SM's profits haven't been up to standard/prediction allegedly, however SM believes that due to EXO's upcoming comeback and EXO's current/recent actities (A.K.A Baek Hyun, Se Chan), album profitability will recover in this year's second-half (herein referred to as simply '2H') earnings projections/expectations.

&gt;""EXO's album sales \[alone\] can defend earnings.""

According to the industry researcher, **excluding** Byun Baek Hyun's solo and EXO-SC 2H sales (combined sales of 850,000 albums in July alone), EXO's regular album in the fourth quarter ('4Q') alone is expected to bring in 4.46 \[4,460,000\] million sales, which is 92% of 2018's annual sales (, 2019)

Dreammaker is expected to hold concerts for over 10,000 people, which includes EXO's concerts (and two other artists), and concerts held in Japan is expected to reflect about 1.1M concert goers in total including EXO's concerts alongside TVXQ's. The upcoming EXplOration concerts are expected to be 'large-scale' operations.

As mentioned prior, EXO's ""selling power"" (combined with SUJU's) is expected to be enough for SM to **not** have to reduce their projected profit projections. In fact, do to the full comeback of EXO in 2H combined with EXO's 'large scale' JAPAN and Dreammaker concerts, projected profits are expected to be 10 billion won (8,270,000USD/12,197,009.50AUD).

There will be an expected 'performance gap' from EXO in 4Q due to the start of military era/recruitment that all boy groups eventually face. EXO's performance contribution next year will also be small \[... as there are rumours of 2-4 EXO members applying simultaneously by the end of 2019/early 2020\]. This is worrying for SM as there is no current rookie boy group to fill the gap and SM's main boy groups are currently showing signs of struggle(?)

Industry professionals say that it will be impossible\[/unlikeable\] for the project group SuperM to fill the gap with new members once EXO's and SHINee's member begin to enlist.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Round 1 Winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cq3xwv/game_time_which_member_owned_the_wolf_era_round_1/)

&amp;#x200B;

# ! TRANSLATION BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

[EXO's sales are in RED](https://i.redd.it/w9hz6pzaaih31.png)

***\['2Q' means 2nd Quarter - I believe 2Q is usually 1st of the 4th month \~ 30th of the sixth month\]***

2Q'15 - EXO = just under 800,000 pieces.

2Q'16 - EXO = just under 800,000 pieces, and a little more than 2Q'15.

2Q'17 - EXO = under 200,000 pieces.

2Q'18 - EXO = just under 400,000 pieces.

2Q'19 - EXO = around 200,000 pieces.

**2019, 7th month = just under 1M pieces.**

MY DISCLAIMER:

* I am not claiming to be an SM Staff!!!!!! All my sources are just from trusted reports/reporters/analysts, sites, databases and/or news articles from Naver (No ALLKPOP :P).
* I am not translating rumours, I am translating reports.
* Please do not shoot the messenger.
* \[Things in brackets\] - Added by myself to make sentences make a little more sense and/or to give context OR explanations by me.

In regards to the report that was released PRIOR to this report:

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

In another report I translated and uploaded, it explained the record/music contracts that EXO (+ lawsuit-line) are under with SM &amp; subsidiaries/partners. You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_semiannual\_report/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_semiannual_report/)

In the previous report, it explained EXO's expectations &amp; impact on SM's income and sales as a huge ""selling power."" You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_industry/)

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# Play this week's game --&gt; Call Me Baby Era

I honestly don't believe this is a bad era for ANY member, so this is going to be a wild game. Below is a reminder of the rules:

Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled[ Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfsla_Uh80) era!

* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

// If you have the time or want to it answer it would be really appreciated! Its okay to only answer the ones youre certain of like you dont have to answer all if you dont want to/cant! 

1. What are versions of exo-ls name (nicknames etc.) and where do they originate from because I see like erigom and phixo and I think they mean exo-ls but Im not really certain? 

2. (TW, idk if anyone is sensitive abt this?) Does anyone know the dates the members are coming back from military service or is it not certain? I hate myself for not stanning earlier I- 

3. Whats the best performance(s) exo has done I need to see? 

4. Are there any particular and active, not cringey, inside jokes yall have? 

5. Any special/fun things I should know about each member that isnt really well known already? Or any like trademark things any member have? 

6. Does the members have their own emoji?* *For example when translators write the dialouge theres often an emoji for each member of a group so op doesnt have to type their names all the time. 

7. What are the members majors? 

8. Ive seen some theories about their storyline, is the story still developing or did it end a while ago? Also, does anyone really know what happened or is it all theories right now?

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Last Weeks Results --&gt; Call Me Baby Era\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cuo8ru/game_time_which_member_owned_the_call_me_baby_era/)

# Play this week's game --&gt; Power Era

Two killer era's back-to-back! I honestly think Power was one of their best era's, everyone looked amazing, sounded good and just had SO much fun. Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the [Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRv8ZBLuW0) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!! 
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

We would love for our community to feel involved in the decisions we make so........

**If you are a graphic designer, artist or just like to put pictures together** and want to take a stab at making a banner for the subreddit, than this challenge is for you! We will be leaving the submissions open for just over 2 weeks and than we will be posting them all up for a vote on which banner the subbies like best\~

**If you aren't any of these things or don't have time to participate this round,** but have ideas or examples of exo (or non-exo) designs and things you like, comment below so people who are participating know what others like! You can help guide us and give us inspiration\~ 

# Guidelines:

* **Must be group focused:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall. It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together). 
* **Must be the following size:** 1920px x 192px in .jpg or .png format
* **Submit to:** [rexomods@gmail.com](mailto:rexomods@gmail.com) by Sunday, September 15th at 11:59pm

**Examples of past banners:**

I am new to the fandom and am just starting to gather subbed videos. The master lists this sub has created are beautiful! As I continue to learn how to navigate through resources, I'm having a difficult time finding where EXO has been featured on Japanese programs. 

I'm looking for the show titles/(full) videos/subs of the Japanese shows EXO has appeared on. A few clip examples come to mind: Baekhyun dancing to PPAP, D.O acting out ""have you eaten yet?"", Kai's shimo shimo gag with comedian Hirano Nora, CBX promotions, drama interviews, etc.

If there is a method of distinguishing these kinds of shows, please let me know!

\-so much more to behold :)
