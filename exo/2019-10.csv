I have heard its the popular members that have made the cut to be in this group. In that case why not chanyeol and sehun instead of baekhyun and kai , because whenever i search exo's individial popularity i also see them at the top too. Another reason is that they want the best of best and i agree on kai, he is one of the best dancers in kpop. So why not chen?? He is also regarded as one of the best vocalists too. So is there any specific reasons??",28,9

&gt;DISCLAIMER :  
&gt;  
&gt;While these reports are official sources, that does not mean that the schedules or plans reported in them are SET in stone. I am not ""spreading rumours,"" all I am here to do is translate what has been reported. I do not audit or create the reports, I do not have power in what gets green-lit and what does not in SM, I simply translate what I read. Don't shoot the messenger...  
&gt;  
&gt;Often times, reports simply show the projected summaries of what SME would *like* to do with their artists \[from what I've observed over the years\], however the final product/schedules are *fully at the discretion of SME* and there are many, many things that are scrapped and/or replaced whether it be for financial, personal or undisclosed reasons. As for 'smaller' schedules like fashion show appearances or collaborations with other artists, those are usually not in these reports...  
&gt;  
&gt;I will only be translating for EXO, I only read EXO's parts because I am a fan, but I do have the full reports. If you want to know if there are projected details for any other SME group, please message me personally here \[and I may be able to help you\] or on my other social media if you know me already from other places. You can also ask me any EXO-related questions (or clarification) below :)

# ! EXO SCHEDULE TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

[3Q Previews &amp; Expectations :](https://i.redd.it/2nxlrkn3bvp31.png)

SME album sales have increased drastically thanks to the efforts of *EXO BAEK HYUN* \[who sold 550,000 units as of August 2019\] *+ CHAN YEOL &amp; SE HUN* \[who sold 410,000 unites as of August 2019\]. Of the 1.4M/1.5M \[the reports say these two numbers, presumably because it is in between\] total SME sales in 3Q \[minus Sept.\], EXO members, without a full group comeback, make up 960,000 units by themselves.

SM are expected to hit and surpass 2M units thanks to EXO's upcoming group and solo \[CHEN\] comebacks.

To put EXO's selling power into perspective, the reports named three other SME artists who are collectively expected to sell around 3M additional albums with their upcoming comebacks, while EXO are expected to help reach 2M alone.

EXO's most recent concerts have brought in 90,000 of 150,000 concert goers between the two mentioned artists.

&amp;#x200B;

[4Q Growth Expectations + U.S. Expansion :](https://i.redd.it/0omqunrdcvp31.png)

U.S. expansion is estimated to aid in the overall operating profit of 18.4 billion KRW \[+21% from 3Q\]. U.S. expansion is focused around Marvel collaborations \[you will have already seen previous Marvel collabs for EXO-CBX, they are now trying this in mainstream America instead of just Japan goods\] and SUEM group actives \[KAI/BAEK\].

EXO along with another group are expected to bring in 500,000 people with their Japanese tour combined.

CHEN comes back TODAY, 6pm KST.

SUEM debuts in Hollywood on October 4th.

AGAIN, HERE IS MY DISCLAIMER:

* I am not claiming to be an SM Staff!!!!!! All my sources are just from trusted reports/reporters/analysts, sites, databases and/or news articles from Naver. (No ALLKPOP :P)
* I am not translating rumours, I am translating reports.
* Take this with a grain of salt, just like I do.
* Please do not shoot the messenger, or believe these reports with all your heart. Even the reports themselves sometimes say 'perhaps'/'maybe' this will happen lol...

In regards to the reports previously released :

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

In another report I translated and uploaded, it explained the record/music contracts that EXO (+ lawsuit-line) are under with SM &amp; subsidiaries/partners. You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_semiannual\_report/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_semiannual_report/)

In the previous report, it explained EXO's expectations &amp; impact on SM's income and sales as a huge ""selling power."" You can find those here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_industry/)

# New Series: Song Showdown

I really wanted to do EXO Members best hair colour/style next, but as I worked away on it tonight I realized it will take me over a month to collect all the photos needed to run that game. So, while I work away on that lets do some quick games of Song Showdown\~ 

# How to Play

1. Take some time to think about your ***LEAST favourite*** ***songs*** from each of the EXO-CBX albums. 
2. Go vote for which songs should be voted out of the first round! 
3. Come back from Friday - Tuesday to vote for your favourite tracks that made it through the cut!

Please only vote once, this is just a game, it is all for fun, there are no true answers here.

Our Lay has accomplished so much since his last birthday so lets commemorate him on another hard working year!



He released NAMANANA and it debuted #21 on Billboard 200, #1 on World Albums Chart and #1 on Independant Albums Chart. The digital album had a sale of 1.006 million copies sold on Chinese platforms. He hashtagged #[NAMANANAChallenge](https://twitter.com/layzhang/status/1056055713301217280?s=20) and we have not stopped seeing t-rex's since. He gave me my favourite interview to date, [thank you BuzzFeed and his cat, Cat](https://youtu.be/jujiQQU_9Rs?t=67). 

Lay gave us this soft Christmas song '[When It's Christmas](https://open.spotify.com/track/2bimU81DVIiZDvgjWtD27m?si=uwsa2PVLTSGPln14oFIslQ)'. With the help of Alan Walker, he released '[Sheep Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kthhAjR4CBs)' and with his new bro Jason Derulo, he featured in his song '[Let's Shut Up &amp; Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBWgqb3KIeA)' (with NCT 127!). Last collaboration he had was with Far East Movement and their song '[LoveBird](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Fjp9RR9mwtQHKACnqew5o?si=kOk7KkZjT4KAmwQAqunImA)'!

He attended the [61st Grammy Awards](https://twitter.com/layzhang/status/1094705662100029440) as FM Donggan 101's ambassador and the only official Chinese organization invitee and [finally ate that hot dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btu0RVdnI_j/) he had been dreaming about. Seriously, [he's obsessed](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Kve5iAsJF/). 

Lay released a mini called '[Honey](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btu0RVdnI_j/)' and opened up his own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCROoY31pgrU66oSzkYdWWmw/featured)! 'Honey' set a new records on QQ Music! 3 minutes &amp; 27 seconds to reachHall Golden Recordstatus, breaking his own previous record reaching best selling album of 2019! It was the 'Golden Song of the Year' at the 2019 Global Chinese Music Awards. 

Actor!Xing made an appearance in the show 'Golden Eyes' (which had about a million episodes) and won the Best Full-Length TV Drama award in Seoul International Drama Awards.

New year, new advertisements! This year he partnered up with Pizza Hut China ('Pizza Air' has sold 4.9 million pizzas in 4 weeks), Wong Lo Kat Herbal Tea, Perrier Mineral Water, H&amp;M, Calvin Klein Jeans and Underwear, Daniel Wellington and just recently because the official spokesperson of MAC for all of Asia Pacific.

Last but not least he finally held his first solo concert 'Grand Line'\~ The concert in Chongqing stop ticket pre-sale was sold out within 3 minutes and 26 seconds.

So i always thought it was the exo-m members that were more popular in china than the exo-k members. Like xiumin, chen and obviously the chinese members. But to my surprise sehun is the most popular member after the chinese members. How did he get that popularity? Have he acted in any chinese movies or dramas or anything related to chinese. He have also won popularity award.Or is it fully because of his looks?? Which confuses me because, in the youtube channel called asian boss, one woman have told that pretty boy looks are mostly popular in china. So i can understand luhan being very popular there.

I often try to think about what I would ever say to any of the EXO members if I ever had the opportunity to speak to them. They have impacted my life in so many ways and brought me so much strength and happiness I just always wish there were the right words to tell them. I could never repay them back for the years of happiness they have given me but sometimes I think writing these little reminders help me remember why they are so important to me, and why I am a fan.  

I think I just really would like to tell them thank you for everything they have done and been through in order to bring happiness into our lives. Because of them, I have met my best friends, smiled on days where I normally wouldn't have, and continued down my dream career paths because they encourage us to do so.

229,2019-10-26,2019,10,26,3,dn1tec,Various thoughts on Exo,ianna11,1572029029,"I would just like to share my thoughts on many things surrounding exo

1. Now that I have digged deeper, I am sad SM did not let exo reach its full potential, I'm not saying they would have been like BTS, but they could have been bigger, outside asia, they are not much recognized. They were still very popular when SM slowed down in promoting them. SM should have focused hyping them up, more music, varieties and shows.

Proof that exo is very is that it is still the second top group even members in the past 2-3 years were busy on solo activities, or not busy at all.

2. I didnt like exo being nominated in the AMAs. It was obviously for clout and fanwars, for the drama. Also MAMA should have spared exo, we all know bts is bagging everything, so no hype from exo-ls.

3. Which brings me to another point, I feel like exo-ls are getting few and not very active nowadays, the fire burning is not there anymore. We do not engage us much, I'm not very sure about this.

4. XiuSoo's military affected exo's popularity. 

5. Fans have to admit Kyungsoo enlisted for AWTG. It was the best choice for his career as SM was really sloppy.

6. I feel that this comeback will be the last before their hiatus.

7. And exo (except solo chen)  is not attending the SBS Gayo (not confirmed yet) but the reasons could be, either the closing act is for bts, so it would be awkward for the two groups. But I believe the reason could be the date (Dec 28) is very near suho's enlistment.


Tldr
SM wasted exo's potential
AMA should have not nominated exo
Exo is getting less popular
Ksoo enlisted because SM has no clear goals for exo anymore
This will be the last cb before hiatus
Exo will not attend SBS Gayo",2,1

But then I saw performances of it and they were stunning, they were awesome, they were so magical that I was like ""Okay this song is awesome I suck"" Hahahaha. Baek's high note definitely had something to do with it but I loved them singing with the lights in the ground and their outfits were so cool, I love the performance of it soooo much!!

A song I didn't know about until I started watching concerts was Drop That. I hadn't known about this song until my friend started sending me clips of the Japanese concerts and I was like ""Woah, what is that, that sounds hype af"" And then we watched the whole concert and I was floored, it was soooo cool. I got into my car and turned up the bass and paaaaarty!
