And I really want an Exo Album but I can only afford One

I had narrowed it down to 

XOXO - Repackage
Love Me Right
The War - Power of Music

But I Realised I can't Buy XOXO, because I would need both Korean and Chinese Version, because Exo-K &amp; Exo-m

Now I can't Decide between Love Me Right, And Power of Music

Which do you think I should get. 
I'd Get both if I could, but I cannot

&gt; Since he can remember, Chanyeol has felt this indescribable Itch under his skin; always nagging -urging him to do something. Creeping and crawling up his spine and digging itself into the back of his skull. But he had no idea what it meant or why he was plagued by it.

&gt; Until he met Kris.

It's your friendly neighborhood mod Kelsey here, aka the chick who does the sub banners!  Well, the chick who USED to do the sub banners, because after this post I will be officially stepping down as a moderator of /r/EXO.

TBH, this isn't quite how I imagined leaving, especially after 2.5 years.  However for a variety of personal reasons and timing, I know I can't push off this decision anymore.  Not that I still don't adore EXO, but I'd rather my adoration feel more like a fun hobby I can indulge in when I choose to.  Unfortunately, modding really doesn't allow for that.

However, it's not all doom and gloom!  /u/99101004 aka Jamie, our former moderator, is back on the ticket, and will be bringing in a whole team of long standing subbies to run this puppy to its fullest potential!  They have a real vision on how this subreddit can function, and I can't wait to see the results of their efforts.

Thank you all, every one of you, for coming here and making this place what it is, and for giving me an absolutely fantastic 2.5 years as your mod!  &lt;3

As you may have seen in our [Casual Convo thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7hf1l7/exol_casual_convo_144/) this week, /u/anigym6 has decided to step down as mod after 2.5 years on the sub. We are all very sad to see her leave, but the new team is very excited to get started on helping build r/exo back-up. 

You may know me already from the subs discord server or as a previous mod on r/exo under the username *jamiepiper*. But if you dont know me then, Hi! I am Jamie and I own the exo [discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) better known as exocord and my ult bias is Xiumin. I discovered exo during the CMB era and since than I have been an active member in the exo fandom community, trying to meet and expose more people to exo. I wont spend too much time on myself as I would like to officially introduce you all to your new moderators below. 

I have thought very carefully about who I wanted to join me on this team to help on the sub, some of them you may recognize more from this subreddit and others you may know more from our [discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP). But I guarantee you that they are all active members of the fandom who are Mods and Managers from exocord who all do a great amount of work on things like master lists, welcoming people and organizing group watches. Also they all love exo a lot, so I guess that is a bonus. 

#Welcome to all our new mods~

**/u/mochismyeon**  Hi! My name is Ang and Im thankful to help the mods and be apart of this team on r/exo, I will also be working on keeping all of exos variety up to date! Ive known about exo since 2014, but actively joined the fandom during the Call Me Baby era. If you happen to see me on exocord, I am (usually) actively talking about my love for [mochi cheeks](https://78.media.tumblr.com/836fef68c090eb12941eb30697cc9de6/tumblr_inline_ovqq96ZDrc1uip2hn_540.gif) and the occasional screams for shinee + various other groups that I love. 


**/u/carinabon** Hey guys! Im Carina, I am really excited to mod here at r/exo. I love Park Chanyeol, especially his big reactions and his genuine words. I found out about exo through Roommate when Chanyeol was on the show during Overdose era. I currently am a Manager on the EXO discord. Im also a big Red Velvet &amp; Seventeen fan and cant wait to get to know you all! 

**/u/joyceberry** Hi everyone! Im Joyce, and Im super excited to help moderate r/exo. Im an active member and local class clown of exocord, so I really look forward to helping manage the subs content and discussion. I discovered EXO around Love Me Right era, and have never looked at Yankee hats the same since. My bias is Xiumin, and Im also a huge f(x) and Seventeen fan! If you ever need advice, photo card referencing, or general shenanigans, my DMs are always open :) 

**/u/ladidalia** Hi all! Some of you may know me as Lia and one of the mods over at the Discord server (: Ive been a casual EXO fan for ages, but finally fell down this glorious rabbit hole during the Monster/Lucky One era with Lay stealing my [heart.](http://i.imgur.com/Z5dHuBT.gif) Im always open to talk about anything ranging from Kpop to makeup/skincare so dont be afraid to say hi! Im looking forward to help put with r/exo!


**/u/fringeoflife** Hi! Im Megan. r/exo helped me get into the fandom a little over a year ago and exocord pulled me down further. Chanyeol has had me ever since I watched him play with children on Return of Superman. Im very easily bribed by pictures/gifs of any EXO member with kids. Ill be helping update some of the master lists and making sure everyone is properly festive for EXO birthday celebrations. Im also a huge fan of Seventeen and SF9. Im always down for watch parties and excited to get started!

**/u/Xaille** Hey there ~ Im Sarah, a mod from exocord. Ive known exo since teaser era but didnt really get into them until Baekhyuns drama, [Moon Lovers](https://i.imgur.com/iBzyNCh.gif) came out. Baekhyuns the guy I could never get rid of so I ended up ulting him. Ill mostly be in charge of Instagram updates, the Exocord Photo Collection Master list and helping out with the subs banners. Im a graphic designer that loves to game and eat food. My inbox is always open, so feel free to ask any questions or just chat away!

**/u/Kerthiya** Hello! Im Shana. Ive been into Exo since teaser era. My bias is Kris and Im really excited to be a mod here on r/exo. Ill be doing updates about Kris, Luhan and Tao for the most part and working on the Advertising Master list to get it up to date and keeping everyone updated on the newest cfs. [I like to help people spend their money on exo fan goods :)](https://i.imgur.com/7PNU164.gif) 


**/u/wistfulove** Heyo! Some of you may know me as Wist :) I've been a part of this fandom and this sub for 3 years now and am happy to be able to be more involved. My bias is [Baekhyun](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DevotedAlarmingConch-max-1mb.gif) and Im quite active on twitter and our discord chat if anyone wants to chat :3 I will be doing our fandom discussions like Throwback Thursdays and Fandom Fridays.

#Sub Feedback &amp; Discussion

On another note, we want to make it known that we will not be making any immediate changes to the sub, so do not panic! We currently have a lot of ideas on things we would love to do over the next few months to help improve the subreddit but after long discussions on this, our biggest concern was hearing from the community first before we put anything into action.

So here is your time to have a say in the future of r/exo! Please let us know in the comments below or by filling out this [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/avuj9xLo0xFOx9Ch2) if there is anything you would like to see tweaked, changed or even added on the sub. If you are unsure, here are some things to think about:

* Is there something you wish we were doing more of as a community? 
* Is there anything you would like to see more of like Group Watches, Discussion Threads, etc? 
* Is there something in the rules that has always bugged you and was hoping to get adjusted? 
* Are there master lists and other resources that you wish we had?

Again, we are so happy to be joining the community again as mods and look forward to hearing what everyone has to say! Please do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have or give the smallest (or biggest) feedback.

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and Im super excited to bring you r/EXOs CC #145! I feel like quite the [Lucky One](https://78.media.tumblr.com/e6724119b3c7fa64e4c09ddb4bc279bb/tumblr_o8gkzxfpJa1sb2ekfo1_500.gif). I just want to introduce myself again and say that I am very excited to introduce a new phase of CC for the sub. Ill do my best to keep you guys updated on fandom trends, remind you of upcoming events (so we can squeal about how excited we are), and starting with CC #146, help manage our new-and-improved selling threads! [Ooooh fancy~](https://media1.tenor.com/images/78bc8846c49dbb016a23622e18f5bc2e/tenor.gif?itemid=5288904) But really, the main point is to have you guys talking and telling us about whats going in your life, whether it be k-pop related or not! 

Since you made it this far, theres a little bit of homework to help us all get to know each other a little better :) Please comment with your name, bias, and what Harry Potter house you think youd be in. For bonus points ^that ^dont ^exist, you can include the house you think your bias would be in. If you dont like Harry Potter, thats okay! [We still want you to comment](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2fb6db056bc226cd39ad3bdbf5b93d93/tumblr_oti3v0jN6p1s3z68no1_500.gif) hahaha~

There is a lot to come so please buckle up because [its going down, down baby](https://pa1.narvii.com/6528/7020cc6db96bac3ac697de33bf8bf993654b0b77_hq.gif).

As a final note, Id like to advertise our subs Discord server! Its essentially a chatroom with a lot of cool functions, and of course, tons of EXO-L. If you dont know what that means, you can read all about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/index/discord) or [just click this to join us](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP). Hope to see you there! 

Thank you for reading,

---------------------------------

#Sub Updates

Since we have revamped the rules, title formatting, flair system, and much more, here is a shortened highlight reel of the changes weve been making! All elaborate rules can be found in full [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).

###Sub Activities

* **Casual Convo** - Going to become a bi-weekly pin with more conversation. Mods will be in there a lot keeping conversations going and discussing social happenings in the fandom. We miss our lively community!
* **Throwback Thursday** - This will become a monthly open discussion that will be posted 5 days before the first Friday of the month, when we will host a 'Throwback Night' to group watch videos together - a lot will be based around the content that gets posted throughout the week by subbies! 
* **Fandom Friday** - This will also become a bi-weekly thread that will be more submission-based, discussing cool things everyone saw that week rather than strictly mod recommendations.
* **ICYMI** - In case you missed it threads! Mods will be posting ICYMI threads on the days of BIG events like concerts or award shows. YouTube playlists will be made with collections of fancams that people will be able to add to. These can act like your one-stop-shop access pass to the event if your alarm didn't go off that morning ;) 
* **Galaxy Bazaar** - This will be a monthly thread filled with subbies buying, trading, sellings, as well as cool group orders. Dont know what a group order is? Just wait, and all will be revealed~ The name will be changing to ***Ex'actly the Right Price: r/EXO Buy, Trade + Sell thread*** 


###Submission Titles
Weve made adjustments to our titling format and flair system to ensure that our subbies can more easily share content! We intend for it to be more easy and relaxed, as the purpose is to spread information and recent happenings quickly. Weve lined out everything for you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_title_format) but if you have any questions, please dont hesitate to message the mods and ask! Any and all feedback is appreciated.

###Submission Rules
1. **Use Stage Names in Titles:** Don't forget, we were all new to EXO at one point! In order to help people learn the members, please make sure you are using the boys stage names from SM when posting and titling new content. This will make it easier for new fans to identify members more easily, as well as improve the subs search/archive. Feel free to use real names while commenting.
1. **No Clickbait Content:** No links to koreaboo, allkpop, asian junkie, onehallyu or buzzfeed are allowed. These sites are run on clickbait titles that are misleading, and typically rumors. Please message the mods for approval if there is something you think **needs** to be posted from one of these types of websites.
1. **No Repeat Posts:** Take a quick look before you submit to see if the content you are submitting has already been posted.
1. **Raw + Subbed Videos:** Before posting an English Subbed video please double check to see if the raw version of the video has been posted already. **(A)**  If it has been posted, please make a comment with the English Subbed video and mods will change the flair letting people know the English Sub is now available. **(B)** If there is no Raw version already posted, please post it with the flair ""VIDEO (ENG SUB)""
1. **No Rumors:** Please avoid posting rumors until there are official statements made from SM, EXO, or any of the members official studios. 
1. **Fan Work + Humor/Meme/Crack Content:** Are you an artist, writer, or video editor and want to share your work? We want to see it! Please post in one of our dedicated Fandom threads as a comment rather than a new post by itself.
1. **Selling + Trading Goods:** If you are selling EXO goods, please do not make an individual post about this, instead put it in our selling threads.

We will be keeping the [Google form open](https://goo.gl/forms/avuj9xLo0xFOx9Ch2) just in case there is anything you would like to see tweaked, changed or added to the rules and sub in general.",44,7

#NEWS

* **SPOILER:** [The unreleased half of Electric Kiss was playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/byunificial/status/944080952384294912)
* **SPOILER:** [Unheard/unreleased Song playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/chenkunsuki/status/944085763511042049), we are thinking its Track #7 from the album: ""Lovin You Mo""
* **SPOILER:** [Unheard/unreleased Song playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/michen92/status/944074497749016576), we are thinking this is another part from Track #7 from the album: ""Lovin You Mo""
* **MEET &amp; GREET** Each show will have a small meet &amp; greet for only 30 people who will get a special venue copy of Countdown (when it comes out), todays show's meet &amp; greet was Baekhyun, Chanyeol, Chen &amp; D.O! 
* **SET LIST** I haven't heard anything yet saying that the set list was changed, so it should still be the same as [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPjCfmGUEAA2NPN.jpg) (but all the original Japanese songs that were sung in Korean at Elyxion in Seoul, were sung in Japanese for these shows) 

#171222 EyXiOn

[Here is a thread of translations](https://twitter.com/byunificial/status/944131430359080960) from the show (I am going to do some highlights from it below, all credit does to byunificial:

* EXO had a screen inside the venue for Jonghyun that said: ""Jonghyun sunbaenim, who had always shined brightly on the stage with his passion-filled music has left our side. The reality that we cannot be with him anymore is heartbreaking. A true artist, Jonghyun sunbaenim. We miss you and love you so much. We will remember you forever. - EXO"" [1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRpC3aUVoAAEfSn.jpg) [2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRpDtv2UMAEYRlj.jpg)
* Suho said the back of kyungsoo's head looks like a microphone. 
* Chanyeol was speaking in Japanese about how the tension of the concert was high today, and he suddenly couldn't think of what to say next so he said 'uhhh...' and then the rest of the [members began harmonizing](https://twitter.com/byunergy/status/944208269202952193) [**(LIKE OLD TIMES)**](https://twitter.com/hotvscuteyeol/status/944195821087744000)
* Baekhyun asked everyone: Are you hungry? I am too. We are going to eat curry when we get back to our hotel. Eat curry today, everyone! Let's eat together '' Ah-ah. I'm not telling you where! **(FLIRT)**
* They dedicated Into Your World/Angel to Jonghyun. Suho said: Before our last stage, we want to discuss something with you all. Jonghyun was a friend, a hyung, a producer to EXO &amp; has recently passed away. Not only us, but I am sure many of you are hurting inside. For our beloved Jonghyunnie, we will now perform 'Into Your World.'
* During 'Into Your World', Chanyeol shouted out Jonghyun's name, something about being happy together that I didn't manage to catch. 

Some other cute Fan Accounts: 

* [Baekhyun pretend playing a golf with the standing mic and he got scolded by Junmyeon](https://twitter.com/reyeolie/status/944159419201241088)
* Chen changed the lyrics to Sing For You from [""My gift, that is given by God"" to ""My BEST ERIS, that is given by God](https://twitter.com/windlessdeer/status/944164822953869312)"" 
* [When they were performing Chanyeol and Sehuns rap part during Power, Chanyeol did something to Sehuns tummy and Sehun then held on to it afterwards](https://twitter.com/xunhuas/status/944175425768452096)

Welcome to our new-and-improved buy/trade/sell thread, where you can comfortably spend your money and gush over pretty merchandise. These will be going up monthly, so you can be sure theres always going to be something new to catch your eye! Feel free to comment about the following:


*  Items youre selling, photo/price are preferred but optional. 
* Items youre looking to trade, and for what.
* Items youre looking to buy 
* Tips for great deals, group orders, or rare merch (links to Twitter, eBay, etc. are allowed but within reason, please dont spam)
* Giveaways or free items 

Because of the nature of this thread, r/EXO would like to make a small disclaimer. We do not claim responsibility for any transactions posted or agreed upon in this thread. All actions are at the discretion of the buyer. Please be safe when buying/trading/selling: ask for photo or video proof, clarify shipping methods, and be aware of the authenticity of the merch you are looking for. Neither r/EXO nor its moderators are responsible for money, goods, or any other damages that could occur relating to this thread.

Phew, thats out of the way. I trust that our subbies just want to give their merch loving homes and [have great intentions](https://pa1.narvii.com/6423/1584f1df5d52191c69868e08febbb4ce6744ea26_hq.gif)~ :) 

As a final note, Id like to quickly mention group orders. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0cLMJ0i52ng5OaL0sB7hYdj_Mi5oBRseRA6tZOxoVo/edit) is a great beginner primer for group orders, which are typically hosted through Twitter. There are a few inaccuracies in here, but otherwise its a great introduction to those unfamiliar with what they are. In the future, Ill be posting a few cool group orders that have been catching my eye or seem popular with EXO-L. 

Again, please remember our disclaimer and exercise caution before sending money to anyone. Check their account activity, their posted proofs, how they treat others, etc. This weeks chosen GO is for [lightstick accessories](https://twitter.com/berryyeol/status/939982517771239424) in light of the current and upcoming concerts! We also have a Twitter list available to follow [here](https://twitter.com/xiubaektrash/lists/exo-group-orders) with all the latest updates.
