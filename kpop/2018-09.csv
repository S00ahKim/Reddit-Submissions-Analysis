If it is feel free to remove the post. So I'm a guy who likes Kpop and I want to buy some shirts from my favorite groups. The problem is most of the cool shirts are in womens only, not mens. Most of the shirts are also in Korean sizes which I know are smaller than U.S sizes. So what size shirts should I buy if I wear a mens medium and I'm buying a womens shirt that is in Korean sizes? Sorry for the long question, but I would really appreciate if you guys could help me out.",4,2

I've been trying to hunt down what creative team was behind the Rookie music video as well as the photographer for the album concept shoots.

Usually companies will give themselves a credit (like Digipedi does in their videos), however SM tends to not include that.
I've looked at behind-the-scenes videos and images, gone on Red Velvets offical website, looked at the Rookie album scans, and even asked knowledgable fan sites.
Unfortunately, others are as clueless as me.

If this is a very specific topic for this thread then I apologize and have no problem moving it to another!
Regardless, thank you to anyone who is willing to lend a hand!",0,1

The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and provide any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Hostile Comments

One of our guiding principles for r/kpop is to ensure that we have a fun and friendly community for fans of all groups to gather and enjoy K-Pop together.  Lately though, we've noticed an increase in hostile comments.  While criticism and negativity are permitted, it should be respectful of the artist and their fans.  **This is not Twitter.**  Throwing shade, trolling fans, and starting fanwars will not be tolerated.

A good rule of thumb is to not bring up another group or fandom in an unrelated thread at all.  Don't go into an EXO achievement thread and start boasting about BTS's achievements.  Don't go into a TWICE MV thread and say how Blackpink is so much better.  Don't go into random threads and rant about how much you hate ARMYs.  Comments like these only exist to start arguments.  Support your favs, but don't drag other groups or antagonize their fans.

If you see comments like these, just click the report button and mods will take care of it.  Don't get sucked into this kind of argument.  If you leave hostile or hateful comments you will likely get a friendly PM from a mod telling you to knock it off.  After that, you will be permanently banned.  We are already cracking down on these comments and will continue to do so.  Trolls and anti-fans are not welcome on r/kpop.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Fastest to X threads

We would like to propose banning threads regarding ""Fastest to X"" achievements.  They are kind of redundant with other achievements, but are more random.  For example, ""Fastest MV to 50m views"" would be banned.  However, we will still permit threads for ""Most views in a significant timeframe"" such as ""Most views in 24 hours"".  Significant timeframes are hour, day, week, and month.  They are much easier to keep a handle on than the ""Fastest to X"" threads.  Let us know how you feel about this potential change.  Do you think it's a good idea or a bad one?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Behind-The-Scenes Photos

Rule 5 states:  

&gt;""Direct image posts, gifs, and gfys of idols are forbidden with the exception of official teaser images or announcements.""

According to this rule it seems clear that behind-the-scenes photo threads such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/958xux/loona_favorite_naver_behind_the_scenes_photos/?st=JLC91OQH&amp;sh=e3877289), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/98qda8/loona_naver_behind_the_scenes_photos/?st=JLC919XE&amp;sh=77725ee3), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9an4aj/bts_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EC%86%8C%EB%85%84%EB%8B%A8_idol_naver_x_dispatch_hd/) should be removed because they are neither teasers nor announcements.  To fix this issue, we need to either change Rule 5 to include behind-the-scenes photoshoots or start removing these threads.  Mods would prefer to just change the rule to allow them, but as always we want feedback from you guys first.  Would you prefer these threads be allowed or forbidden?


&amp;nbsp;

#### Music Show Winners

We currently allow a separate thread for music show winners only for a group's first win ever.  Mods would like to expand this rule to allow a thread for the **first win for each song**.  We feel a group getting that first win during a comeback is big enough news to deserve a separate thread and it is often lost in the wiki posts.  Do you agree?  Would you like to see a thread for each song's first music show win?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Giveaway Rules

We allow giveaways on r/kpop, but there are two rules that have never been officially announced or posted.  We will correct that now.

1.  All giveaways must be completely free including shipping. No money should ever change hands.

2.  Users must not be required to take any actions outside of Reddit to enter the giveaway such as following, liking, or subscribing on Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, etc.

Besides these two rules, you can conduct the giveaway however you wish.  You can select the winners however you want.  You can restrict the giveaway to certain countries if you want.  It's up to you.  If you end up procrastinating for a long time or cancelling a giveaway, people will probably get angry and you won't be allowed to do more giveaways, so consider that carefully before you decide to hold one.

Let us know if you have any questions or suggestions regarding these rules for giveaways.

&amp;nbsp;

#### AMA Inivitations

Over the past couple of months /r/kpop has been trying to actively increase the number of AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) we conduct with people related to the K-Pop industry on the subreddit. Have you been enjoying these AMAs? What kind of people would you like to see come on to /r/kpop in the future? And perhaps most importantly, do you have any recommendations for people we should reach out to for AMAs? Let us know if you have any more questions regarding how these work.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",119,75

16,2018-09-01,2018,9,1,14,9c0pkf,How do you feel about K-Pop being so famous nowadays?,chriskhat,1535779964,"So I have been a huge k-pop fan for a very long time. 

I remember that I was made fun of by my friends at school for my interest in k-pop but that really didn't phase me. I found a small group of friends that enjoyed k-pop at school and only really talked to them about it because I was worried about the backlash I would get from my mates. Being an Australian male, there are so many perceptions of what a males should be (masculine, tough, self deprecating) and what they should listen to, so being a fan of k-pop wasn't very compatible with my group of friends. 

I was always hoping that one day my mates would find out why I love it so much. 

Recently, given k-pop's immense popularity, some of my best friends have become obsessed with k-pop (the same ones who would always give me so much flak for it in the past). I always imagined that this would be awesome, but to my surprise its been nothing like I've imagined. My mates have gone overboard with it, advertising it like they are so unique and it seems as though everyone accepts them for it. They even think its a cool and unique aspect of their personality! 

All of a sudden, I've been pushed to one side and the more I see my friends (which are also guys) go deeper and deeper into k-pop and acting like they're passion for it is unparalleled it makes me really upset- knowing what I went through. 

At the beginning, it really turned me off k-pop, but i'm start to rediscover my love for it. Don't get me wrong, It's amazing that k-pop has found international fame, but sometimes I really loved my quiet, unique escape from reality. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? ",2,1

As a note: If you look at the numbers I posted in May and the numbers I've posted now, some of them are lower despite being pulled either on the same date or later.  I'm erring on the side of there being an adjustment of some sort in the past few months and matching the currently available information.

Please note the last column tells you what date the numbers go through.  Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.

If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As such, might as well kick off the hype train with my album giveaway!
_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **20** brand new, unopened Dreamcatcher ""To be named later"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

1.  What concept do you hope we are getting this era (Vampires, Werewolves, Ghosts, ect)?

2.  What era did you become an Insomnia?  Alternatively, if you are not an Insomnia, what do you want from this comeback to push you over the edge?

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the Dreamcatcher discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2 giveaways.**

*Lastly, I really really hate to do this because I think asking for upvotes is in really bad taste, but since this is a 20 album giveaway, I really would like as many people to have a shot at it as possible.  If you could make sure to upvote this post at least enough to get on the front page of /r/kpop for visibility, I would greatly appreciate it!*",179,186

Whenever I go to her apartment we eventually get onto the topic of Korea/K-Pop. She's really into it, but I haven't had much exposure outside of a few songs she showed to me once or twice.

I've heard a few songs from a few groups and I know of some of the more popula ones (BTS, Super Junior) but I haven't done much of a deep dive into the genre because, honestly I don't know where to start.

K-Pop is important to my sister, so I want to at least give it a chance before I pass judgment, so I was hoping people who know a lot more about K-Pop can offer suggestions.

Leave any groups, songs or albums I should look into and I might post about my journey into the K-Pop fandom going onwards!

I'm looking forward to what you all come up with!",0,1

Hey y'all!

A   coworker showed me some kpop songs last week, and I am now hooked.   Specifically, she showed me music videos by AOA (Heart Attack, Bing   Bing) and Girls Generation (Genie, Hoot).

I've been discovering new  songs by these 2 groups of gorgeous, talented ladies ever since!



2 questions:

\-Any other similar groups / songs?

\-Is   there a place where I can buy a greatest hits CD for AOA or Girls   Generation? For example, if I want the most popular Carrie Underwood   songs, I can hit up Amazon and buy her ""Greatest Hits"" CD.



Thanks in advance!",7,2

I'm a guy and around where I live, guys don't look like kpop stars so I'm a rare occurrence in my area.

im 100lbs, rather tall (about 170cm) and ive been told i have long legs by quite a few people. im ambitious, and a total dreamer, as many people are. 

however, i have a question about who jyp will consider accepting at auditions. im only about a quarter chinese. im also guyanese (from south america) and french. ill probably have a picture of myself somewhere on my page, maybe even as my profile picture. 

does anyone think i could even have a shot at passing auditions? im beginning to lose hope haha~",7,5

### [Imgur Album of Results](https://imgur.com/a/C4h24zZ)

#### Breakdown and Comparison

* **Responses** - We had a total of 4286 responses this year which is down from 5054 responses last year and 6465 the year before.  This decline was expected because of the additional verification layer we added this year which prevented non-Reddit users from participating.  Although it may seem disappointing from a raw numbers standpoint, this census paints a more accurate picture of actual r/kpop users.  In case you were worried, the subreddit is [still growing every month](https://i.imgur.com/hC3xsUB.png) and averages nearly 600k uniques per month.  August 2018 also set a new record of over 9.9 million pageviews on r/kpop.

* **Age** - The 18-24 group stayed exactly the same at 61.4%. The 25-34 group increased about 2% while 13-17 decreased about 2% compared to last year.  This follows a similar trend from year before and the year before that.  We are ever so slowly getting older.

* **Gender** - The boys are back in town.  After briefly giving up the majority to the girls last year, the boys are back on top this year with 52.6% while the girls are at 44.8%.  Last year we had 50% female and 48.1% male.  This reversal is probably due to the Reddit account verification, but overall it is still a very even split and a sign of a healthy community. 

* **Sexuality** - We got even gayer.  Straight users are down again to 68.3% compared to 70.3% last year and 75.8% in 2016.  Bisexual users increased from 15.1% to 16.1% and Gay/Lesbian increased from 7.2% to 8%.

* **Relationship Status** - What is love?  79.5% of us are still sexy, free &amp; single and [ready to bingo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z94HSMdQuA)  Although this is slightly down from 80.3% last year, the percentage of us who are married or in a relationship is still exactly the same.

* **Employment Status** - Employed numbers are up a couple percent while Unemployed Students went down a couple.  This follows the same trend from last year and lines up perfectly with the increase in the 25-34 age group.

* **Location** - This year we asked everyone to select their country from a dropdown instead of larger areas.  The number of Americans increased from 45.2% to 46.8%.  Next was Canada (9.6%), then Australia (7%), the UK (6.7%), the Philippines (2.9%), and Germany (2.5%).  You can see the full breakdown of countries in the [this chart.](https://i.imgur.com/06nTG20.png)

* **Ethnicity** - We changed the categories a bit this year, but it didn't seem to make much difference.  Whites and Asians are still about even at 39.3% and 39.4%, which was the same as last year.  The other races and ethnicities were also nearly identical to last year.

* **How Do You Obtain K-Pop Music?** - Paid streaming saw the biggest gain this year increasing from 42.9% to 55%.  Conversely, piracy dropped from 36.5% to 26.2%.  Hooray to us for [supporting our favorite artists!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WVsMPZIT9E)

* **How Were You First Exposed to K-Pop?** - We split Friends and Family this year, but both groups added together are about the same as last year.  We added Social Media as a choice and 7.3% picked that.  YouTube videos dropped about 8% while J-Pop &amp; [Anime](https://i.imgur.com/As8QGR0.jpg) jumped from 2.4% to 7.1%

* **How Long Have You Been Listening to K-Pop?** - Newbie numbers are up from 9.8% last year to 12.1% this year.  [Welcome new K-Pop fans!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)  The distribution of the other categories was remarkably consistent, so we have a very even split of different groups on the subreddit.

* **Do You Know Korean?** - [No, we don't.](https://i.imgur.com/tzBm3sA.mp4)  The percentage of users who know little or no Korean went up a small bit, while those who know a moderate amount went down a bit.

* **Are You / Do You Want To Learn Korean?** - These numbers are all almost identical to last year in every category.  Still 52.3% who want to learn, but haven't started yet.  What are you waiting for?  [Click here now!](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/)

* **Where Do You Get Your K-Pop News?**  - There was very little movement in the news sources compared to last year.  93% of you still rely on r/kpop.  The rest of the sites had small changes, but nothing major.

* **How Often Do you Visit r/kpop?** - All of these categories stayed nearly identical within 1% of last year's numbers.

* **Favorite Group** - Red Velvet has returned to the top of r/kpop after falling behind BTS last year, and it wasn't even a close race.  RV was chosen by 43% of users, taking the top spot by a margin of 10%.  LOONA has moved into the top 5 after ranking 18th last year, and f(x) has dropped out of the top 10.  Your Top Ten Groups are:

&gt; 1. Red Velvet
2. BTS
3. TWICE
4. BLACKPINK
5. LOONA (1/3 + OEC + yyxy)
6. Girls' Generation (SNSD) (+TTS)
7. Big Bang (+Subunits)
8. EXO (+EXO-CBX)
9. SHINee
10. NCT (127 + Dream + U)

* **Favorite Soloist** - IU is still the queen of soloists with 31.6%, but Taeyeon is on her heels at 26.3%.  Hyuna's Lips &amp; Hips helped her move into 3rd, up from 11th last year.  Chungha made a similar leap from 12th to 4th, while Ailee and Heize dropped out of the top 10.  Your Top Ten Soloists are:

&gt; 1. IU
1. Taeyeon (Girls' Generation)
1. Hyuna (4Minute)
1. Chungha (IOI)
1. Dean
1. G-Dragon (Big Bang)

I'm losing my mind. So the video goes like this:

A guy who have dark emo hairstyles being carried by four people while he is sitting on the chair. Also, I remember them being in black robes. 

That's the only thing I remember and it's eating me from inside that I can't remember the name of the song. I don't even know if it's kpop anymore at this point of time.

Have there been any idols to not be as affected by a relationship scandal (idk if Taeyang and Rain were very affected after getting married, but they didn't seem to have a lot of backlash)?

From [esquire.korea instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnYYcwugjX5/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=r40qn1s9pukv) , [translation source: fantaemsie](https://twitter.com/fantaemsie/status/1037806186312228867?s=21) 

&gt; In my hurting eyes even now I see so many hurting young people. Thats the words of Lee Eun Kyung, director of the foundation , conveyed with difficulty. Director Lee Eun Kyung is the mother of Kim Jonghyun who left this world on the 18th of December 2017.  is the small foundation that the bereaved family worked together to make. September 6th, in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul, the simple establishment of the  foundation opened. Just like the name SHINee, the mother of the son who thought to advance towards the light, she made this organization in order to soothe the shadows of young cultural artists who are walking along the same path her son did. Its a program that offers help to young artists who are suffering from lack of a supporting agency. Moreover, its main goal is to establish a psychological counseling center to comfort young artists spirits who cant help but sustain big and small wounds while doing public activities. Every year in December, an arts festival will be held to honor SHINees Kim Jonghyun. Director Lee Eun Kyung said, Even now whenever I go somewhere and a song which contains my sons voice plays, its still a painful experience. However, Im always grateful that there are people who like Jonghyuns music even after my son left. Kim Jonghyun left this world, however, Jonghyuns music remains in this world.  operates on the basis of the royalties from Kim Jonghyuns remaining music. We remember the still shining as ever SHINees Kim Jonghyun.

**In summary:** As many already know, with the posthumous release of Jonghyuns Poet | Artist album, it was announced that all profits would be going to a foundation to be created by his family. The official plans for this have now been made public, with a focus on: 

1. Support for aspiring artists (I have read that this means scholarships for students to go to art high schools - [source](https://twitter.com/blingestblinger/status/1037776836036460544?s=21)). 

2. **Main goal: establishment of a psychological counseling center to comfort artists engaging in public activities.** 

3. A yearly arts festival held in December in his honor. 

These will be funded by his music royalties. 

There has also been a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd1KO9I45ahx0zj0BBmYIDw) created, though there is no content posted yet.

A few weeks back I was eating a delicious fried chicken sandwich from a Korean joint near me and the aforementioned song came on and I was fumbling around to get Shazam to recognize it. It didn't get it after 3 tries but eventually my girlfriend's phone picked it up and to my surprise, it was Psy. Ha!

So I added it on Spotify and began looking for more songs like this. While not exactly the same, I found these two other songs that I really enjoy by him:

* REFUGE
* LAST SCENE

Are there any other songs you recommend in a similar style?

I think Hyoyeon has a unique voice that could fit a variety of genres/concepts (jazz, EDM, hip-hop, etc.) and would honestly be amazing if SM gave her a chance. She's gotten three singles, but she needs a whole EP. Yuri and Sunny also deserve far more, especially after their vocals in Lil Touch.

Twice's rap line also have nice vocals and have honestly performed some of the best girl group rap breaks of this and last year (Likey, What Is Love?) , but they aren't given much of a chance to shine much in Twice comebacks either.

What group members do you think need to shine more in the future? ",1,1

In terms of eras, these past two years have really brought out new conceptual and artistic heights for idols: I'm not an SM stan, but the music they've produced in the last year have been 100% high quality. (Red Velvet's Peek-a-boo/Bad Boy era, Taemin's Move era, EXO's The War era, NCT 2018 era, SNSD's Holiday Night era, Super Junior's L
Black Suit/Lo Siento eras, etc.). There was also BTS's domestic and international success with the Love Yourself era, Twice's Likey era, Blackpink's long awaited Square Up era, LOONA's OEC/yyxy eras + the end to pre debut era, and countless others.

641,2018-09-08,2018,9,8,13,9e1fw7,Reccomendations for a K-Pop Virgin!,TheRealIanByrne,1536379308,"So my sister is really into K-Pop. Whenever I go to her apartment we eventually get onto the topic of Korea/K-Pop. She's really into it, but I haven't had much exposure outside of a few songs she showed to me once or twice.

I've heard a few songs from a few groups and I know of some of the more popula ones (BTS, Super Junior) but I haven't done much of a deep dive into the genre because, honestly I don't know where to start.

K-Pop is important to my sister, so I want to at least give it a chance before I pass judgment, so I was hoping people who know a lot more about K-Pop can offer suggestions.

Leave any groups, songs or albums I should look into and I might post about my journey into the K-Pop fandom going onwards!

I'm looking forward to what you all come up with!",16,1

There a lady with short hair (about down to her neck) sitting on a couch singing with piano accompaniment. The video wasn't very popular, and I'm almost certain that it was made by 1theK but I tried diving into their videos with no luck. I want to say the video was from 2 to 3 years ago, but I can't be certain. The song is sung in Korean for the most part, but the climax of the song she briefly goes to english and says something to the effect of ""Look in my eyes, I feel your love"" (big help I'm sure). That's as best as I can remember it, please let me know if ya'll have any ideas! Thanks! ",6,1

Also their song [Perfect Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCJKjblGo7Q) has been the perfect summer song imo.

Also, of the all the summer-themed comebacks this year, I was probably most impressed by [Dance the Night Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm5iP0S1z9w) and [Hyolyn's See Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDAqx45Duqw). See Sea I thought was a great twist on the tropical house genre and used Hyolyn's vocals really well, and DTNA was just super catchy and upbeat, with super fun choreo to go with it. So those would be my personal songs of the summer.",109,183

Oh My Girl has changed from Arin to Binnie. No explanation for this, and seeing the teasers for the upcoming comeback absolutely confirmed this.

BTS has changed from V to Jimin. When I first got into BTS (Dope era) it was V, but as of Idol era Jimin overtook V which would make the longest period to be around 3 years.

and even Fromis\_9 - who is my favourite girl group - has changed from Nakyung to Seoyeon. (Which is weird, because Nakyung was my bias through Idol School, pre-debut and debut, but now I can't deny Seoyeon as my bias for the group)

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I like any of the members any less, just these others in particular jump out to me more.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else have a case of this? How long after you started following the group did this happen to you?

For me personally, I'm looking forward to a pledis concert happening in 2019, watching seventeen and pristin have interactions and also nuest and other pledis artists having collabs, that would be amazing to watch. I also think this is possible since this year we get to have a lot of pledis content and by 2019 minhyun is gonna return to nuest so it's all leading up to a pledis concert(i hope)  
Another thing I'm looking forward to is izone which i know would debut this year but i guess they'll be more active in 2019 so i cant wait to watch their variety guestings and maybe reality shows.  
Also talking about variety guestings, I'd really like for seventeen to guest on knowing bros :(",141,92

Imagine if IOI still existed right now. It would rivial Blackpink and Twice but members like Sejong went to GUGUDAN. LIKE LOL. WHO EVEN REMEMBERS A SONG FROM GUGUDAN.

1. Do you guys think there will be a IOI comeback?

Its odd. The companies are probably losing more money compared to splitting revenues from IOI. Huge opportunity cost there where it makes no economic sense.",15,0

 For Mamamoo, a Solar album would be really good if it has the sound of all of her prior releases, and would probably do really well domestically, but an album from any of the members would probably be really good.
 For BTS, either a V jazz/lo-fi album or a Jin rock album. 
 For LOONA, a Chuu album with a Lee Hi or IU type sound, or a Yves album with a Sunmi-like sound.
 For EXO, either a Chanyeol/Chen jazz/rock album or a D.O/Baekhyun R&amp;B album. 
 For Blackpink, any member could pull one off, but a Rose, Jennie, or Jisoo album would be interesting to hear. 
 For SNSD, Hyoyeon's, Sunny's, Yoona's, and Yuri's solo albums were supposed to be here a long time ago. 
 For Red Velvet, a Yeri one would be interesting, but a Wendy or Seulgi solo album would be amazing. 
 For SHINee, an Onew or Key solo album. 
 For EXID, honestly any member, but Hani would do R&amp;B, Junghwa would do EDM, LE would do a cross between hip hop and jazz, and Solji/Hyelin would do either jazz or ballads. ",152,82

From classics like ""U"", ""Miracle"", and ""It's You"", to hits like ""Sorry Sorry"", ""Mr. Simple"", and ""Bonamana"", to new releases like ""Black Suit"" or ""Lo Siento"", for nearly every title, I can sing the chorus, dance the point choreography, and clearly recall the visuals from the music video. I can also recall subunit or solo releases from any of the band members. I wouldn't say I'm the most dedicated ELF out there, but I definitely have a great level of understanding and appreciation for their music.

And yet this morning I woke up, saw ""A-Cha"" in my youtube recommendations, and realized I couldn't remember anything about the song. I don't know which members participated in the comeback, I don't know what style or genre the song was, and right now I can't picture a single frame from the music video. \_()_/ sorry sj

844,2018-09-11,2018,9,11,6,9er6q7,What are my chances of getting accepted into SM Entertainment?,MemeWitch,1536614131,"Im half Caucasian and Half Chinese. Theres plenty of Chinese and half korean/white idols, but Ive never seen an idol with my exact ethnicity. I know that SM is trying to cater more to the Chinese market (ex: the upcoming NCT chinese sub unit, but hopefully it doesnt end up like exo-m  haha) so Im not sure how positively or negatively my ethnicity affects my chances. 

Just to get things out of the way, Im NOT auditioning so I can meet my oppas. I honestly couldnt care less whether or not I get to meet other idols. Im auditioning because I genuinely  would enjoy singing, dancing, performing, etc. I know both idol and trainee life can get ugly, I know its not as glamorous as it seems. I know that even if I became a trainee, theres a chance I wont debut, but its a risk Im willing to take. 

Ive been taking vocal lessons for a few months and my singing has improved. My teacher tells me that I have a good sense of pitch. Although I cant sing low notes that well, Im able to easily sing mid range notes to high notes. 

I know that looks play a large part in K-Pop so as  for my appearance, Im a 55 (almost seventeen years old) female thats on the thinner side. Im also pretty pale (even paler than the average caucasian) with clear skin if that helps. Im pretty critical about my appearance so Id give it a rating to average to above average. My friends have told me that Im pretty though, so I cant really say for sure. Ive also been told by 5 people that I look like an idol with bangs lol. 

I was planning to go to a SM monthly audition in LA but unfortunately its temporarily cancelled. I dont want to go to a global one because that would really lower my chances. I could send in an online audition but I dont think anyone has gotten a real callback from that. I could also try other companies such YG, JYP, Cube, etc. but it doesnt seem like they will debut another girl group anytime soon. Im not willing to try a company that requires a trainee debt either (the  big 3 and cube i think have gotten rid of the debt system) 

I know that realistically my chances are still slim since theres so many people that audition, but do I at least have a somewhat fair shot? Any feedback or opinions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!",12,0

It's the result of my effort to provide people some of their [most requested ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8v4kdw/im_a_kpop_lover_and_web_developer_that_wants_to/). It's live now! Feedback and feature requests are welcome at /r/darbl.
----------

Two months ago, [I asked /r/kpop for their most wanted features in a k-pop app](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8v4kdw/im_a_kpop_lover_and_web_developer_that_wants_to/). As a long-time fan I wanted to build something fun and useful for our community. Since then, I've been hard at work creating **[Darbl](https://darbl.io)** -- it's live and ready for your beta testing!


##### What does Darbl do?

[Darbl](https://darbl.io) is a mix of music videos, social media, news, and chat. It's a little bit like Twitch mashed up with Total Request Live from the 90s. The app provides:

- Top 100 songs from Korean charts
- Most popular tweets, videos, and articles about each song
- Song trend data (weeks on chart, peak position, etc.)
- Chat with automatic translation between English and Korean (and more languages to come!)
- Save your song preferences (favorite/thumbs down)
- Share your bias and see others'
- Full functionality as an anonymous user or login to save your preferences across all devices
- Use anywhere: desktop, mobile, etc.

**Zero ads. Anonymous. Totally free.**

So I recently learned how the term stan actually originated from the Eminem song Stan (took me way too long to associate the two). That got me thinking, Eminem was the best selling artist of the 2000s and has had an enormous impact on music. His prime (approx. 1999-2005) coincided with many well known Kpop groups training years and development stages. What impact do you think Eminem has had on Kpop? Artists such as TOP and GD, I would think would be the most heavily influenced. I dont follow groups closely or know much about Korean Rap so if anybody has any articles or knowledge feel free to share! Seeing as Eminems new album came out just recently I would also be curious to know if any Kpop artists would likely listen to it.",6,0

I'm working the register at a burger place and like my 6th customer in I see someone who looks incredibly familiar but I didn't really say anything. I take up his order and after I'm done giving him his food I look at his face and I just had to ask him if he's Henry because he's quite possibly the best looking customer I've ever had, he says ""yeah it's me man"" and I just say oh shit really loudly. Throughout the entire like one minute conversation I'm just like stumbling on my words and he's telling me he's in the area for visiting some childhood places, he was incredibly nice considering  my mind went blank so I started using curses as filler words in every other sentence. Pretty embarrassing but my biggest regret was not taking a picture, I was conflicted because I didn't want to bother him while he was eating and I didn't want to impede on the few moments he gets to himself (Didn't stop me from going to the back and telling all my coworkers but that's about it.) He's truly an outstanding guy, I've seen a lot of Youtube compilations and he's pretty much exactly the same online as in person. He's always been amongst my top 3 male artists, Eric Nam, Dean and Henry. I never got fanboy shakes in my entire life but I was just in awe the entire time he was there. He even stayed for a bit after he finished eating just to talk with fans, he's just an awesome guy. 

Just valuing his privacy, I'm not going to post where he was or any landmarks just that he was in Toronto earlier today. On the off chance Henry If you ever browse Reddit , thanks for making my day. I really hope I get to meet you again one day and get that picture X)

I'm watching her on King of Masked Singer and this girl has the most amazing voice. She doesn't even sound like a stereotypical Kpop singer. She's more in line with someone like Gummy or Lee Sora. She brings emotion, she can belt it out. Yet her career has been mostly with Exid and she's not even the most popular in the group. Solji has what it takes to be a solo performer. 

Son Seung Yeong. To me, she's the best singer in South Korea. Her vocals are like the kind of vocals you used to listen in the 90s with Celine Dion or Mariah Carey. There are times where I'm shaking when I listen to her sing yet her career has been mostly limited to King of Masked Singer and Immortal Songs 2 (where she's yet to win, as unbelievable as that is). I read she signed a record contract so fingers crossed. 

Rose (Blackpink). Rose, for me, has always stood out in Blackpink because of the tone of her voice. It's so different that it stands out more whenever she gets her solos and then I googled through her solo performances and it made me love her singing more. ",2,0

I like to leave kpop MVs playing on the TV in my living room when I'm chilling there, but its just slowly becoming less family friendly these days? I know this is in no way a new thing, UKTop40/MTV/Latin/Afrobeats music channels have been showing music videos like this for a long time, and even then, I've never liked them being shown, neither my family, you know? Kpop music videos tended to be more conservative, but lately I'm having to reach for my remote to switch to the next MV often, especially if parents or young ones were to come in. I just wonder if the trend of kpop music videos  will continue like this and whether it'll eventually lose its conservatism in future?",2,1

It's packed to the gills with legendary and influential groups in semi-hiatus. Even though JYP has surpassed it in stock value, SM still remains the largest Kpop company. 

SM during 2nd Gen had the most popular boy band and girl group. From Super Junior to Exo, one of it's boybands has dominated as the top boyband. Girl's Generation reigned as the Nation's Girl Group. 

At this moment in 3rd gen, neither of the top boy band or girl group are SM. BTS and Twice are now comfortably sitting at the top in their respective fields. 

SM isn't likely to regain either titles soon. Exo's members will be going into the military soon and NCT hasn't taken off enough to challenge the runaway success of BTS. Red Velvet has grown in popularity immensely over it's career but even it's position as the 2nd most popular girl group is under challenge from Black Pink. The upcoming girl group by SM is a wildcard, but it's a rookie taking on Twice in it's prime. 

So is this a dark age of sorts for SM? And will it take SM until 4th gen (whenever that's arbitrarily set) to reclaim either or both titles? ",169,128

1. AOMG 
why? hyuna is close friends with jay park &amp; they have the same risqu thing going on 
2. SUNMIS company
why? hyuna is close friends with sunmi &amp; im sure makeus would love to have 2 successful female artists, especially since they are rivals in the industry
3. HIGHLIGHTS company
why? they have also left cube &amp; it would seem like it would be a good fit. they also are friends with hyuna

Peoples that also plays Instrument in their music videos and so.
I really like Seo Young-Jun from LED Apple he played guitar. He was talented. Sadly LED Apple quit long  time a go..But he still plays live on Instagram. I also love Shin Tae Ho from LUNAFLY. He is Vocalist, Drummer, Pianist and he is really talented

Cube is a freaking mess now. Their stocks dropped big time and they are scared now 
Pentagon is gonna walk into the meeting room and say keep edawn or we are leaving with him. We didnt work our damn socks off for this you know.

YG are....once they take Lee Hi and One from the basement then Ill think about it. 

SM does stand for Shitty Management, but theyve looked after Dream so I guess Im happy. Sm look after NCT China Im trusting you on this

So there are a lot of idols that have unique timbres that gain fans partially because of it (obviously other things factor but I'd still guilty of this). Ex: GFriend Yuju, Blackpink Rose, BTS V, SHINee Taemin, LOONA Gowon, etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But today I was listening to Oh My Girl and every time Seunghee's part comes up I find myself loving her her singing. Yes she's a great singer (in a technical sense) but she's also got this sincerity that just makes me really happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of other examples for me personally are **Minnie** from (G)I-dle, **Jimin** from BTS , **The8** from Seventeen, **Chan** from UNB/A.C.E and **Olivia Hye** from LOONA.

I'd love to find new idols to have where I can just listen to them sing all day. ",6,5

Posts about songs or videos being the fastest to reach any milestone are banned.  This includes fastest to X views, streams, sales, followers, and anything else.  Most views/sales/whatever in a significant timeframe are still permitted.  The allowed timeframes are hour, day, week, and month.

#### Behind-The-Scenes Photos are permitted.

Behind-the-scenes photo threads such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/958xux/loona_favorite_naver_behind_the_scenes_photos/) are now expressly allowed.  Rule 5 has been changed to add behind-the-scenes photos as an exception.

#### Music Show Winners are expanded.

A separate thread is now allowed to announce the winner of a music show for the **first win for each song**.

#### Giveaways rules added.

The following rule has been added to the ""/r/kpop Content"" section of the rules:

 * **Giveaways:** All giveaways must be completely free including shipping.  Users must not be required to take any actions outside of Reddit to enter the giveaway such as visiting another website, completing a survey, or following, liking, or subscribing on Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, etc.

#### Sales milestones added.

We have added 25K physical sales milestone only for the **first time** a group reaches this milestone.

We have added the official [""UK Singles Chart""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart) and [""UK Album Chart""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart) to the list of approved chart accomplishments.  Only three K-Pop artists have ever broken into these charts (PSY, BTS, and Blackpink), so we feel this is a rare and newsworthy enough accomplishment to permit a thread for the achievement.

**There are no other rule changes at this time.**  Thank you again for your feedback.  The next Town Hall will be on December 1st.  If you would like to give feedback before then, you can [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) any time.",27,107

Basically i want to protest about this decision by streaming Hyuna all weekend with Spotify premium, but will Hyuna receive her share or is the money going directly to Cube Ent's pocket?

4Minute has always been my favorite kpop group and I was really saddened when they got disbandeda after a single mitigate comeback. But with this new drama I'm starting to think that Cube Ent is ran by *fucking morons*and that's another saddening blow for me because my current gen's group is G-IDLE...

I'm gonna stream her anyway, like i did with 4Minute to show them at my own scale that they took a ridiculous decision to get rid of her (I'm not very familiar with E'dawn but Triple H was a breeze of fresh air) and I encourage every 4NIA to do the same, however it'd be nice to know if she'll get her share or if cube has some twisted contract with their idols.

While I'm here, what can we expect from their future, would a major record label how them after this? Would they create their own record label? Maybe form a coed duo a la Trouble Maker? Retire from kpop to focus on different activities?

In any case I hope the future will be bright for them, and i include you too Gayoon, Jihyun, Jiyoon and Sohyun if you ever hear about this post &lt;3

Record companies' greed getting in the way of idols' happiness is *not* a business model i will support. If you do fear personal life getting in the way then go ahead and do schedule mandatory limited free time for personal matters, but jeopardizing human beings future and alienating your fan base over a love powerful enough to risk a career for is both ridiculous and pathetic.

It's time to **wake up Korea!** You play at being a modern and civilized country but you are centuries behind when it comes to basic human rights... There's more to life than money, you've shown willingness to go international but i can assure you we international fans understand that materialism comes *after* happiness.

On this note, thanks for reading this far, i wish you a good day.

I know my question is quite uncommon and highly unrealistically but Ill just say it anyway . 

Ive been a kpop fan for about 5-6 years now, I am turning 18 ( M ) .

And I was wondering if theres any chance for a non Asian to become a trainee. I am quite decent at dancing , my voice is lacking but it can be improved / become a rapper . I guess I look  close enough  to the Asian standards , slim, smaller ish nose etc , softer features . 

I know its so much hard work and just really unfair , but thats my dream.. to entertain people, to make them happy just like my idols make me happy . 

The reason Im even considering this, is mainly due to BTSs success worldwide, thus in my head making companies, such as bighit, consider this  external  approach and maybe being more acceptable for non Asians . 

Kind regards,
Just a kpop fan .",2,1

I don't know their proper names, shame on me, I know, and I'm only familiar with them on Weekly Idol and Idol Room, though I'm vaguely aware they have done other things. As the title says, this is purely MC related, so please don't get upset at me for not taking other things into consideration.

As the title says, why do people like them so much as MCs? But it's not really simple to explain what I mean, at least in my mind, because that question isn't all I'm getting at though I'll admit they can be funny, and they know how to run a show. I'll also admit that I have a hard time telling between scripted and unscripted behaviours on screen. 

But how they treat the idols...how can people like them with how they do that? And I'm not just talking about how they'll let girls get away with things in games they don't let the boys get away with, or the understandable hype for girl groups over boys. The main thing that comes to mind is that one epsiode of Weekly Idol with BtoB and how they basically threw themselves on Ilhoon(i.e. hugs and kisses after he said he wasn't fond of skinship even with his members). I get that it was kinda long ago, but stuff similar to that still happens, the whole boundary smashing of sorts. And how they make the idols visibly uncomfortable.

How do people still like them as MCs after they do stuff like that?

(I'd also like to add that this mainly me being ranty-ish and upset because people be hating on the new Weekly Idol hosts despite the fact people look more relaxed with the new hosts.)",77,67

jimin also recently acknowledged during her comeback promotion that while she (jimin) loves pop/r&amp;b, indie music is definitely more of yerin's style. over the past year or so yerin's clearly been focusing on rebranding her solo image into one of being the front woman of a band that plays at festivals and as a fan i couldn't be happier! she's been so evidently untroubled and carefree since she created her band...i just hope she'll leak the studio version of [square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_md16sTcnPM) soon...",0,2

I don't even bother following fan accounts anymore. I just delete them from my accounts. I've been listening to the groups happily since.

You can do as you want, but I simply don't understand. ",49,0

1290,2018-09-16,2018,9,16,7,9g5qfz,(Fan account) Music Bank Berlin,Jynxette,1537051795,"My throat is killing. My back is aching. I don't know how to feel so here's a bed time story for you.

1. The line organisation was kind of a mess. So originally a number system hadn't been announced, and everyone expected to arrive the day of the event. Camping was forbidden. A few days before the event they announce they will do a number system, giving numbers out ONE day before. Europeans fans outside of Berlin scream cause you know. Those who were first showed up crazy early, numbered themselves, proceeded to number and list everyone else and then spoke on behalf of security who decided to follow their plan. Because of flights I turned up 6pm (when wristbands were gonna be given anyway) and had a number around 1100. Said screw this and checked in, came at 8am the morning of the event and was given number around 2200. 

2. There so many people but we were still unable to fill the whole stadium. Maybe half the people had lightsticks. Saw an IOI lightstick - super cute watching the girl wave madly for Somi. Also a couple NCT lights.

3. All the groups performed what you would expect. Exceptions being Taemin performed Hypnosis and omg... it was so pretty with the darkness, the lights &amp; Tae's singing. At this point some Shawols were crying. I understand. EXO performed Boomerang, What u Do, and their other titles. Gidle performed their titles. Stray Kids their titles. Wanna One their titles. 

4. Initial impressions of the performances. 

**Stray Kids**: omg they are so fun on stage. The way they move is so cute and energetic. They had a special stage where they sang English and I swoooooned at the Australian accents. It was Felix's birthday so the members embarrassed him and had the audience sing Happy Birthday in German with a big cake on display. Hella hilarious his reaction.

**Gidle**: tbh they are so gorgeous and their outfits also. I don't know the group that well.. *shoot me* but the rapper has so much charisma. I need to stay on top of this group asap. 

**Wannaone**: it's an experience seeing so many guys dance at once and when they perform it really is a performance together - seeing them all together just woah. Also Ong Seungwoo is so damn handsome in real life I can just not. Also at the end of the stage someone threw a tiger doll at Daniel who caught it and threw a heart back; everyone knows Daniel dishes out fan service well. 

**Taemin**: first impression has to be... Taemin has the skinniest legs out of all the performers today. Everyone screamed loudly for EXO but Taemin just as much. Minho and Key did a little video boasting Taemin and together the 3 of them sang a little of I Want You. Also his dance movements really do give off MJ vibes. After tonight I love you Taemin!!

**EXO**: the whole reason I travelled solo from the UK to Berlin. EXO's lightstick was definitely most popular &amp; they had the loudest screams. EXO &amp; Taemin got the whole crowd shouting their names before and after they perform. Just gonna blurt things out. But their jaws are so sharp, Kai is dance god, Baekhyun sang a bit of Young, we had a plan to sing happy birthday for Chen but cos of timing it was awkwardly cut off but Suho brought it up after a performance and we finally got to sing it. DO looks as out of place as he makes himself &amp; was first to walk off the stage (I aint mad lol this is DO). Kai threw his jacket into the crowd.

Other bits were BTS doing a message and everyone dropped their lightsticks and pulled out their phones; and the screaming ... waaa

Forgot the special stages :c chanyeol had a solo playing guitar. 

No accidents surprisingly although the front of standing sounded deadly. Lots of pushing. 

Right now I feel so empty lol. I've finally seen EXO guys ",48,143

April would be an example. 

The reverse is also true, where I would find a group very entertaining and attractive and have interesting choreo, but dislike most of their songs, so I would watch them but not listen to them (or only very few of their songs I actually like) Twice would be an example.

There are also some mixed cases, such as BlackPink. Great choreo and stage presence, but I like less than half of their songs, and despite the members being cute and bubbly, find their personalities boring when watching BlackPink House (especially compared to groups with really extra and adorable members like Loona, Mamamoo, Apink, Twice, etc.)

I'm a tad bit bored so I decided to post this hoping there are people like me who wouldn't mind easy chit chat - so here goes...


What if the whole of NCT China turn out to be a vocal group that does Chinese Ballads? 

Or what if YangYang is a complete 180 from his uwu looking appearance and is actually Main rapper? 

What if the next unit to come out after NCTC is NCTJ (Then at least Jaemin and Jeno would have a unit to be in after they graduate from dream next year). 

What if All the Chan's came together to form a Chan unit? (Atm I can only think of BangChan and Dino frm svt but I *Know* there's another Chan from somehwere)

What if Dino was in NCT Dream. 

Or imagine a SeungKwan, JungWoo and Vernon meetup (sometimes I remember they're the same age and I'm like huh?)

Imagine if Mark(NCT) was in Seventeen? So would the infamous phrase have been ""Mark nugu aegi?""

What if a Jeju Island Collaboration was done btwn SM and Pledis (at this point these are the only people I know from Jeju) and so BaekHo(Nuest), Seungkwan(Seventeen), Joy(RV), and HaeChan(NCT) form a unit singing sassy songs in Jeju Saturi? (I dont know so much about Joy, and know even less about BaekHo but the other two - sass runs through their veins! )

On that note, what exactly is going on in Hong Kong? The Loudness and Confidence Jackson and Lucas share is just.....I mean, you get me right? 

Ps. Woozi is the shortest male in Kpop right? 

Any thoughts on the above?

What are your ""what if's""?

I've had a couple and almost all were strange in some way: 

- First ever one: Ft. G-dragon. All i remember is we were standing face to face in a doorway and i had on a mans long-sleeved white shirt and he had green hair. This was veeerryy strange at the time I had it because I had just gotten into kpop (around late 2014 or so) and I didn't even like Big Bang. I woke up thinking wth?

The others in no particular order: 
- Jackson and Mark and I were sitting together at a fast food place, both sat opposite me and we seemed to be having an awkward-but-okay fan and artist interaction. 

- Seventeen's ThugHao - Two times. Can't really remember the second. The first though was around when he had his back injury. In my dream he was really ill and had a fever which i was trying to bring down. He was shrinking away (like the way a small child runs away from taking meds even though they're really weak) and it was not an aww momebt at all. A bit worrisome.

Seventeen's Sunshine - was shaking his butt. I dont remember much about that dream but i woke up traumatized. I never want to have that sort of dream again. 

JungKook and (not sure bit I think Doni (Yes that Doni)... I'm really not sure who it was) - we were four people and went through a haunted house, a really creepy one and JungKook wasn't scared but weirdly hyped? Again i woke up like huh? Because I dont really stan BTS either so this dream was so weird for me.

The following was revealed from the interview conducted between Goo Hara's boyfriend and the newspaper Josun Ilbo on the 15th.  


""It was me who first said let's break up due to our personality differences, but the truth is that the claim that this way a two-sided fight is not correct. I have never hurled a fist at anyone my entire life, especially toward a woman.""   


A picture of Goo Hara's boyfriend's face covered in cuts from the altercation was made public,

  
""If Goo Hara had been bruised, it would have occurred when I was just trying to calm her down while being hit and scratched, not directly from an attack by me.""

&amp;#x200B;

Goo Hara and hair designer Mr. A appeared together in the past on the cable tv show ""My Mad Beauty Diary"" and confirmed their relationship. After the broadcast appearance, Goo Hara made contact with Mr. A through social media. Mr. A didn't believe it was really her at first, but after confirming the account to be authentic, began exchanging messaged with her. It was announced that they have been contacting one another for around 3 months time. Mr. A has not yet been investigated by the authorities, which he says was due to the great deal of trauma as a result of the incident. ""Thanks to the help from a friend, I found a lawyer to represent me and agree to completely cooperate with the investigation.""

This Pink-haired girl and .......A....... have known each other for a long time (they were born in the same hospital, in the same month), but only recently started dating during the summer. Sometimes she's misunderstood by others but ........A........ has almost always been there to explain and clear things up. 

They're both sophomores now and not many people know of their relationship yet. 


They have a third friend called ........C........ She's got green eyes and is a bold and nice older friend to the two of them. 

But the thing is, somethings up with ..........A......... Recently, a Freshmen has caught his eye. 

........D.......... another smol girl who always smells like cherries and limes. She's can also be a crazy little bomb at times. ..........A.......... periodically finds his eyes straying towards her. Does he think of cheating? No. 
But she has his attention and he feels very supportive towards her. Her older brother ........E....... was very nice to him before graduating last year.

But then again, he's a nice guy, who sometimes makes others peoblems his own, and this worries .......C....... Sometimes. Because due to this niceness, .......B....... is showing some signs of Jealousy. She doesn't want him talking to other people. 


Someone has a crush on .......D....... Nobody knows. But she's like a flower to him. And he feels like a loser around her.

They are briefly relevant to Kpop but miss their opportunity. Some of them will eventually debut through another opportunity, sometimes even through another survival show. But plenty won't. So the stages from the show are the only time they ever get to shine. 

I'd point to Kim Nayeon from Idol School. Though technically she debuted with Berry Good, she left after the debut before she went onto Idol School. She caught my attention as the only relief in during the worst [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfW2CeOkVJ4) I've seen on a survival show. I really enjoyed her adlib during Idol School's cover of [""Rough""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJhROYRObYo). She didn't even make it to the finale though, and at 22 her odds for another chance are slim at this rate (it's crazy that's old for debut). 

So who are some contestants who impressed you or made you root for them that haven't made a debut yet? What stage would you point to in order to show why it's a shame they haven't debuted yet? 

Note: Someone like Somi doesn't count since she ""won"" the survival show and debuted through it, even though she hasn't re-debuted yet. ",159,116

This was because when I watched One Fine Day (still not knowing many of the members at the time), he spoke about how he raised chickens a few times. And him calling out """" when Jeonghan and co.

1379,2018-09-17,2018,9,17,13,9gh7j1,What are some of the things that many K-Pop fans are mistaken/ignorant about but you wish they'd understand/learn?,Wolf_Puppy,1537157638,"We all know K-Pop attracts a lot of very young fans, and many of them lack knowledge and life experience in just about everything -- how the entertainment industry works, how businesses operate, politics between countries, race/culture, songwriting, composition, arrangement, recording, mixing, mastering, vocal technique, dance, makeup, hair styling, fashion, photography, videography/cinematography, video editing, color grading, and even just the human condition.

What are some of the things that you wish the average K-Pop fan can learn and stop posting ignorant comments about? 

Although I can make a list about a mile long, I'll just pick a few that I see a lot of:

""They Photoshopped him/her too much"" - Vast majority of the time when fans make this comment, they have no idea what they're talking about, because usually it's simply the makeup, lighting, styling, camera angle/lens focal length (which causes distortion at wide-angle), the pose, etc. that contributes to the person looking a certain way. Photoshop is in fact not the real culprit most of the time. I'm a professional photographer and art director so I know how easily you can make someone not look like themselves or simply unnatural without ever having booted up the computer and Photoshop. But to be able to deconstruct what is wrong with specific photos would require expert knowledge so unfortunately, this is not something the average fan will be able to learn. But at least stop just defaulting to Photoshop for everything you don't like about a photo you see. 

""So-and-So company is doing So-and-So dirty by keeping them in the dungeon and giving them more comebacks"" - Operating multi-million dollar businesses is complex. There are a multitude of various factors that could contribute to an artist or group to be ""in the dungeon."" 1) It's no longer lucrative to spend money and time on that artist/group--or at least compared to other artists/groups that are better money-makers for the company. They'd rather invest in something that's sure to make more money. 2) The artist/group's relationship with the company has deteriorated (personal or business) 3) Creative differences 4) Mental illness or general emotional/psychological issues, or physical problems 5) Members of the group are doing well with solo activities and collectively makes more money than as a group. 6) Creative block. Unable to find suitable songs for the artist/group. 7) Artist/members prefers doing other things besides doing music. 

Bottom line is this: Companies want to make money, and almost all their decisions are based on how much money they can make off of their artists/groups. If there's no comeback, then there's something wrong that can't be taken care of easily, otherwise the company would already be happily making money off of that artist/group. Just because you don't know what the problems might be, doesn't mean the company is being unreasonable or stupid or treating the artist/groups unfairly. 

""So-and-So artist/group has spent 'this' much money on the expensive clothing/accessories alone for this new comeback."" - Companies sometimes have agreements/deals with expensive fashion brands. The artists/idols are like free advertising for Gucci, Prada, and whatever other big brands, and sometimes if the artist/group is famous enough, they get to wear those expensive clothes for free, and they basically advertise for those brands. This happens constantly in the entertainment industry, where actors, singers, and other celebrities get to wear/use expensive stuff for free, such as some famous actress wearing expensive dress or jewelry to the Academy Awards for free. 

""The filters they used in the MV."" - In videography/cinematography, the correct term is ""color grading,"" where they use video editing software to alter the colors balance, brightness, contrast, and other tweaks to achieve a specific aesthetic. The average person's understanding of ""filters"" is basically Instagram preset filters where you slap on a filter someone else made to alter how your photos look. Color grading is far more involved and requires a lot of expertise (and sometimes when the person sucks at it, we can tell--we see this often in nugu MVs). But there are other physical filters used in photography such as neutral-density filters, graduated filters, polarizer filters, etc., and they all alter how photos look. 

""This song ripped off this other song."" - In many cases, these comments are made out of ignorance about musical genres and their obvious characteristics. Generally speaking instrumentation/arrangement cannot be copyrighted--only melodies and lyrics (unless entire snippets of someone else's music is being sampled, such as heard often in hip-hop). Just because a song is in the reggae style does not mean it ripped off some other song you have heard that's also in the reggae style--they are simply in the same genre with similar or even identical instrumentation/arrangement. But as long as the melody and lyrics are different it's not a ripoff. 

""They give handheld mics to the better singers who have better control of their mic technique, while other members use headset mics"" - Today's live venue mixing engineer will have limiter and compressor on the signal chain, so there's no real need for ""mic technique,"" since you can go from a whisper to a shout without changing the mic's distance from your mouth and you will not cause clipping/distortion. 

It's also wrong that headset mics are ""inferior"" to handhelds. Good headset mics can cost close to $1,000 USD, while very popular handheld mics for live performances like the Shure SM58 is only about $100 USD.

These are just a few off the top of my head. What are some of the other ones you would like the average fan to understand/learn or stop making ignorant comments about?

- Jeongyeon of Twice. In Ooh-Aah, her short hair got me interested in them.
- Yeri stood out in Ice Cream cake. Since then, she's become the member that is the least interesting to me.
- Seungyeon of CLC. Just a hottie. Seems like I have a type because her and Jisoo have the same lips so I guess I like unusual, heart shaped lips?
- Jennie Kim of Blackpink. But since then, Jisoo is the visual IMO. 
- Kim Doyeon of IOI. In Very Very Very when they showed her face, I thought she had such an unusual look I read up on IOI, watched Produce 101, and they were probably my fave Kpop girl group for a while.

You can use any girl from kpop history and everyone is in their prime and the height of their popularity. You may have up to 9 members on your roster. 

Heres mine
  
**Main Vocal - Ailee** - Hands down the best vocalist of Kpop.
   
**Lead Vocal - Taeyeon, SNSD** - Great vocalist, a top tier visual.  and her popularity speaks for itself.
   
**Main Dancer - Momo, TWICE** - This was a hard decision. I was deciding between Chung Ha and Seulgi, but eventually went with Momo because of her international influence. Arguably the most popular Japanese Kpop idol, a strong visual, and a top 10 dancer. 
  
**Main Rapper - CL, 2ne1** - Top tier rapper and arguably the best idol known for her rapping. Incredibly famous, top tier stage presence, and a unique voice. 
  
**Lead Rapper - Jennie, BlackPink** - Great rapper, great visuals, top tier stage presence and star power. Great popularity. 
  
**Face of the Group - IU** - Not much to say here. She's IU. Who else would you rather have representing the group than one of the most notable figures in kpop
  
**Visual - Yoona, SNSD** - Hardest pick for me. After countless names I had it down to Jisoo, Suzy, and Yoona. Eventually went with Yoona as she is the textbook example of the Korean beauty standard. If I wanted to appeal to a more western audience I would have went with Suzy. 
   
**Leader - Irene, RV** - With a team of popular figures and lots of egos, a great leader is key. Irene leads seriously with no nonsense. She knows how to handle egos. Besides leading by force she leads as a kind mother. She is incredibly humble. And as a strong feminist she is also a strong female figure. Top tier visual, great dancer, Insanely popular. 
  
**Variety - Hani, Exid** - Hilarious and relatable. Variety queen

I'm female and I'm a little older than many of the groups promoting nowadays (I'm about Super Junior/Big Bang's age), and while I do fancy some of the younger people, there are some who I either just don't see that way or they're way too young for me to even look at and it would be weird/creepy. Still, I count them as biases because they're my favorites in particular groups; I just wonder about their welfare more than I think about them in any stereotypically 'fangirl' way. Do you have biases you see more as like, wanting to take care of them than ogle them? 

Mine:

* Pentagon's Yuto and Kino. They're both such handsome, talented kids, but I also just want to like, feed them soup and ask them about their day. 
* IKON's Junhwe. He's such a sassy little bastard, but at the same time, I see him look exhausted sometimes and I'm like ""Let me have a talk with your management, you are clearly not getting enough sleep young man.""
* Wanna One's Daehwi. I just cannot with how cute and funny he is. I must protect him. XD
* Monsta X's IM. He acts so much older than his age, and is so worldly and well-spoken that sometimes I forget that he's still really young. There are times I catch myself thinking boy, you had better sleep. 
* OHMYGIRL's Binnie. She was a child actress and she's seen a lot in the entertainment industry, but she's still so young and sometimes she looks so weary. I want to sit her down sometimes and just tell her to talk to me. 
* NCT's Lucas. I know a lot of people fancy him a lot, and let's be real he can act like a total fuckboy, but he's (1) way too young for me and (2) there are sometimes he just looks so *sad*. I watched the Seoul tourism thing he and other NCT members did and the bit about him missing his mom in Thailand just made me want to give him a hug. He strikes me as a kid who acts hard or even vain in order to cover up insecurities (I could be wrong of course, just that's how he comes off to me). 
* Dreamcatcher's Handong. She's the only Chinese member in her group and while her members love her, there are times she won't get a joke or something and I just want to tell her it's ok, because there are times I don't understand things either. ",6,0

[**Baek Chung Kang Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_baekck_01/)

* Date Project Ends: September 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Baek Chung Kang?

Baek Chung Kang is a soloist signed to Roa Media. He is most popularly known for being the winner of MBC's ""Star Audition - The Great Birth"" first season in 2011. His first album, *All Night* [(with accompanying title track)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1QRrNu1Gls) was released in 2012. However, soon after, he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and took a 2 year hiatus in order to get treatment.  Thankfully, he was able to beat the disease and returned to promoting in 2014.

His most recent comeback was in 2016 with the song ""[Bomb Di Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VgTanc2i3E)"". He also had a notable stint on [*King of the Masked Singer* in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liuMIZ2swSY) where he confused the judges due to his high range to the point where they thought he was a female idol before he was unmasked.

&amp;#x200B;

[**MONT Music Video Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mont_02/)

* Date Project Ends: September 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MONT?

MONT is a three member boy group signed to FM Entertainment. They officially debuted on May 18, 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-aXAJR60Y)"".  Their fandom name is MINT.

Their most recent comeback was with the release of their 1st mini-album *#date* in March 2018, though it was not promoted through traditional channels. The group instead opted to tour internationally to promote the album.

The group became popularly known due to their audition on the YG show *MIXNINE* due to having their label be situated in the middle of the woods in the country (and due to their CEO stating she used to sell kimbap). The group gave a [very polished audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9kFEv-Wbs) that impressed YG and passed all 3 MONT boys.

The boys did relatively decent while on the show if you take into account no one had heard of them prior to *MIXNINE*. All three were eventually eliminated prior to the finals, with Sangyeon (Bitsaeon) and Joongmin (Roda) being eliminated during the 1st round of cuts and Hyunwoo (Narachan) being cut during the second round of eliminations.

They have an active [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/montlove1/) and [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/montlove1/) as well. They previously ran a [very successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mont_01/) for their first mini-album, reaching \~230% above their initial goal.

&amp;#x200B;

[**14U Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u_02/)

* Date Project Ends: October 1, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU)"".

The group previously ran a successful Makestar for their last comeback, ""[Don't Be Pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSPGFCv4BTA)"", which was released on January 31, 2018.  Their [Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u/) was extremely successful, grossing 976.82% above BG Ent.'s initial goal.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Hash Tag Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hashtag_01/)

* Date Project Ends: October 10, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Hash Tag?

Hash Tag is a seven member girl group signed to Luk Factory. They debuted in October 2017 with the song ""[Hue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlYtS-fXKnk)"". They are notably produced by former Baby V.O.X member Kan Mi Youn.

There's not too much written about them in English outside the typical idol facts, but some notable things include:

I actually even enjoy watching my favorite idol group(twice) getting shipped to other celebrities/artists/personalities(even if Momo-Hechul was fake i still liked watching it)

I don't think the issue about dating is none-productivity either cause high functioning individuals who date usually don't have issues in their work.

So i wonder what is the widespread no-dating policy is about and why it seems a big deal to fans when they break it. To quote a great internet comment ""they are hawt they should be getting some themselves"" (ok this may not exactly be the same quote but i read from it a long time ago from some random reddit comment lol)

&amp;nbsp;

As you might have gathered from the end of our [Song of the Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7eLVtLsncE) MV, r/kpop sings is planning to comeback with an **EXTRA SPOOKY** Halloween release!!!

As you might have gathered from a calendar, Halloween is **only a few weeks away**, so we've expedited the process a bit in order to make sure we'll be able to get this done in time for a Halloween release. After this quick special release, we'll go back to the normal system for all future releases; our team just really loves getting spooky and wanted to make sure we had something to release. 

&amp;nbsp;

----


Now if you clicked that link and saw the options, you'll notice some things are different for this round:

**1. No Nomination Period** 

Wasting a whole week+ on nominations is a luxury we don't have time for - it actually takes me ages to go through and consolidate all the weird typos and redundancies since our collective reading comprehension and typing skills are that of a third grader, so instead we have:

**2. Pre-selected Song Options**

We're still alternating boy/girl groups, so our team sat down and went through multiple Halloween songs and videos and identified the 7 best options by boy groups.  ""Best"" in this instance means it needed to be the following: an iconically spooky song and video with a high quality and usable instrumental available. We only picked one song per artist in order to avoid splitting a vote. I know that'll somehow still be hard to understand for some of yall, so if you're offended by your faves not being included, go ahead and assume it's because I *personally* hate you and your oppas. 

**3. Shortened Voting Period**

You have until Saturday, September 22nd at whatever time I wake up to vote. If you want to extend that time, buy me drinks on Friday so I need to sleep in. I'll post the gofundme in the comments.

**4. You Can Only Vote Once**

This means the form requires a google sign in, sorry. 

**5. (Slightly) Shortened Submission Time**

This submission time will ONLY be one week, without the cute extensions I keep accidentally having to do because I haven't had time to sing myself. It'll probably be from the 24th - 1st. *Probably*.

**6. My temper is shorter**

Hopefully self-explanatory. If it helps you stay in theme, imagine me as a *cool spooky witch* trying to herd cats who can't read.

&amp;nbsp;

As always, thanks to the mods, our amazing team, everyone who's contributed and the community for being so enthusiastic. We can't wait to get [spooky](https://imgur.com/a/BzCsVZg) with you.

Was just curious if anyone else did any gos through @sarahkurosagi on twitter and are STILL waiting for their items almost a year now or over a year now. A lot of us have come forward and it's the waiting game for most of us. Not hearing anything back through emails or just straight up not getting our items. Anytime someone tries to reach out to her, we get ignored or unlawfully denied our items and refunded for ""hurting her feelings"". She claims she was in the hospital all of march and was unable to do anyone's orders. It has been recently discovered she flew out of country to see BTS twice, but is claiming her health is so bad she can't handle being responsible and doing our gos. Her friends are defending her saying she's saved up and worked hard to get healthy enough to go to these shows back in march. The tour wasn't announced until may. Something isn't adding up here and they are toying with people's money and merchandise. She's been sitting on other people's property for months now. Some of us even question if she used the money she got from people for the gos to be able to see bts twice and afford all of that and now can only send out people's stuff when she personally can afford it. Either way what she is doing is wrong. The money and the merchandise aren't legally her's to do whatever she wants with. Avoid doing gos through her at all costs. ",5,2

There are a couple of exceptions (bobs, longer hair on guys etc), and these days, the mullet has been in a couple of boy groups. 

What hairstyles would you like to see on people from groups you're interested in? Or just anyone really.

Since we've gotten almost *ALL* possible styles from Seventeen's Jeonghan at this point, I would love to see him with a reaaallly low haircut. Something like what Key has. Or maybe even as shaved as Day6's SungJin (that haircut has on me so much after the initial shock )

I think I'd also like to see Nu'est's Ren with really short hair as well, because I was thinking he and key have similar facial features.

1598,2018-09-19,2018,9,19,22,9h5cqo,"What do you think your favorite groups' concept/style would eventually be like? (or any group or artist in mind, really)",Fakayana,1537365336,"I've noticed that this year has quite a few major concept changes by long-running groups. Most notably Apink with ""I'm so sick"" and Oh My Girl with ""Remember Me"". NCT 127 also had ""Touch"" and NCT Dream recently had ""We Go Up"", quite opposite of what they usually release respectively (especially with 127).

And those are just the ones that had major changes on one comeback. Other groups change little by little on each comeback, to eventually have something completely different from their debut. WJSN's recent MV, for example, has them starting to experiment with something more girl crush. Mamamoo is still a vocal powerhouse but they're branching into new kinds of sounds.

Oh, and by ""concept"" I don't just mean ""cute vs powerful"" or their musical styles, it can also be anything about the group/artist itself! For example, I could see NCT eventually being organized into eras if SM is really going all in on that ""infinite members"". I'd like to see LOONA going full circle by releasing a solo for each month in the member's reverse order for their finale, before officially letting go the members to pursue their solo careers.

And as a final example, I *really* hope gugudan could eventually inherit VIXX's concept. They've shown that they can [cover the dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eRNZ0K3nQg) and their [singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OxGEzaXPoI) is top notch as a group (just go do it Jellyfish!)",24,37

I wanted to share a neat project I started back in January of this year with you all. It's a Melon Digital Chart database for all of active K-pop Girl Groups.

Database Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6hR07repu-8FxxXEPU6nLevrdhMHMlMPiFuQDefRA0/edit#gid=1982776988

I started this project because I realized that it was often difficult for us overseas Kpop fans to gauge how our favorite groups were doing in Korea. We have access to stats like Youtube views and Hanteo sales, but big numbers can be misleading, and for less popular groups it was not always helpful.

Questions like ""How do I know my group's being noticed in Korea?"", When will they get their first win?"", ""Did they grow in popularity since the last comeback?"" were often difficult to gauge as international fans.

I picked Melon as it is #1 music service in Korea, and although not perfect, over time it has proven itself to be one of the strongest tools in Kpop to gauge public reception and growth.

And so after couple months of development using custom-made scripts, I have successfully logged and charted daily ranks of all girl group title tracks (and a few solo tracks) released in 2018. The logs expand beyond to Daily Top 1000 ranks, which include a large portion of relevant girl groups. The charts are built interactive, so you can follow instructions to create your own filters and view only certain groups or by your custom criteria.

And as written in disclaimer, groups are split into Major &amp; Minor categories for easier data visualization.

I found few old posts about this on this subreddit but things might have changed since then. I live in Sweden and we recently got a new law that puts 10 fee on every import package + % of its total cost if the package have been sent from outside Europe. I bought few albums from ebay and did the mistake not buying from same seller so I had to pay 15 extra per album since the albums are shipped from outside Europe.

I've found few shops in EU (france,UK) but they dont have same amount of albums and their prices are bit higher. I dont know if there's a country in EU that have (free import) or at least cheaper than Sweden that have like a mail forwarding service to use. Or if I should try order from same seller and pay the fee once. 

Any help would be appreciated

None of my friends are into Day6 or Kpop for that matter and I was wondering if I should just attend the concert alone if I can. 


Im quite anxious going alone and I dont want to drag my friends if they arent going to enjoy and at the same time I dont want to miss out on seeing them perform. 


I am sure there are people whove gone for kpop concerts alone and I was wondering how the experience was. I feel like Im thinking too much because I am probably just going to be focused on them performing rather than the people next to me but Im quite a reserved person so I am not fully convinced if Im going to start making friends with people in the queue and so on!

Expanding this to a general topic, if an artist was kicked out of their company or left on their own  accord, where would you want them to go? Would you want them to go independent or sign with a company with better creative control, management, etc.? Is there anyone you would want them to ""rescue""? 

Even if their contracts aren't terminated, Huyna and E'Dawn need to leave. Other than them, all of TS's groups need to jump ship, same with DIA and MBK, and Park Jimin needs to go to a Starship-type company with better management and promotion. ",2,0

I feel like there are lines that say (translated) i love you, i console you. Also a distinct lines that sound like ""ta ta ta geoul seo."" Also I guess, a distinct ""oppa ya"" sound as she sings.

K-pop titan BTS will make a three-minute speech supporting UNICEF's fresh youth agenda, ""Generation Unlimited,"" on Sept. 24 at the Trusteeship Council Chamber of the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The team also will stage a gig.   
It is the first time that a K-pop group has spoken at the U.N. headquarters. In November 2017, Korean figure skater Kim Yun-a spoke at the U.N. about the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.   
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will participate in the BTS event.  
""Generation Unlimited"" is a global partnership to create opportunities and boost investments for children and those aged between 10 and 24.   
BTS also has been involved in the ""LOVE MYSELF"" project, which had raised 1 billion won ($891,000) as of June 2018. It was reported that the money would go to UNICEF for a campaign to eradicate violence against children around the world over two years.   
The group is on a world tour after releasing its latest album ""LOVE YOURSELF  'Answer'"" on Aug. 24.

The Korean Chuseok holiday  the three-day harvest festival to be celebrated from Sept. 23 to 25 this year  is when most Koreans visit their families or hometowns. Some K-pop idols, who normally overwork themselves on tight schedules, will take some time to spend with their families and relax, while others will continue with their relentless schedules.A handful of popular K-pop idols  TWICE, BLACKPINK, Sunmi and Monsta X  will take a break during the Chuseok holiday. The nine-member K-pop group TWICE doesn't have an official schedule planned during the holiday. But they might find the time to get together and practice for their first Arena Tour 2018 ""BDZ"" scheduled to start in Japan Sept. 2

&amp;#x200B;

BLACKPINK, the K-pop girl group fastest to reach the milestone of 400 million views on YouTube as of Sept. 21, with their ""As If It's Your Last"" music video, will also enjoy family time during the holiday. After taking a break, they will prepare for their first solo concert ""BLACKPINK 2018 TOUR \[IN YOUR AREA\] SEOUL X BC CARD"" scheduled for Nov.10 and 11 at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul.   
Sunmi, who was taken to hospital due to dizziness during the recording of ""Music Bank"" on Sept. 14, has work scheduled in Los Angeles on the Chuseok holiday, but plans on resting for the next two days. Scheduled to perform on KCON 2018 Thailand on Sept. 29, she will spend time practicing.   
K-pop boy band Monsta X, who recently wrapped up their promotional activities for their fourth single ""LIVIN' IT UP"" in Japan, will take a full break during Chuseok. ""Their schedules have been cleared for them to take a break and recharge themselves,"" a Starship Entertainment official said.  
But global K-pop boy bands GOT7 and BTS will still be busy during the holiday.   
GOT7, who recently made a comeback with their third studio album ""Present: YOU,"" will be busy promoting their new album and holding a fan signing event.   
According to local media reports, BTS is scheduled to make a three-minute speech at the United Nations.  
The K-pop act will attend a ceremony for Generation Unlimited, a new global partnership by the United Nations Children's Fund on Monday at the U.N. headquarters in New York, a day before the 73rd session of the U.N. General Assembly begins.   
While in New York, BTS will also appear on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" on Sept. 25 and ""Good Morning America"" on Sept. 26. They will then hold Tri-State Area concerts at New Jersey's Prudential Center on Sept. 28 and 29.",6,14
1815,2018-09-21,2018,9,21,22,9hpujx,Video of GOT7's Jackson telling off man after he pushed a fan goes viral,bluubear,1537536367,"Video: https://twitter.com/0328stagram/status/1042980695432298498

In the video a man pushes the girl holding an umbrella for Jackson from the back. [Allegedly](https://twitter.com/0328stagram/status/1043049818807984129), the man was a photographer who couldn't get a photo of Jackson due to the umbrella prompting him to push the girl quite aggressively. 

Jackson tells the man as he continues to walk,  **""Excuse me, you should not push girls""** and at the very end stops to directly say to the man, **""From now on, do not push girls, understand?""** before GOT7's manager turns him away and he and Jinyoung walk away.

If anyone is curious to why a fan is holding an umbrella for Jackson, [Jinyoung and Jackson came out of the car for a break](https://twitter.com/0328stagram/status/1042976517116940289) but it was raining so a fan holds an umbrella for him, at the beginning you can see him saying that it's okay he can hold it right before the girl is pushed. 


This has gone viral with several articles coming out detailing the incident. The video has amassed over half a million views in just 8 hours.

WEKI MEKI FIGHTING!


_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened Weki Meki ""Kiss, Kicks"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

1.  Who is your bias and why?

2.  What is something unique to Weki Meki that you enjoy? If you want, feel free to share examples/clips to support your answer!

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the Dreamcatcher discord or the .Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

*I want to note that Australia is unfortunately on the watch list for being restricted for entry because Amazon has stopped delivering to Australia after introducing Amazon.au (which has far less Kpop album stock).  I am testing the waters on a 2nd supplier for Australian winners in the Dreamcatcher and this giveaway, so we will see how smoothly that goes.  Hopefully I don't need to put in that restriction in the future, but I am just giving the heads up.  You may still enter this giveaway if from Australia.*

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2 giveaways.**

I was just curious as to how many of us on this subreddit actually met and converse with an idol/s before? Were they everything you imagined them to be? Did you actually try to have a conversation with them or were you too star struck to say anything? 

Getting pulled up on the KCON stage and meeting Twice was mind blowing to me. I was too shocked to saying anything to Jihyo when she tried to talk to me during the water bottle game. But she was so cool and super nice trying to calm me down and make me practice flipping the bottle. Seeing all of them in person was literally the best day of my life and I think about it non stop.

So do any of you guys have similar experiences??",155,233

I understand the artist bit, but not the rapper bit, since I think there are way better rappers within kpop, like T.O.P, Zico, RM and Bobby.
The moment I mention the idea of g-dragon not being a great rapper, I get replies saying I know anything about hip-hop and rap.

I don't see a specific standout quality apart from the fact that his voice is unique and his cadence is good
(I know he's rapped for a very long time but I still don't see anything extremely special)

A new season of Produce 101/Produce 48 is announced and the company is sending all of the members.

What would go down? Who would probably make it in? Who'd get evil edited? Which class would they end up going to? Who's probably going to get Jonghyuned and Samueled? etc. Think of all possibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll just do a quick one for Stray Kids: I think all of 3Racha is probably going to end up in A class. Hyunjin is going to get praised nonstop for his visuals. Jeongin has a good chance of ending up in D-F class in the first episode because he lacks the confidence (Bae Jinyoung's situation perhap?) and messes up the chance to make a good first impression but he improves later on and steals the Noona's hearts. Felix, Lee Know, Woojin, Seungmin and Hyunjin can end up anywhere around A-C class, but I don't think any of them would be placed lower. Chan might not be a lot of people's #1, but he's always in their list as a lot of people sees potential in him to lead the debuting group. Hyunjin and Chan has the highest chance of making it in, but Changbin is a shoo-in because his rap skill is just outta this world. And Jeongin can be a surprise too. ",125,108

Currently, we know these trainees are part of SM: Koeun, Hina, Lami, Ning Ning, and Jungyeon - personally, I cant figure out what sound &amp; image these girls will make as a group. Plus, I imagine a couple girls who arent in SMROOKIES will come along for debut without being introduced (like Joy from RV).

What do yall think? Lets share about these:
1) When do yall think SM will debut them?
2) How many members will there be? (Personally with NCTs success its not impossible to hope for NCTs sister group)

Why dyou think so and could they pass as family?

For me a few are (but not limited to): 

Han ChoWon (PD48) and Shownu (Monsta X): I f.  eel they both have that rapper look when you first see them but they're both vocalists. Both also have darker skin and arent typically skinny. 

Johnny (NCT) and (PD48) Shin SuHyun: Honestly, this needs no explanation. 

Hoshi (SVT) and SeungYeon/Luizy (Uniq/Mola): I think its the 10:10 effect here. Together with Yoon ShiYoon (he's not in Kpop but) the effect is *strong*. 

*Coughs* *Sungjin and Bob the Builder* *Coughs*

I woukd like to hear (rather than see because it'd be nicer for them to genuinely interact with each other) JaeHyun (NCT) and DK (SVT) go on a playdate. I think it would be delightfully awkward (at the very least at the beginning) unless SeokMin has gotten over his awe of Jaehyun.

I'm new on reddit, and really hoping you can help me!

I travelled to Vietnam last year and on my way to Ph Quc I saw a videoclip of a song, which by the looks of it I assume it was K-Pop. My friends and I have been obsessed trying to find it but haven't had any luck yet :(. Can you help? Plot of the videoclip goes like this:

It was a woman singing, young, light skin. 

The story was about a blind girl that played piano. She met a guy and they fell in love. 

We then discover that the guy is actually married, but the wife is a not a nice person. The wife discovers his affair and plans a revenge. 

She invites the blind girl who doesn't know he is married to play piano in their house, while they are having dinner. He is shocked when he sees the girl, and the wife smiles because her revenge worked. 

The blind girl finds out about all of this and leaves crying, the wife smiles and leaves him all alone.

Does this ring a bell to anyone? Let me know, you will be making me and my friends very happy!!!

Thanks,

**""Distance"" by CLC** 

I have to admit that at the first listen of the Black Dress album I loved the title song just a bit more than this B side track. However I probably played ""Black Dress a bit too much, and it eventually became old pretty quick. Since that happened this song has become my favorite song on the album. To be honest I never thought that the song would ever get a music video, but it did and it's really well produced. The whole mature concept for this song is something I would like to see more within the industry, and it seems to suit the girls really well. Another thing to add is that this song reminds me of their previous song ""Where are You ?"".

**""Secret Garden"" by Oh My Girl** 

Oh My Girl is one of my new absolute favorite girl groups out there right now because their vocals just know how to make me feel calm. When I saw that this song was among the few that were released early this year I knew that this year was going to be great for Kpop as a whole. It's has been over 5 months ago since the song came out, and I still love playing it over and over again. I think the reason why this is their best title track yet is the fact that there is not a rap anywhere to be found in the song. A song doesn't necessarily need a rap for it to be good and this is great example of that statement.

**""Paint Me"" by Mamamoo**

In my personal opinion I always believed that these girls were always great from the start of their carrer, but of course not everyone sees them that way. For those whose are concerned about the controversy they are known for I'm fully aware of it. I don't condone them for what they did but I still enjoy their music along with fully knowing that they are capable of learning their lesson. Anyways back to mentioning the song, I like what they are doing with their image. For the lonest time most of the songs they did had a retro vibe to it and I loved that they had made that apart of their whole concept. However, I respect their choice to change their image and branch out to other concepts and genres. This song is a great start for a new beginning for the group and I fully believe that their carrer will continue to be successful.

**""Good Evening"" &amp; ""I Want You"" by SHINee**

I have been a fan of several groups over the last 6 years, but my love for SHINee has always been consistent. Every single song that they ever produced was outstanding in my eyes making me believe that these men could never do anything wrong. When Jonghyun committed suicide last year a part of me was feeling that they would go on a long hiatus in order to recover from the tragic loss of their fellow group member. Despite losing an angel, they probably felt the best way to honor their friend was to keep on singing even though he was no longer with them physically. When I heard that SHINee was going to have a comeback in late May I was super excited. The music video finally released and I was pleased once again with their amazing vocals. At first I thought that was the only song they were going to come out with but then they dropped their second mini album for the year only a few weeks later. However that is not the end of it because they are going to release part 3 really soon. Both main title tracks from part 1 &amp; 2 are complete jams and I cant get enough of either song. Of course these guys really know how to adapt to the current sound because both songs suit them so well and doesn't make it seem like they are trying hard. 

**""Only One You Need"" by Jonghyun**

The fact that SM Entertainment still released Jonghyun's last album is really touching. Jonghyun meant a lot to so many people especially to his fellow group members. Among all of the members he surely did have a unique voice which lead him to have a successful solo carrer separate to his carrer with SHINee. It was sad to hear that he left us but this entire album was like a big thank you for all the fans supporting his work. I picked this song in particular because of the lyrics ""I wanna be the only one you need"". Songs like ""Shinin"" and ""Before Our Spring"" of course are dedicated Shawols in general but this song is more dedicated to Shawols individually. 

**""Lazy"" by EXO - CBX**

To be completely honest I am not the biggest fan of EXO as a whole but for some reason I am a big fan of the sub unit EXO-CBX. The main reason why I love the sub unit so much is that my bias from the group, Xiumin, has more opportunities to shine and show off his voice. With their new mini album I think it's unique how each of the songs are themed around each day of the week. This song in particular is mentioning about a Lazy Sunday and how being ""simple is sexy baby woah"". In general this song is so relaxing and peaceful and I have to say this is the best song on the album.

**""One Shot Two Shot"" by BoA**

People seem to be always contemplating who the real Queen(s) of Kpop is/are. Some people say that is Twice, 2NE1, IU, or Ailee, but in my opinion I believe the real queen of the genre is BoA. She has been in the industry for over 15 years and officially started her carrer in 2001. Now I like the other artists that I mentioned however she just has a special place in my heart as a solo artist. I always found her music to be so upbeat that it makes me wanna dance to it. This song was no exception because the background music is so much fun to listen to, and when I watched the music video it made me want to learn the choreography.

**""Go Away"" by Jun Hyung Yong**

Highlight is another group that I don't really stan but I don't mind their music every once in a while. Despite the fact I actually don't mind some of the members individually like Junhyung or Yoseob. This song truly introduced me to his voice and made me recognize how unique his voice is on his own. Overall the song is relatable and the lyrics portray the scenario about two people falling out of love accurately. Unfortunately this kind of situation happens sometimes, and it's good to have a songs to represent that. I think that having it be a upbeat kind of song helps give it a more positive outlook in general. 

**""Selfish"" by Moonbyul &amp; Seulgi**

When I heard that a couple of the members of Mamamoo were going to branch off and kickstart their solo careers I was completely ecstatic. Honestly I didn't expect Moonbyul to get a solo mini album because most people seem to talk about the other three girls more. Another thing I was excited to hear was that Seulgi from Red Velvet was going to be featured in the title track. I think this choice was pretty outstanding not only because she is really popular with in the fandom but also have a general interest with each other's music. Not to mention the music video is super cute and funny and it really shows how close they are as friends.

**""No More"" by UNI.T**

Where do I begin with this song? The way I found out about the song was on one of Kville Entertainment's videos. I honestly did not think I was going to like this song as much as I do. At first it sounds just like another average sexy concept song but after a couple of listens my opinion changed very quickly. Now every time I hear this song I automatically put it on repeat and can't get enough of it because of the killer vocals. Not every debut is unique and super special but I have to say this is an outstanding debut song for an underrated group. It's a shame that these girls have not been brought up in conversation within the Kpop community a whole lot because they are really talented with the potential to go big. 

**""Lost in the Dream"" by Monsta X** 

As much as I love title songs it often seems that a majority of the B side tracks are better. When Monsta X released this album I wasn't automatically sold on it because I wasn't completely sold with  Jealousy by itself. But of course I never like to judge an album just solely on the main song they decide to produce a music video for. This song stands out the most on the album because it sounds darker than a lot of other songs they recorded. I mean the intensity of the music alone really helps sets the feeling for this song but when it's paired the passionate vocals of the members it just becomes 10 times better. 

**""Jenga"" by Heize**

For the longest time I never really payed attention to Heize because her music never got me interested enough. Somehow I just watched the music video and I instantly liked it because the concept was really cool. The song sounds like something you would hear in an old timey jazz club which I think is such an underrated concept. Also in general this is one of those songs that you can listen too when you are trying to relax because her vocals are soft and peaceful. Now I am not 100% certain if I am going to stan her but if she makes more songs like this it's very likely that I will.

**""Love4eva"" by LOONA**

A lot of people of think that I only listen to Kpop but I still listen to Western artists, and one of those artists is Grimes. Her style of music is so eclectic and unique which is the main why I love her so much. Then the announcement came out that she was going to collaborate with Loona and I was suddenly overwhelmed. I couldn't have asked for anything better because this song is so outstanding and everything works so well. Honestly the techno music suits this specific sub unit of Loona and if one of the other two did the same thing it probably wouldn't work in my opinion.

**""Alone"" by Black6ix**

Ever since I saw the music video for the song ""Like a Flower"" I just was hooked on this group's music. They just debuted last year and they have 3 absolutely catchy title songs which need more appreciation. I've still yet to know all of their names but I can definitely tell there is a great amount of talent present. This song is a little different than the other two songs they are known for but it still a pure joy to listen to. Even though it is not really an official ballad it's a nice change to have a softer song in their collection. However there is only one thing that didn't really suit this comeback and that was the music video itself. It wasn't terrible but the production could have a lot better. Anyways if you going to give this song a chance listen to the song without the mv.

**""Scentist"" by VIXX**

My list wouldnt be complete without adding a song from the Concept Kings themselves. I always look forward to seeing what their next comeback will bring because I know I won't be disappointed with any concept they choose to do. This comeback along with last year's might have not been necessarily dark or edgy but it's because of their versatility that they earned their current title. What I like most about this concept is that they are portraying themselves as Aromachologists (googled this term) in order to recreate the beautiful scent that they experienced while meeting a lovely lady. 

**""Baby"" by The Rose**

K-Rock is a genre that I don't dwell upon that often because for the longest time I just had no interest in it. That all changed when I discovered CNBLUE and my curiosity peaked for the genre. However they were the real K band that I cared about for a while until I discovered the boys from The Rose. Something about them reminded me about CNBLUE and I decided to see where they would go with their carrer. I am not fully apart of the fandom yet but if they keep impressing me like with this song I know I will become a loyal fan. One random part of the song that a lot of people seem to like that I also enjoy is where one of the members sings the lyrics ""Clouds are shrouding us into the dark"". Those lyrics are sung so beautifully that is what sold it for me. 

**""Broken"" by TVXQ**

I really can't help but mention the two gentlemen that make up this group because they are legendary. Since they both had been out of the military for some time I had really been looking forward for them to have a comeback and they definitely killed it. This non title track stood out to me because it's one of many songs that talk about the harsh reality of love. Love is not an easy thing to experience and songs like this need to exist because it's necessary to recognize both the good and bad. Even though the lyrics are really sad the melody is still really beautiful. Something ironic to note about this song is its placement after the track ""The Chance of Love"" which is an upbeat positive song.

**""You and I"" by Dreamcatcher**

Since I have been giving K-rock more of a chance these last few years I always wondered about a girl group who could be considered apart of the genre. Then Dreamcatcher debuted with their killer vocals and outstanding eerie concept. Unlike most K-bands these girls actually dance, and there is nothing wrong with that. To me this is their best song yet and is the song that introduced me to them. The way this song plays into their eerie concept is that the other girls are trying to rescue their fellow member from an evil spirit. Once the spirit has been released all of the girls are being chased by said spirit and are trying so hard to escape its presence. I personally love these darker story for music videos because it is a good change.

**""The Reason"" by Got7**

With Got7 being one of my of ultimate bias groups they hardly ever let me down when it comes down to their music. Despite this fact, I am going to say the truth by saying that this last album was not their strongest album. I still enjoy listening to it though because there are a few songs that make it worth listening to. This is the 3rd track on the album and being completely honest it's the best song. I love how you can tell each individual's passion when they're singing along with the emotional lyrics. Even though there is a little rap within the song it does not take away from the meaning the song portrays. ",2,2

1999,2018-09-24,2018,9,24,12,9iepb0,180922 - BTS concert in Hamilton,LPUAdit,1537760130,"So on the 22nd, I attended one of the BTS' 3 shows in Canada in Hamilton. I went with a friend of mine and while we had bought our tickets through Ticketmaster's resale, we had some pretty decent seats. When we entered the stadium after security and all that, there were such loud screams that could be heard and it was still an hour until the concert started lmao.

The screams were of course for the MVs that were playing on the screens. We bought $10 dollar popcorn and water and the popcorn was just terrible but I guess thats part of the ""stadium experience"". About 10-15 min before the 6pm start time, they played the DNA mv with some extra bright lighting and the volume increased much more. Then after was the Mic Drop remix mv and ohmygod, people lost their minds at just the mv haha. Fake Love was next and it was pretty much the same reaction,

Something I noticed was that DNA, Mic Drop remix and Fake Love got far louder screams than when Spring Day or the I Need U mv's were played.

The Fake Love mv ended exactly at 6 and the lights went dark. Pyro started to go off with the screens showing BTS dancing to this music and you could tell the hype was building up quickly. More pyro went off as the members came from under the stage and never did I think I would hear such loud screams as I did in that moment. My ears basically became muffled as if I was taking off in an airplane almost immediately and the screams were so loud, they themselves became muffled. That of course died down a little pretty quickly and you could hear the music pretty well.

What was great was while everyone was so loud, the music and the members could still be heard easily. The crowd would also quiet down certain moments like during Truth Untold. At first I thought I'd dislike the loud screaming but it was actually really cool. The energy and vibe in that stadium was something I had never experienced before. Everyone seemed like having the best time of their lives and dancing or jumping to songs and it was just amazing.

Some of my favourite performances were the Medley (Fun Boyz, Attack on Bangtan, Fire, Baepsae, Dope) and Outro: Tear. They were just crazy hype. People just kept on jumping through the medley - it was non stop. Listening to Fire live is alone worth the money spent on the tickets. When Tear started, all the lights became kind of green-ish and the audience singing ""You're my tear"" in the chorus while going crazy was just awesome. All the individual songs were excellent. All performances were really well done. Euphoria is definitely a fan favourite. RM's Love really involved the crowd during the end with BTS themselves coming out as well to dance at the end. JHope really gave off MJ vibes with his dancing on a platform wearing a white suit. The girls sitting in front of me were losing their minds during V's performance but tbf, so was my friend and me. The different instruments used really gave off a *more* sensual and R&amp;B vibe. Suga's was so entertaining and SeeSaw being one of my fav songs made it all much better. His dancing during the chorus is so nice and fits the song so well. The blue lighting of all the lightsticks really add to the atmosphere. Jimin's dance moves during Serendipity are actually insane. There's one part where he does this roll on the ground which transitions into this almost worm type move and you're just like how tf did he do that? Lastly, Jin absolutely killed it. Playing the piano in the beginning and then ballad rock style of the song really fits a concert. 

RM said before the end of the concert that they watched the footage after their first Hamilton concert on how to improve and it really shows throughout their tour. In the first performance at Seoul, some of the members struggled a little bit during Truth Untold but its really satisfying to see how much they have improved. That song was fantastic.

Overall, the concert was so much fun. The members gave it all their best with the audience doing the same. I've never been part of something of this atmosphere before. I have been to concerts in the past and while I still love those, this was just different. Like RM said, it really felt like a celebration. Oh and JHope sang a little bit of In Your Feelings (Drake) with the crowd singing along and it was really great.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Whether she will be in the Blackpink successor group or be a solo artist
2. Why did JYP release (or kick maybe) her

1's answer is more likely that she debuts solo because she is not in YG, but in The Black Label. She might be doing Sunmi stuff with Teddy. However, it is not entirely impossible that YG and Black Label will collaborate in the YG's new (fuck) survival show.

&amp;#x200B;

As for 2, some Korean newspapers have spotted that JYP mentioned something like ""JYP has its own standard... However talented the artist is, we don't go hand in hand with those who repeatedly violate this standard."" in his IG post three ds ago.

(note the wrong words, we are using the dictionary to translate to English the information we have obtained through the Chinese Weibo)

The unofficial fanface of the SR18G posted the information on a Korean forum called Naver. We are in an association.

\-----

Q&amp;A MiroCheng

***What is Ning Ning's situation?***

A: NingNing is in a bad position due to the image they want for the group

***When will the group debut?***

A: Probably at the beginning of the year. The song is ready and BoA was involved in the process.

***Which girls are you surprised to see them?***

A: Oh, NingNing is charming and shy. Lami likes to talk to strangers. The Japanese girl is funny and has two Koreans who are mature

***How many girls did you do the makeup on the day of the photo shoot?***

A: Probably five. There was an entire team in there.

***YiYang recently left. What do you think about?***

A: On the day of the photos she was accompanied by an interpreter. She was short on time. I did not do your makeup. She was one of the tallest and stayed in the background. You know, where you stood out the most.

***What about her getting kicked out of the company?***

A: I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

MiroCheng also said that she is not hired by SM. She got the job with SM because a friend of hers invited her. She said she has worked with DreamCatcher and that the photo session photographer is quite famous. Some information also says that the company intends to debut a large group. Between 8 to 12 girls. The photos that Miro released are not the girls, but the test that a textile company from Korea, responsible for the manufacture of the clothes, made available, so that they had a sense of the colors. The girls were dressed in white and pink.

At all times she played songs from Red Velvet, SES and Girls Generation on the spot. The use of cameras or tape recorders was prohibited. Miro also said that there were cameras on the scene recording the girls. The foreign girls seemed out of place. She thinks they must have recently joined the company's trainee system. That's all she knows.

I'm new on reddit, and really hoping you can help me!

I travelled to Vietnam last year and on my way to Ph Quc I saw a videoclip of a song, which by the looks of it I assume it was K-Pop. My friends and I have been obsessed trying to find it but haven't had any luck yet :(. Can you help? Plot of the videoclip goes like this:

It was a woman singing, young, light skin.

The story was about a blind girl that played piano. She met a guy and they fell in love.

We then discover that the guy is actually married, but the wife is a not a nice person. The wife discovers his affair and plans a revenge.

She invites the blind girl who doesn't know he is married to play piano in their house, while they are having dinner. He is shocked when he sees the girl, and the wife smiles because her revenge worked.

The blind girl finds out about all of this and leaves crying, the wife smiles and leaves him all alone.

Does this ring a bell to anyone? Let me know, you will be making me and my friends very happy!!!

Thanks,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been into k-pop since 2010, and while I actively listened to quite a few (MBLAQ, U-KISS, BAP, SNSD, f(x), etc) the only group I ever truly cared about, followed, and ever saw live was (is) SHINee. I'm sure you can understand me when I say I've been far, far away from the scene this year. Only today was I able to watch my boys in promotional videos and not get choked up. So I've been hesitant to dip my toes back in. But enough of the sadness!

I work a ful time job now and I don't have the same time to spazz that I had as a teen.

I think I stepped off the kpop train some time in 2017, and now I just watch it pass by ever so often. Occasionally, I buy a ticket and go for a ride when I have time.

I've been a fan for some time now and it's weird not to have it in my life so much now.

It never used to occur to me that some groups managers sat through vlives with them. But some groups look much more free.   

Does anyone know if they get told to do stuff like that (eg all the whole boy-pats-other-boys-but-at-a-concert)? Or do some of these things come genuinely from the artists themselves? 

And how are interviews conducted? They're rehearsed beforehand right? And vatiety shows? Does it work that way in the west too? ",118,83

Our elementary school has a week dedicated to showcasing different cultures.  One day is dedicated to Asian culture.  Many parents are bringing Asian foods and games to share.  I wanted to bring a TV to show kpop music videos that kids could  watch.  But I wanted to show kpop videos which would be age appropriate and wouldn't offend other parents.  

I've tried youtube, vimeo and others.  But the kpop videos I've found at least, aren't appropriate for kinders or 1st graders.  

Any help would be appreciated.",3,1

Some meant the only way for a group to be considered legendary is for the group to have been active for 10+ years/or to be know for said time period. Others had the opinion on that longevity did not matter for the term ""legendary"", but the achievements you made on kpop-history or for Korea in general do so e.g. groups such as EXO and BTS could be considered ""legendary"" even though they havent been active or known for 10ish years. 

I myself lean more toward the achievement-based criteria for the term, rather than the longevity-based criteria, however I would like to spark a discussion around it and ask what your personal belief on the topic is and if you have other criteria's than the ones mentioned.

I went to the Sunday GA concert for BTS in Hamilton and just thought I would share my experience.

I lined up Saturday night at around 8pm and got \~340 in the unofficial line. I left after getting it to go to bed in a hotel and came back the next morning at around 8AM. I got officially wristbanded at 10AM at \~355 (which means 15 people cut in line). Core Entertainment was really unorganized, and didnt even end up honoring the official wristbands by checking people as they went in, so I would say I ended up being around the 400th person in. 

I was third row, center left of the island/extended stage. It was really really close, like I got splashed by Jungkooks water, but the issue was from where we were nobody could see the main stage because of how its set up. It was also incredibly squishy where I was because the first two rows the people were like 58-510, and everyone in my row (third row) was 52 or under. So in our row and the rows behind us there was an extraordinary amount of squishing because we shorties were all trying to get that prime spot in between the heads of tall people so we could see. It got so bad at one point that I almost left and a girl behind me fainted.

In terms of the actual performance, if you have a chance to see BTS live, you absolutely should. They are absolutely, ineffably electric. Everyone works together really well but their individuality shines too. I think theyre even better looking in person by MILES, and I also liked a lot of their songs better live - I find that the recorded versions have too much autotune. Last thing, I noticed a lot of members just pause and stare in awe at the crowd, and they just came off really humble and genuine. I found it really heartwarming!

Individually, and I know I repeat myself a lot but I mean every word. Just getting the obvious out of the way - theyre all amazing dancers and singers and rappers. Below is just what I \*noticed\* the most about each individual.

1. Namjoon / RM - You can tell this guys the leader just because hes overflowing with kind of a.authoritative charisma.

2. Seokjin / Jin - My dudes, this man really is Worldwide Handsome. His solo stage really showed off how much his vocals improved. He didnt come to my section that much at all so I have less to say, but just that I never really loved his vocals until the concert (dont h8 me pls)

3. Yoongi / Suga - Hes kind of came off like he didnt give a fuck, and I dont meant this in a bad way, just his vibes. Hes the same as with his Vlives, I would say. he came to our section so I saw him a lot and hes just so cool.

4. Hoseok / Jhope - You know how everyone says you leave their concerts a jhope stan? This is 200000% true. Jhope without a doubt, left the biggest impact on me. The man is sunshine and joy and is just so genuine, but hes also got an unmistakable cool quality about the way he moves/raps. Jhope came our section a lot as well and yeah Im in love 

5. Jimin - Hes sSOsoOOoooo attractive in person I didnt really believe my eyes? Also the way he moves . you cant take your eyes off. Every move is very intentional and done w/ a lot of care, and it really showed.

6. Taehyung / V - Hes got the most mesmerizing face, in that you look at it and even though Ive seen it a lot, you never really get used to how attractive it is. Hes also very cool, came to our section a lot. Like in bangtan bombs he totally has a silly side, like hell be smoking hot one second and then just break out into adorably cheeky, ear to ear grins.

7. Jungkook - Everytime Jungkook smiled, I smiled. His smile has a quality I hadnt noticed before in videos, but it really opens his face up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus my phone's home and lock screen is kpop (currently my lock screen is OT18 NCT and my home screen is She Is Jonghyun) also anytime I'm just casually humming something it's a kpop song.

I've seen this thread on OH first and I thought it was interesting, so, what are your most memorable moments as a fan of Kpop? I think that the first year(s) are the ones we mostly remember and will probably look back with nostalgia glasses. Can be minor things like, a comeback from a small group that meant a lot to you, or your bias first drama that you watched every episode till the end, but you can remember pretty much how it was for you when it happened.

Mine probably are (I think it went pretty chronological lol):

MADE eps release

My first BTS comeback: hyyh pt2

My first kpop awards season (2015) (~~I still can't believe I was able to witness the last 2ne1 stage live~~)

2417,2018-09-30,2018,9,30,14,9k3u6y,My K-Pop podcast recommendations,Wolf_Puppy,1538285040,"Someone in another thread asked me for K-Pop podcast recommendations. I listen to them often (while driving, showering, working out), so I know all them quite well. I thought I should share my recommendations in a separate thread for those of you who might be interested. 

These are currently the best Kpop podcast (IMO) that are still releasing new episodes:

DaebakCast - Three dudes getting together to talk about new kpop releases, do album reviews, and discuss various topics related to kpop. They also cover a lot of K-indie stuff too. Their Discord server is the one I hang out at, because it's not too crowded where you can't even have any meaningful conversations with so many people chatting at once.

Kpop Unmuted - By far the most professional Kpop podcast. The tone of the discussions are more like professional radio shows where the guests are almost always people who write music reviews professionally for websites and magazines, or work in media/entertainment/publishing in some professional capacity. And of course they also happen to be big Kpop fans. They do reviews and discuss various Kpop-related topics.

Ask Me About Kpop - This is a really fun podcast where two best friends focus on a different topic related to Kpop and do a deep dive. They are really entertaining to listen to because the way they fangirl so hard is absolutely adorable and endearing (as opposed to being annoying), and they are also really articulate and humorous too. They tend to be more boy-group focused, but they do talk about girl groups too.

Unpretty Kpop - This is the lo-fi ghetto kpop podcast. It's also two friends talking about Kpop, and the sound quality used to be pretty shitty, but has improved recently (I've been helping them improve their audio with tips and instructions on how to master properly. When they gave their shout-out about it in recent episodes--that was me). The podcast is raw and unfiltered, just two friends talking very casually about Kpop, and they are absolutely hilarious to listen to.

There are other kpop podcasts, but they either discontinued, or I find them either too boring, or too shallow/ignorant/immature, or too pretentious. I have listened to every single Kpop podcast out there so if I didn't name one you know about, it's because I just don't like it or it's been discontinued.",24,141

As far as I know, Mamamoo started their ""4 Seasons Project"" with *Yellow Flower*, and that's for Spring season. Then, GFriend and BTS followed with their respective comebacks.

On Summer season, Mamamoo released *Red Moon* and again GFriend and BTS released another albums for this.

And for the Fall season, for sure Mamamoo is gonna release another album.

The reason why I made this because today SinB made an appearance in King of Mask Singer, and EVERY TIME a GFriend member goes to Mask Singer, there will be always a GFriend comeback ahead.

In Winter season as well, because every Buddy right now are very pumped for Winter comeback because of the hints that GFriend posted on their SNS accounts.

I don't know why their companies are doing this, or what is it for but I hope this ""plan"" goes out well for them.",3,0

I really like Jeong SeWoon's ""LaLa"" 

I don't stan him per say but I do have a sort of soft spot for him. 

B-side here basically refers to anything as long as its not a title track. So OSTs count too.
