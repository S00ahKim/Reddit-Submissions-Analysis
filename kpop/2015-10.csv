Hands down, my favourite month in K-Pop in 2011. Nine Muses came back stronger than ever and released their best song since their debut. Sunny Hill blessed us with the beautiful Pray. Chocolat and Stellar made their way onto the scene. T-ara solidified their position in the top tiers of Girl Groups. Super Junior released Sorry Sorry 3.5 and my brief love affair with G.Na started.

Dear god, I hope this works - I've never done tables on Reddit before...

Put the group name, a tad bit of info, and some of their discography. There's so many good groups around that aren't well known- and it's time to get them a couple more fans at least!

168,2015-10-3,2015,10,3,13,3nb51x,On iKon's debut and their slightly unfair subsequent demolishing of the charts,Caitstreet,1443845135,"Unpopular Opinion: I have to say that iKon's debut was quite average, the video for Rhythm Ta was pretty chill, like there were only a few simple sets and some random car seat shots 'like we in da hood', and to be honest it was a really typical boy band sort of debut. Matching costumes, dancing together in an oddly lit 2 dimensional set, occasional close-ups (you know what i mean). But hey, its their debut and maybe they need time to warm things up, who knows maybe next year they'll blow all our minds. I also understand that they (BI &amp; Bobby) write their own songs so it takes time for them to develop and hone this talent. However, for such a mediocre debut, we all know that they are going to take over all the music shows and come out top of the charts simply because they're more popular. I know this is somewhat of a larger issue but I think a lot of people, especially those veteran Kpop listeners have already brought up and that is that nowadays its more of a ""who has a bigger fandom?"" competition other than actual song and performance competition. To everyone else who has been working hard for a few years and have actually made a pretty great comeback recently only to be swamped by a more popular debut artist who had an okay debut is a pretty sad affair.
I'm not hating, in fact I LOVE iKon, they're one of my absolute favourites. Its just that seeing all these other amazing artists, who have just as much talent as iKon and arguably, better songs (eg: Seventeen also write their own songs, and no I'm not a follower of Seventeen) to be overlooked like that is unfair. And yes I'm well aware that this industry is like that but I also think that people shouldn't be disillusioned by a band's popularity as well. If iKON wanted to truly take the Kpop world by storm with their debut, they should have debuted with a BANG, not hold back at all, show everyone their amazing talents that we all know and love. But hey, that's just my opinion.

Edit: Okay so maybe its not that unpopular of an opinion after all. Sorry!",22,3

177,2015-10-3,2015,10,3,17,3nbqfl,[Discussion] Zhang Liyin and SM Entertainment: What went wrong?,HvDreamer,1443862365,"First off, I should probably introduce Zhang Liyin to those who do not know her.  

Zhang Liyin is Chinese singer who signed under SM Entertainment back in 2003.  Her debut garnered much attention from the public as it was made known that she was personally trained under Lee Soo Man.  She was also being touted as the ""Chinese BoA"" of SM Entertainment at the time, so you could imagine how big a deal she was.  

After three years of training, Zhang finally makes her official debut in 2006 with a cover of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini's ['Timeless'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubCz5VNv_o0).  Despite being a cover, the song was met with positive results.  The public recognized her vocal talent, and her debut song charted high on Korean music charts.  Though, I think one could argue that the success of her debut was largely due to the featuring of Junsu and cameos of Super Junior members.  Nevertheless, 'Timeless' was hardly a failure and her future music releases continued to do well.  

In the following year, Zhang came back with a R&amp;B song ['Y (Why...)'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKcPmINR7s).  The MV of the song was also complemented with a [Documentary version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9YodPX3o0) that showcases the hardships she had to go through (Note: I recommend watching it).  This single was soon followed by a series of popular ballads, a full album, and the beginnings of her Chinese promotions.  It was also in this period that we start to see Zhang do dance oriented songs, so as to live up to her ""Chinese BoA"" title.  

* Here's a rare fancam of her dancing with a man to which she refers to as her Korean dancing partner:  [**x**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZEkid-QwZ8)

* And here's Zhang performing 'One More Try' at SMTOWN in Bangkok 2009:  [**x**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjN9qZ9fUmU)

^ Nothing special, but do take note of the loud fan chants during her dance solo.  While not a good measure of how popular she was back then, it can serve as a testament to her increasing popularity at the time.  *Well*... not really.  But there's no denying that the audience liked her performance.  

In any case, by the end of 2009, it was revealed that Zhang Liyin was going to prepare for her second full length album.  *AND* then the worst happens.  For no apparent reason, SM just gave up on promoting Zhang Liyin and the release of her album was delayed indefinitely.  It was only after 5 years that we finally see her official return to the music scene.  I repeat:  **5 years.**  She is now 26 years old just in case you were wondering.  But yea, just try to imagine how it would feel to get into one of the best entertainment companies with dreams of becoming a superstar only to realize years later that it will ruin your opportunities to achieve that.  I don't know.  I'm most likely blowing things out of proportion, but sometimes I wonder how different things would be for her if not for the ""break"" she was given.  

**So to this end, I would like to ask those who care about this to talk about what you think led up to her 5 year hiatus?  What went wrong between them?**

Here is an interview where Zhang Liyin talks about what she went through during those 5 years:  [**x**](http://chocolyn.org/forums/topic/413-zhang-liyin-sm-has-never-given-up-on-me/).  

^ This doesn't necessarily reveal what really happened, but it does show how strong her passion in music is.  

I don't expect to get many responses for this, but at the very least, I hope this would show people who is Zhang Liyin.  I also feel like she doesn't get enough love on this subreddit.  I suppose if you don't have an answer to the question I proposed, then maybe you can use this time to listen to her music and share your thoughts about her in general.

Also, if you'd like to learn more about Zhang Liyin, then I recommend that you try visiting the [Chocolyn forums](http://chocolyn.org/forums/) and [their tumblr site](http://chocolyn.tumblr.com/).  There's also a great selection of Zhang Liyin related videos and interviews to watch on their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz1DSSzCEjvoRCwDsdORJ8A).",25,69

Note that they are merely closing down the [*fansite*](http://visualglow.com/).  The people who managed it will continue to support Rainbow, but as regular fans.

Their Korean/English translator, Sunny, will continue translate for Rainbow through the following twitter account: [@vg_trans](https://twitter.com/vg_trans)

It's sad that they have come down to this decision since the site was a great source of all Rainbow related content, but it's easy to understand the reasons behind it as detailed in the announcement.  There's also [this post](http://gall.dcinside.com/board/view/?id=rainbow&amp;no=1124681) from the owner of Visual Glow made on dcinside regarding the current state of the international Rainbow fandom.

Lastly, I would like to end this post with 2 translated quotes from Yoon Hye and Jisook:

&gt; ""There are no current plans for a new album for Rainbow, ***but there is also no way Rainbow will ever disband.***"" - Yoon Hye / Cr. [VisualGlow](https://twitter.com/VisualGlow)

Just thought I'd let everyone know that there's a Chinese music streaming service called [edit: netease is it's english name](http://music.163.com) that seems to have a lot of kpop/jpop/cpop/whatever music you want. So far, I haven't come across any music that isn't there (barring Younha's newest Japanese album T.T edit: i checked. it's there now). Has the nice benefit of having lyrics (most of which are time synced too)

Only problem is that it's all in Chinese, although it's fairly straight forward and Google Chrome can do a fair amount of the translations.

You can download a client (it's in chinese), and it's pretty slick, pretty similar to spotify. If not, you can just use a web browser, and it should remember one playlist. There's ways to get your playlists to sync etc. but that requires you setting up an account, which I simply haven't been bothered to do yet.

Happy listening :D",18,49

236,2015-10-5,2015,10,5,1,3ngvvo,Went to BIGBANG's Made Tour Concert in LA,RamenRUs,1443977926,"I wanted to share my experiences at the BB concert I went to yesterday. Previously, I'd been going to KCON for 3 years straight. This is the first solo group concert I have ever gone to.

And it did not disappoint. The rumors are true. BB is fantastic live. Baby.

I sat in section 334, but the peripherals of the concert were good all around. Got great views of the concert.

There were 2 people who spoke mostly at the concert, which were Taeyang and Seungri. Of these two, Taeyang had the best English. It was really good. Seungri's English was very choppy. But he was there for more comedic effect and to make fun of. Seungri made a joke about how west coast was the best coast, and then he started talking about Notorious BIG -_- (for those who don't know, Notorious BIG is a New York rapper).

The BB Made trailer was used in between the songs for cut scenes, and it was much more extended. The trailer already confused me in the first place, but now I was even more confused. What I got from it was that BB stole a load of money after they were chased down by a group of girls, and after they took it they used it to have a party. At this party, there were a bunch of females. They end up getting too drunk, that they start having hallucinations and dreams that guilt tripped them into stealing the money. But then they wake up, and they don't care anymore. This is probably wrong HEHE.

They played MADE, Alive, popular pre-2011 old hits, and each member and subunit performed at least 1 song together. There were some songs left out that I wished they played. They did not play ""Lies"", "" Wedding Dress"", ""Gara Gara Go"", or "" Baby Goodnight"". That's OK though, cause they played other great songs!

In terms of set list, Bang Bang Bang was the first song, mixing it up between Made and Alive songs. Then somewhere in the middle, everyone had their solos. Finally, they ended with more Made songs. Their final song, appropriately, was Fantastic Baby. Everyone went ridiculous when Fantastic Baby came on.

BB performed like it was their last time. If that was the last kpop concert I would ever see in my life, I would be incredibly happy and satisfied. They brought it. Fantastic lighting. Singing and rapping was on point. They talked to the audience and made us feel loved. I am tearing up as I write this, because I don't want them to break up and go to the army!! They proved why they are my favorite group of all time.

Also, GD is my favorite member, but after this concert, I've completely converted to Taeyang and Daesung fan girls. Taeyang and Daesung are 2 of the best performers I have ever seen live. They went out there with heart. All the BB members were amazing, but Taeyang and Daesung were just on another level. 

I am welcome to answer any questions for people curious about the concert, not just about BB but the venue. Also, I would love to hear more Staples Center experiences as well as Mandalay Bay. Rock on, everyone!",142,114

245,2015-10-5,2015,10,5,7,3ni83s,For anyone interested in how Jonghyun's solo concert series is going,ladauphine,1443999186,"Hey guys. I figured I'd post a small fanaccount for people who are interested in how Jonghyun's Agit solo concert is going. I'm not particularly good at fanaccounting so bear with me please.

So far Jonghyun has had four of his eleven concerts. And every single night is quite different from the last. I have had friends in all but the first one and I was at last nights so I've heard all about the differences in each night. 

So basic breakdown is that he starts each night off with Deja Boo and then Hallelujah, alternately destroying you with cute then insane sexiness. These are the only two dances he really does the whole concert so he really gives them his all... and let me tell you that seeing Jonghyun's ""all"" for Hallelujah is likely to make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. I think I took maybe 10 breaths the entire song. 

After that he starts talking. And if you know anything about Jonghyun, he is a chatty little person. Like damn. And because the venue is so small (750 people max in a pretty small theater), he does A LOT of chatting with the crowd. Previous nights he spent time talking with a fan about Game of Thrones and he was scolding her for being too young to watch the show. He asked how old she was and what season she was on, when she said she was 19 on Season 5 he like held his forehead and was like ""too young, wait till you're twenty!"". He also does greetings in English, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai. There were only probably 10-15 English speakers so he tried to wave at us all individually scattered around the theater while saying ""Hello. I am a boy you are a girl"" (he knows that phrase kills English speaking Shawols). 

Last night as he was about to sing Juliette the staff had some technical difficulties so to entertain us he took song requests. One was originally a Japanese song I think, I don't know the name. The second one was Mono-Drama. I feel really privileged to have seen that, as he has NEVER performed it live and probably never will as it makes him too emotional and it is my favorite of his solo songs. He only did a little part of it and it was wonderful.

After Juliette he went off the stage and his backup dancers from Deja Boo and Hallelujah came out and did a really neat dance with the sofa and chairs that were now on the stage. Eventually the guys left... and the girls stayed. And thats when I knew I was in trouble.

Jonghyun came out, sat down in this billowy v neck sexy as fuck shirt, and did Playboy. The lights slowly undimmed on him to the ""heyy playboyyy"" and I was dead. He owned that song. It was extremely distressing. That one part that DO does in the EXO version where he kinda raps... yeah. That was always my favorite part and I always tried to imagine Jonghyun doing it. It is so much better than I could have imagined.

After that he did Lim Kim's No More and Son Dambi's Red Candle. Both were fucking gorgeous. He may have written and produced them for other people, but god knows he took them back and made them his own this past weekend.

After that, he reveals the guest. Every single show he has a different guest. Someone he has worked with musically or has influenced him. First night he had Taemin, second show (a 4 pm show on Saturday) was Jung In (she did a popular song with Leessang, and was on WGM, thats all I know about her), third show was a lyricist he has worked with and really respects, and last night was Nine. 

Nine was actually the best guest since Taemin, since Shawols are so familiar with her. Shes a weekly guest on Jonghyun's Blue Night and most of the really moving quotes that has come out of that show have come from nights when Nine has guested. They tend to talk about gender and other really interesting topics. 

She was great. She teased him a lot, kept accidentally calling him JJongDi and had to correct herself, and was super cute when all the fans were waving lightsticks at her. She performed two songs, I have no clue what but they were really pleasant. 

One extra special thing about the guest is that they get to request two songs. So it is different every night. Nine requested ""Nothing Better"" which was really lovely, he hasn't sang that since he was a wee little idol. The other song was devastating. She requested Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. He was really concerned, saying that there were too many foreign Shawols in the crowd and we'd make fun of his English. We all shouted NO NO. And he did it. And he dominated that song. Like, sure, he didn't get all the words right, and some things got all smushed together. But given that it was an on the spot thing, he did extremely well. He danced a bit and sang it with so much feeling. It was fucking awesome. I was GLEEFUL. Then he sat down next to Nine and hung his head all embarrassed and cute. 

After this was the first VCR. The VCR's are absolutely murderous. It starts with him laying shirtless in bed and just being tousled and sleepy and cute and then him getting ready to go to work. He made shaving cream mustaches and shampoo mohawks. Roo made a few appearances too. It was too too too cute.

After that he did a lot of songs like U&amp;I and Gloomy Clock (which he loves to have Shawols sing a long with). He did another talk where he asked if there were fanboys in the room (he is always looking for fanboys) and then asked if anyone had recently went through a breakup and talked to two girls about their breakups.

Then he asked everyone to turn their lightsticks off (there was one foreign fan who didn't and he asked her very sweetly in English). He did ""I'm Sorry"" first and by the end of the song he was totally choked up, crying while singing,and all the Shawols were crying with him. He ran off the stage for a minute to compose himself while the ""End of the Day"" VCR played. I honestly barely cried during the song, but then sobbed really hard during the VCR. The whole theater was a mess. 

Then he came out, still a bit weepy, and did ""End of the Day"" and it was beautiful as expected. Then, what I had been waiting for happened. He did Skeleton Flower.

A very light fabric came down from the ceiling over the stage. You could still see him but he was kind of misty looking and they projected these beautiful images on the fabric, lots of swirls and eventually a skeleton flower and it showed it being rained on and turning transparent as he was hitting the climax of the song. You know how he does the whole song mostly in falsetto (? my musical terminology is weak, forgive me), well he pulled that last chorus down into his normal powerful voice and it was absolutely killer to listen to. Stunningly gorgeous. I was also crying like a baby throughout this, I'm a Blinger, it's not unexpected.

He had another VCR showing him getting home from work and playing with Roo and watching SHINee performance videos with a really dopey grin on his face. 

Then he did ""Fine"" and made the room really really warm again with that song, hoo baby. Then he did Crazy. Now I went through BASE promotions, so I've seen Crazy A LOT. But this was easily the best Crazy performance I've ever seen. The live band made it so much better and he was so into it and he did Iron's rap and just let the Shawols take over the fanchanted parts entirely. It was the most energetic Crazy performance I've ever seen.

Then he left... we called for an encore and chanted his name. Finally he came back... and that asshole did Fortune Cookie. I was in denial for the first 30 seconds of the song. And he was so damn smug about it, picking a different girl in the audience to coo ""show me baby"" at each time. 

After that he read the fan event sign, picking a girl to hold it up closely for him to see by saying ""show me baby"" again. It was essentially ""we will be here waiting for you"". He started chiding us, saying that we are in this together. That we don't need to wait we are all together now, and have been since last May and that ot5 SHINee will be back not too long from now and that we were being silly. It was really sweet and touching the way he said it.

Finally we reached the last song. He did Beautiful Tonight. But because he is Kim Jonghyun and is a little hipster weirdo he couldn't just leave it at that. 

One of the official merch items was a kazoo. A freaking kazoo. The previous nights they had sold out of them, but they had restocked so most people had a kazoo Sunday night. And he had us play the kazoo with him. I played a kazoo with Jonghyun. He taught us the parts he wanted us to play and then he started the song. Just imagine Jonghyun singing that lovely song while a whole theater of girls are playing the ""Oooohh beautiful tonight. Oh say Oh say Oh say Oh say"" parts on fucking kazoos. Then he busted out his own kazoo and started playing. I had no idea that a kazoo was anything more than a noise maker, but listening to him play it was incredible. Like jaw dropping at how good it sounded. A KAZOO!! Then he had us put those away and assigned half the theater the ""Oh beautiful tonight"" part and the other half all of the ""oh say"" parts. And did a little orchestra with it. He seemed really pleased at how well we did. 

Then it was over. 

Addendums: in Korean, the kazoo is called a ""Kajoo"" and it is printed like that on the box... I have a Jonghyun Kajoo. And SM severely underordered like EVERYTHING. Especially Jonghyun's book. He asked us if we'd read it yet and everyone said no and he was all sad until he heard us shouting that no one had it yet cause it was all sold out. Also they sold out of lightsticks, which is really just shameful. SM has always been good about overordering lightsticks if nothing else.

tl;dr: The concert is better than I possibly thought it could be. Also I said small fanaccount... I clearly lied. ",32,144

Sorry to let you know, but every single server instance I've had that has been running the bot has been blacklisted by Koreaboo.com. I have tried changing my user agent, I've spun up 3 separate servers to try to get around the ban, but I haven't been able to consistently get and stay around it. 

So, unfortunately, /u/koreaboobot is dead. I can't keep spinning up new servers since it's running off my personal website, and I don't really know any other way to keep the bot running since I don't really know how Koreaboo is finding out the IP of the server that is running the bot. I just know that it's much easier for them to block me than for me to keep circumventing the block.  

It's been fun! If anyone needs any other bots in the future please let me know! This is a fantastic sub and it deserves nothing but the best! :)

&gt; There is always talk of popular idols having been under other agencies or even certain agencies having rejected them during auditions. 

&gt; In a recent discussion on online community board Instiz, a netizen published a thread titled An unfortunate entertainment company, listing several well-known idols such as G.NA, Wonder Girls Yubin, After Schools Uee, SECRETs Hyosung, SPICAs Jiwon, IU, Juniel, AOAs Choa, and 4MINUTEs Gayoon.

&gt; So what do these idols have in common? Good Entertainment.

&gt; The netizen writes, Good Entertainment They had a good eye. 

&gt; [Image](http://cdn.koreaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/99607e09cd4ff1371e9bda1ab3a82824.jpg)

&gt; Good Entertainment is an agency that was established in 2003 before closing down in 2009 due to their difficult financial situation. They are known for having Shinhwa and idol group Battle (disbanded) under their care for an amount of time.

&gt; The Wikipedia screenshot provided by the netizen also lists Sunmin, Eddy, Lyn, Lee Yerin, Lee Chang Myung, Lee Byung Jin, and Jung Jae Hwan.



&gt; Additionally, Good Entertainment is known for having almost debuted the girl group known as Five Girls which consisted of After Schools Uee, G.NA, Wonder Girls Yubin, SECRETs Hyosung, and SPICAs Jiwon. Other notable trainees include AOAs Choa, Juniel, IU, 4MINUTEs Gayoon, and U-KISSs Soohyun.

&gt; NETIZEN REACTIONS

To listen you would go through the University's radio station (urfonline.com) and you can listen from anywhere in the world.

Our second help would be for the social media side. We've just opened a twitter (@SussexKpopSoc) and a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Ktunesonurf) and would like help to improve these places with any collages or whatever you think of!

Thank you for reading and we'll be around for the next few hours including during the show to get any help from you guys and girls!

TL;DR UoS Kpop Society would like your help with getting our radio out there and improving ourselves with the overall production.

Edit: ~~Website seems down getting that sorted~~

Edit 2: Website is fine but cannot hyperlink via reddit. You'd have to physically type it in yourselves.

Edit 3: We are live!!! urfonline.com 

Edit 4: Thank you for tuning in and listening to us! We'll be on same time next week and link to our Facebook is above plus our Twitter handle! Thank you again for listening and helping out.",20,9

I have been to several different types of auditions such as American Idol and the X factor and the experience I had here was no different. The only difference was the volume of people. this audition was much smaller. also the people holding the auditions didn't seem to care. I couldn't tell if it was because they weren't actual employees of the company or if it was because they were bored. (i'll touch on this later on)
Anyways, I noticed that on the site, they suggested people come by their number but I just went at a time which was convenient for me so i guess it didn't really matter too much. Anyways I guess Ill talk about my experience and my opinions. 
First I got there and there was hardly anyone there. I noticed there were some people outside the building area who had auditioned already and were leaving. The audition was held in this room of a build corporate type building. It was the studio for a show I think. anyways we get there and they have you sign in or fill out applications. Once you hand in your application they give you a number and tell you to sit in the waiting area. There were several people who were staff and wore stickers that said staff. Then there were some older people who kept walking in and out. I wasn't sure who they were but there was an older man who i think might have been an employee of JYP or something but didn't end up judging us. When i got there they said they were waiting for the judges to come back from lunch since i got there around lunch time. But there were two young ladies who were walking around snapping pictures and they ended up being the ones who were in charge of holding the auditions. I don't know if they were just interns, employees, or just place holders while the judges returned. Im not sure. I know sometimes in american idol auditions to get through people faster, they just have a random employed staff member hold the spot and conduct auditions while real judges take breaks. This is to give the judges a break but also cut the volume of people faster since they just call you in and then have you leave without giving any results.
In the waiting room it was pretty diverse. I could tell some were just fans of kpop which in a way bothered me. I feel like they weren't serious about this opportunity and only saw it as a way to be close to their idols. anyways, when they were ready, they called us up in groups and then explained to us the proceedure, stand on the line, sing/ dance when ready, have music ready etc. We walk in and theres a big camera facing people as they wait as well as the table for the judge (the two girls who were snapping pictures which ended up being posted to JYP's social media, which is what gave me the impression they were interns). they have you stand on a line and audition 5 at a time. They have you start once the person before you finishes. many people sang in korean who i could tell didn't speak korean and simply memorized the sounds while some actually knew korean and sung in korean, and then some danced. Some danced their own choreo (which was cool to see) while others danced the choreo of a group. after the process is over they just usher you out and let the next group in. 

What i thought of the auditions
It was nerve racking, in other audition experiences, you find out on the spot if you got through to the next round or not, i wasn't exactly sure how these auditions worked. Also because the judges don't say or communicate much gave me a feeling of uncertainty. 
Group auditions made it more nerve racking because it feels like more pressure.
didn't know if judges who judged our group were the real judges which bothered me (the judges who were in charge of our audition group were the ones outside in the waiting area who were snapping pictures and posting it to social media)  
auditioners seemed more like kpop fans than aspiring artists. Though i could be wrong, but some of the people there just seemed to be there because they enjoyed certain groups or artists. For example, they all freaked out when certain idols came up on the tv while they were playing their mv or concerts. 

Tips:
practice, try practicing in front of family and friends or in public. to get rid of nerves. 
be genuine, i cant emphasize enough how much it bothered me that there were these people who were there mainly only because they were kpop fans. Hypothetically speaking its like they only wanted to try and get closer to their idols rather than be singers or artists. Sure you enjoy singing kpop songs, but do you even have a desire to be a musician?
Get there as soon as you can or when its convenient for you. from past auditions from x factor and american idol, I learned that the time they give you is only ""suggested"" meaning the sooner the better. They'll always have people waiting and if you get there earlier it wont hurt and it'll most likely save you time.

Nothing else really seems to interest me anymore. But soon as I see a new MV pop up on youtube i get this amazing feeling of joy. Its the only time i ever get stoked for anything. I know its kind of lame but i really hope im not the only one that feels this way. Somedays when i get home from a really stressful day at work ill just throw on Girls day(favorite group) videos to cheer me up and it always works. Its something small but great to me. Now i just need to make new friends into the same groups as me and ill be one happy camper

EDIT: Thank you all for being so kind. if you are going through anything close to the sort and ever need a friend. Well, im always here to talk",85,308

580,2015-10-10,2015,10,10,7,3o5oym,INFINITE EFFECT in London is over - and this is my experience!,Nanoshiima,1444431406,"So INFINITE had their concert today in London, and I've been hyped all the way leading up to it, and my goodness - how worth the wait it was.  
  
Doors were to open at 7pm, concert to start at 8pm, I started queueing at around 3:30pm. Around 15mins later, whilst sat in the queue, I saw a glimpse of a wild Sungkyu disappearing into the stage door. I didn't honestly think it would get any better, until [this](https://instagram.com/p/8n1wo8s5fk/) happened. 4 INFINITE members straight by me, including my two biases Woohyun and Dongwoo. The whole line was in happy chaos. Then, about 15mins after the appearance of the 4 - Hoya was teasing the waiting crowd by poking his head out of the building window two floors up or waving at us. Bunch of teases.  
  
I got into the building at 19:30,  and as soon as I got to my section (block 2), I saw that there was a huge screen, and Delicious was playing. Various INFINITE MVs were played, and I believe at about 8:05pm, Destiny finished playing, the lights blacked out and Bad's MV started. The crowd were screaming, and after Bad finished - there was a pause and INFINITE appeared, their first song being BTD. Crowd goes wild.  
  
A combination of talks and cinematics were used in between a couple of songs at a time, and there was a translator there when it was needed. Dongwoo was speaking mainly in English to the crowd, and teasing us. The cinematics were effective - whenever a member had a shot long in length, the crowd screamed.  
  
INFINITE H performed two songs, INFINITE F I believe performed a longer version of My Girl ~~they may have also sung Heartbeat.~~ Sungkyu sung Kontrol (the crowd went wild), and Woohyun also had a solo. Hoya couldn't dance due to his injury, so the songs he was most active in was the two INFINITE H songs, and he did slight dancing movements in INFINITE's new songs.    
  
There was a live band performing, which added to the fun of it. Chills everywhere when INFINITE played Back near the end.
  
As a filler, Last Romeo's original MV was played, so INFINITE didn't actually sing live to it. I can't think exactly how many songs were played, but i'm estimating it to be in the 24 to 25 range. ~~they didn't sing their debut song like I think they did at earlier INFINITE EFFECTS :c~~ When the last song was played, there was a massive confetti shower and fans shedding tears. Perfect song to end it on.  
  
Concert ended about 22:30, happy fans, happy INFINITE. Dongwoo made a joke in one of the talks (spoken in English) that the schedule made his feet hurt, -cue sympathetic awwws from the fans, in which he protested the sympathy, but INFINITE looked more than happy.  
  
So that's my experience of INFINITE EFFECT - gutted I can't go again. If anyone has any questions, leave them and i'll reply tomorrow (it's almost midnight here now) but my goodness, INFINITE absolutely kill it dancing and singing live.

It seems a lot of East Coasters went/are going to this show, so I figured it'd be nice to have a discussion and get all your thoughts on it. 





Here was the setlist:

* BangBangBang
* Tonight
* Stupid Liar 
* Haru Haru
* Loser
* Blue
* Bad Boy 
* If You
* Strong Baby
* Wings
* Doom Dada
* EyesNoseLips
* Zutter
* Good Boy
* Crooked
* Sober
* Bae Bae
* Fantastic Baby 
* We Like 2 Party (Encore)


Some of my personal observations:


* They've improved in English so much! Everyone laughed at Seungri's Engrish, Daesung/TOP were charismatic as fuck, and GD sounded accentless. 


* Super surprised at no Lies or Lets Not Fall In Love (the latter played during the credits). Stupid Liar was an interesting choice.  


* The live band was absolutely amazing. 



* IMO, Seungri/Daesung/TOP had much better solo stages than Taeyang/GD. More energy and more dynamic. 




* On that note, Daesung was the best. For the fewish lines he gets, he *kills* them, and Wings was the highlight of the show for me. 




* In between sets of 2 or 3 songs, they played parts of a longer full version of the MADE trailer. It was really cool. TOP is crazy. 



* CRAZY is so hot.

My biggest fan service during the show :D I also shook hands with Dongwoo and touched Sungjong &amp; L hands. L exchanged hand signs with me so much, my bias looks incredible in real life. 

Oh and I recorded the moment Hoya touched my hand on my 4k fancam of Pretty. https://youtu.be/OSGcGIZqBo8

Even though i got front row the queuing was chaos. Also when everyone got inside the venue all my friends left with bruises, and some even blacked out from getting chocked. Here's a quote from my friends Facebook status, she was in **row 7** 

&gt; Infinite came on stage thats when shit went ham!!
&gt; THE PUSHING WAS RIDICULOUS... when i say pushing you might think it's something normal but this was pushing on another level i literally found myself getting pushed back to front left to right.. we were about to fall on the floor so many times... i think i was the first one to start crying because i couldn't breathe i was literally choking coughing.. i was so helpless because there was no way out everyone was too busy worrying about pushing to the front.. thank god i had my friend with me that tried to keep people away from me but did it help? no!! i was screaming for help i wanted to get out as soon as possible because the pushing never stopped.. it wasn't something short it carried on for so long... people actually tried getting help by writing help on their LED app.. before i fucking blacked out i saw Hoya looking at me so scared bless him.. i didn't want my bias to notice me while choking to death :'(( when i finally screamed my way out i literally fell on the floor it was so bad i literally thought i was dying.. i can't believe i experienced this.. i would never imagined it happening to me.. 

PS. Sorry I'm a long time lurker of this subreddit so unsure how to post all of this, I'll be happy to edit/fix the formatting if you guys let me know :)",37,41

Mods please be kind. 

Okay, so I attended the Big Band Made Concert in Newark last night, and it was legitimately one of the best nights of my life; maybe the best. I feel so appreciative that I got to experience it. Now I know with what I'm about to say, some people who weren't able to make it may get upset. I get that, and I want you to know it isn't my intention. But instead of being happy and overjoyed at getting to see them live, I'm just sad. Like really, really upset. 

Where I live, nobody listens to Kpop, let alone know's who Big Bang is. I have no friends to talk to about it, even my family (besides my younger sis who at least appreciates GD and Vernon from Seventeen) thinks it's really weird.

Last night felt like something out of a dream. I was surrounded by thousands of people who not only understood my love for Big Bang, but actually loved them too! I met so many friendly people from all over the country, and it felt so amazing to see how not alone I was in this offbeat passion of mine.

Then, the concert itself was INCREDIBLE. All the members were on point, I was close enough to the stage that at certain points they were less than 15 feet away from me, and Taeyang literally stopped in his tracks, smiled at me, winked, and blew me a kiss. I could've died. I had so much fun, that night was everything I've been dreaming of for YEARS.

But now, it's over. And for some reason, I feel overcome with sadness. I spent months looking forward to this, and then the day came, and it's done. I don't even know when, or if, they'll ever come back. After finally being surrounded with people who made me feel accepted and at home, it's back to my lonely reality. Don't get me wrong, my friends and family are great. I have a loving boyfriend who makes me super happy. But Kpop is without a doubt one of my greatest loves and passions in life. To not be able to truly share it with anyone who isn't behind a computer screen is, well, shitty.

So, obviously, I'm in need of some advice guys. Please make me feel better, I hate being sad :(

Edit: Thanks for all the help guy's I love you all. I just posted this on the subreddit, but here's a direct link to Daesung's sexy dance at the concert yesterday. Think of it as a giant thankyou from me to you! :D

Hi, my name is Juliette, I'm a college student in a scriptwriting class in which we are currently writing documentaries. I'm looking for fans that are willing to be interviewed about Kpop and it's fandom within this week, so I could really use the help of this subreddit. I need one or two people from San Diego but I would appreciate a Skype interview from anyone on any continent. 

Some other things:

* interviewees should probably be 15+
* looking for more-than-casual fans
* if you don't like being on camera, don't worry because I only need to record the audio to write the script

~~If you're willing to help, please message me asap and also thanks haha. If you have any questions that would help you make up your mind or just any questions in general, feel free to comment and I will answer as soon as I get home. I will also probably be editing this later, seeing as I am on my phone now.~~


Edit 2: Thank you all for your offers. I'm not taking any more since I have so many right now. It's wonderful and overwhelming at the same time. :') haha So unless you have a REALLY unique perspective or story that you think MUST be put into my script, I can't take you. :(   Thanks again! And boy, do I hope this turns out well!",37,26

888,2015-10-15,2015,10,15,23,3ov1th,[Discussion] Top 5 Singles of 2015?,djswims,1444920133,"Considering 2015 has been one of the best years in K-Pop full of great releases, I'd love to know what you guys are thinking deserves the top ranking positions of this year. Personally, my top 5 would be:

1.) [Red Velvet - Ice Cream Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls)

2.) [Stellar - Vibrato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmTdFpIDX8)

3.) [Oh My Girl - Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk)

4.) [SEVENTEEN - Adore U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rUFQJrCT7M)

5.) [Red Velvet - Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0)

Obviously I'm biased in these picks, but that's inevitable for everyone. I based mine off of song quality with an influence on video and era, but heavily based on the song pick itself. But I'd love to hear your top 5 based on any attribute; top 5 videos, top 5 songs, or top 5 eras.

So, what do you guys think were the best 5 singles released this year?",34,4

Where's everyone sitting? Who's there now? Did anyone see GD at the MCA? Or Seungri/GDTOP out at Marquee last night? Where's the BB x Koala pics at?? 

I wonder if they'll keep the same set list! 

Edit: will do a giant edit of this when I'm home!

Concert started just before 8:30 and everybody was already losing their shit when their MV's from the MADE series were playing and ended around 10:30.


Set list!

Here was the setlist: 

* Bang Bang Bang
* Tonight
* Stupid Liar 
* Haru Haru
* Loser
* Blue
* Bad Boy 
* If You
* Strong Baby (THIS WENT OFFFFFFFFFF)
* Wings
* Doom Dada
* Eyes Nose Lips
* Zutter
* Good Boy
* Crooked
* Sober
* Bae Bae
* Fantastic Baby 
* We Like 2 Party (Encore)
* *Outro of* Bae Bae

*My (fangirl) account*


* The boys' English has improved so much! I was really surprised, the only Korean spoken was by TOP which I assume was a speech thanking the fans.

* I think they *really* like Australia, like *really*. 

* Seungri is gonna tell his mother, his father and his cousins about how great the crowd was tonight (lol) and he said ""i don't give a shit"", kid needs a filter hahaha

* Also, Seungri can guarantee that Daesung did not have plastic surgery on his BIG eyes after a suspenseful reveal of Daesung's eyes.

* Also, also Daeri is real. 

* The solo stages were sooooooooo good. Although I'm not the biggest fan of Strong Baby, it went off. It really reminded me how great of a performer Seungri is and the graphics behind them were cool. Wings was great too, YEAHHHHHH~~~~~. 

* TOP is so handsome IRL.

* Seungri IS BLOND AGAIN AND BASICALLY KILLED ME WITH HIS BLACK SHIRT AND CAP.

1146,2015-10-20,2015,10,20,15,3pgjrw,Attended SM's weekly LA audition,kpopbust,1445321928,"This is a continuation of my Audition experiences. I recently auditioned for JYP during their global audition which lead me to discover more options and more outlets to audition. So I found SM's weekly LA auditions. I attended on Saturday. The experience was very different. First the volume was significantly less. Maybe less than 10 in total I came across while I was there. The room was in an office (reminded me of like a doctors office or something) You find the room which was room 300 and you enter and its really clean looking. All white and has SM on this desk and two girls sitting there who asked if I was here for the audition which I replied with a yes. They handed me audition forms and told me to wait. Anyways, when they called me up, I entered a room with two judges, one who just sat there and another who explained the entire process and guided me step by step. A lot of it was formality kind of things. The explained certain things regarding the language that even though you didn't speak korean it was ok since it was a audition in the US. They tell you stand on the blue tape and then to introduce yourself to the camera with your name, age, school/ occupation, and number on your sticker. Then they ask you to sing or whatever you came to audition for. I did fairly well during the singing part in my personal evaluation and opinion. I was able to hit every note and didn't feel nervous. The only funny thing was that because it was a pretty hot day, they had AC on and said you may need to sing louder if the AC comes on so its clearer when they're recording. Luckily that didn't happen. While I was singing, I noticed the two judges writing to each other on a post it, not sure what that was about but they seemed to be smiling. Anyways, when I finished they moved on to a rhythm test. They explained that you can clap along to the beat or free style. But she said the frame of the camera wasn't too wide so if you free style you didn't have much room. I didn't know how wide the frame was so I just chose to bop/ snap/ clap to the beat. It was a little embarrassing. Not sure if this effected my chances or not by not dancing. But after that portion they stopped me. They asked me if i spoke any other languages and asked me to introduce myself in the languages. I was kind of nervous to do this I introduced myself in Cantonese and Mandarin and Im usually pretty good but i was nervous about it so I kind of stuttered a little. Anyways, at the end the explained how they would need to send everything to korea, and if you don't hear back that you can simply audition again. As I exited the room, I was closing the door behind be and noticed the judge turned to the other judge as if to ask ""So what did you think"" kind of, I was tempted to stay and spy but I didn't want to be caught so i just left. haha. But I wish the other companies had weekly auditions as well. 
*EDIT: For anyone else with audition experience in the weekly auditions whether it be in LA or other places, I read on other forums they've asked people to sing more than one song. If your experience was different than mine, I'd be glad to hear your experience as well!*",31,54

1263,2015-10-22,2015,10,22,9,3ppe1a,Carly Rae Jepsen's track about masturbation might possibly appear on the new f(x) album,ruedolf,1445472078,"This is **PURELY SPECULATION** so take it with a grain of salt! A user on ATRL mentioned it and there's some evidence to back these claims.

Carly Rae Jepsen penned over 250 songs for her critically-accllaimed third studio album *EMOTION* (which is pop perfection, if you haven't heard it already) and [in an interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_written_by_Bonnie_McKee) with the New York radio show *Zach Sang and the Gang* back in August, she revealed that one of the tracks that didn't make it onto the album was written with Bonnie McKee (""Teenage Dream"", ""Hold it Against Me"") about a private activity that rhymes with ""**contemplation**"".

**EDIT**: It's registered with the ASCAP here: (http://i.imgur.com/m4A9LGy.png)

&gt; ""Thank you! I couldn't say it myself. Anyways, about five minutes into it I was like, 'You know this isn't making my album right?' and we were like, 'Well whatever, let's just go with it.' And it was so fun to just let yourself ... Because I write for the joy of it and you've gotta let yourself go everywhere.""

She also stated that the song was picked up by an act in China. 
&gt; ""We were kind of laughing a little bit later on because it got picked up actually. **There's a group in China that wants to make it their next single**, and we were like, 'Alright! I wonder if they know what it means?'""

Fast forward to this October, [in an interview with Much News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nY4_Cco67qY) last week, she revealed the song's title to be ""**When I'm Alone**"". 

&gt; ""And we're laughing 'cause it did get picked up and we're kind of stoked to see it kind of take on new form with, probably, a more type of a *sex kitten* who can pull it off.""

How does this connect to f(x)? Their track list for *4 WALLS* was [unveiled](https://twitter.com/fsoojng/status/656807592056885250) at the exhibition today.

&gt; 4 WALLS

&gt; GLITTER

&gt; DEJA VU

&gt; X

&gt; RUDE LOVE

&gt; DIAMOND

&gt; TRAVELER

&gt; PAPI

&gt; CASH ME OUT

&gt; ***WHEN I'M ALONE***

And yes, China and Korea are not the same (also don't forget that Vicki is Chinese!) but songs are shopped around all the time, and it's possible that she mixed it up or was misinformed.

Of course this could all end up being a mere coincidence. Even then, would you be here for a sensual f(x) song about the [Touch of (their) Hand(s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM3pnBRvG1M)?",66,142

Which is awesome to see! I grew up going to all different types of shows from metal to hip hop. And at 90 percent of shows i always see fights, or people with such negative energy that it ruins the whole vibe. I feel like if i went to a huge kpop concert that i could go up, talk to anyone and theyd be interested in being my friend, I absolutely love it. I dont know why everyones so nice and respectful. Maybe its the vibe kpop gives, maybe its because finding people into kpop is harder than finding someone into Country or some other mainstream genre. Whatever the reason, other music scenes need to take notes. Because this is how music should bring people together. Thank you all for being a part of this awesome music scene.

(Blocked in the US, I don't know if any other countries are effected, it seems Canada is fine).

&amp;nbsp;

**So far these the ones that are blocked:**

**update:** [Woolim Entertaiment](https://www.youtube.com/user/woolliment) (Infinite, Lovelyz) **Most videos are back online but not all** It's weird. (ie: Sung Kyu's   works but not Kontrol).


[J.tune camp](https://www.youtube.com/user/jtunecamp) (MBLAQ, Madtown)


**update:** [Brave Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/user/bravefamily) (Brave brothers.) **Some videos available**


[ JAPAN OFFICIAL](https://www.youtube.com/user/BTSjapanofficial) (BTS Japanese videos)


[2PM Japan Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/2pmSMEJ)


[SSEnt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_iY7cpvHDOb25ZaXQR63w) (The Legend, though still available on LOEN channel)

&amp;nbsp;

Videos from these companies that are on distribution channels still work fine (like on 1thek).

&amp;nbsp;

**The ones I've checked that are fine are:** SM, YG, JYP, Cube, NHMedia, Pledis, FNC, HappyFace, Jellyfish. DSP Media, C-JeS Ent. and TS Entertainment


**User jjabeum did a lot of digging to compile a long list of ones that are still up vs a few more that are also down (that are not included here)**

1436,2015-10-25,2015,10,25,4,3q2ckf,"In history of Kpop, which Kpop idol groups are in the discussion for GOAT?",hk0125,1445715083,"So far I have three groups that I think would be in the discussion for GOAT.

H.O.T

G.O.D

Big Bang

H.O.T is the first major Kpop idol group to exist. They are the very first generation idol. They set the trend for other idol groups to come. Having a group consisting of five or more members were not very common back then and H.O.T was the first group to really set that trend. They also pave the way with their fashion styles, pretty boy faces, cute and sharp dance choreography, catchy tunes, and etc. A lot of groups followed their suit even today. I think their songs are good but not amazing. They have really good title songs but rest of their songs in the albums were hit or miss. Still they are the first ones to do it and popularize it. 

G.O.D seems really underrated especially to international fans. They are not really talked about much and always have been lost in the shuffle when talking about first generation idols. I think out of all idol groups, they have the most impressive discography. Seriously their songs are amazing to listen to, even today. They were different from the typical idol boy-bands because they weren't reliant on pretty boy looks and style but rather focused on their music. They didn't have this mysterious and hidden image/vibe that H.O.T had but rather more of a friendly next door neighbor vibe. These members when they first started out weren't young either. One of the member was 30 years old! They had their own unique voice and their music was totally different from what was typical of kpop groups those days and even today. There is a reason why they were the first artist ever to win Daesang in 3 Major broadcasting network (SBS, MBC, KBS) and they did it TWICE in a row back to back (with the songs Lie and Road). They broke the Guinness record for total album sold with their third album. They were also the first idol group to have their own reality show which maintained high ratings week in and week out (even forced the almighty Gag-Concert to readjust to different time slot). However their downfall was as quick as how they rose to fame. While I think they had the best prime, their longevity just didn't last long for a group that had so many fans.

Last but not least, Big Bang. I also consider Big Bang a very unique group who had their own sound and was very different from the generic kpop. I think they were the first idol group to put heavy emphasis on the rap instead of the vocals. They had their own style not just with music but appearance and swagger. And one of the biggest strength that this group has is the individuality. All five members have their own unique parts. They each have strong individuality where they can go solo and still achieve fame. Each of them are very talented and different from each other but mesh well in one track. They also have great longevity and it doesn't look like they are stopping anytime soon. They produce hit songs on every album and all of their songs on their album are a must-listen. If I were to pick one person from an idol group that made the biggest impact on kpop, it would have to be G Dragon. Not just as a rapper/singer but as an artist and a producer. He is literally a genius. YG would not have been this successful without G Dragon. The book hasn't closed for this group yet but it's hard not to rank them in the top 3 of all time. 

Honorable Mention: Shinhwa, DBSK, SNSD, FinkL, etc

1447,2015-10-25,2015,10,25,14,3q4cjx,Weird numbering of Hello Venus releases,klopfzeichen,1445751491,"I recently noticed that Hello Venus releases have kind of a weird enumeration system. Here is their discography:

Mini albums

1.Venus - 1st mini album  
2.What are you doing today? - 2nd mini album  
3.Would you stay for tea? - 3rd mini album  
4.Sticky Sticky - 4th single  
5.I'm ill - 5th mini album  

Singles

1.Venus  
2.What are you doing today?  
3.Would you stay for tea?  
4.Sticky Sticky  
5.Wiggle wiggle - 5th digital single  
6.I'm ill  

The thing is they named Sticky Sticky the 4th single but they count it as the 4th mini album aswell so I'm ill ends up being the 5th mini album. And they count all their mini albums as singles also so Wiggle Wiggle ends up being the 5th single. So in my opinion the whole thing is kind of messy with the disparate naming and all. Are there other idol groups with similar problems?",11,3

For instance, Day6 INTL had their youtube channel taken down recently (https://twitter.com/DAY6intl/status/658652539890630656). And it's a pity that all those subs are now gone. 

Well, here's a solution. Softsubs over the official videos where you can still track number of views, and our platform does exactly that (www.yasub.com). Now this might come as shameless self-promotion, but I genuinely believe that this helps the cause of spreading fandom and supporting the original video owners. Whether its an EXO interview, Big Bang Music Video, the site makes it very easy for anyone to add subtitles and even let the original owners add them back to youtube if they want to. 

Please check it out, leave some feedback, or help spread the word about it!

1659,2015-10-28,2015,10,28,12,3qikrw,Which kpop groups could have potential in the American market? Why have some groups struggled with English releases?,ksantry918,1446003797,"I'm an American and obviously there are a good amount of kpop fans in America, but my question is mostly referring to breaking out into the mainstream music scene (like Top 40 radio). To my knowledge, the only idol to do that was PSY, but even him I haven't heard from in a while. Most of his fame surrounded the popularity of his music video/dance.

I know a few kpop groups have had English releases. I can specifically remember The Wonder Girls attempting to make it in America back in like 2009, but it never really panned out. From an American perspective, while ""Nobody"" was an extremely catchy song, I never really expected it to do too well over here. I just didn't see it as a song that would do well on the radio here. Also, they really targeted the tween market with their Nickelodeon movie and a Jonas Brothers tour. The Jonas Brothers struggled enough trying to get on the radio because of their tween image...and Akon was a long forgotten celebrity by the time they worked with him.

I know making it in the US is extremely difficult to do, but this is all hypothetical. I'm just curious to hear other's input. I really wish kpop was more mainstream over here!

Personally, I think f(x) would be one of the groups that could have potential to make it if they tried. They have two fluent English speakers, they only have four members (boy/girl bands with over 5 members generally don't happen here), they're all attractive, and their music is a little different from most in kpop. I remember the first time I listened to the Red Light album, all I could think was how well some of those songs could do in America if they were in English. I thought the same with their new album with all of the EDM influence. 

Anyway, just a random thought for the day. What do you all think?

Majority of the time though we were chatting and singing some songs (not loudy or annoying anyone, just in our group). 

A few times some Korean people starting making fun of us in Korean and English (our other friend translated). At one point during the concert a girl and her friends said ""this is the worst Kpop karaoke we've ever heard"". That wasn't directed at us but the whole group of people standing and singing. Another time some other people said "" they aren't even Korean, why are they here"". 

Ruined part of the concert for me. I'd imagine people would embrace people of other cultures liking some part of your own, instead it seemed that most of the Koreans (not all though) weren't too pleased with non-Koreans being there and singing the songs.",109,60

1765,2015-10-30,2015,10,30,1,3qq097,Ever been encouraged by someone who speaks Korean for liking or singing Kpop?,Hitokiri2,1446136439,"As many of us might know there's been a thread where people are talking about being insulted for...

1. Either liking Kpop
2. Either liking something about the Korean culture or media
3. Or either speaking in the Korean language (whether fluent or not)

In my experience I've been there and know that some Koreans do find it funny, insulting, or embarrassing that a foreigner might do something like this. To them its weird and they might not know how to act so they quickly do something so that foreigner would quit it (unless that foreigner just blows their doors off).  I feel that even though these experience are few and far in between it can leave a very bitter taste in the mouth of the foreigner. Then again....this can be said of anywhere. 

As I said, I experienced some negativity but most of the time it turned out to be a positive. Many of my Koreans friends have encouraged me to learn their language and customs and I have also encouraged them to learn mine as well. 

One my first stories of a Korean encouraging me was when I was in college and I belonged to an anime/Asian drama club. I was away from home and I just wanted to meet friends who had the same interest plus there was a girl there who I liked who later became my GF. One day six mainland Korean students came in and joined us. The loved mangas and were also looking for friends outside their usual Korean crowd and wanted to learn English quicker. 

One day I was reading something like Naruto or something (it was hot at the time) and one guy asked me if I liked that manga. After that we became quick friends. I was somewhat into Kpop but not really but it was through him I found what I missed. Through me he found out that American dramas were not that bad. We would go forth and back from each other's houses watching Korean and American TV shows. 

When my GF and I hooked up and he also hooked up with his GF (soon to be wife) and we became very good friends and stay friends today. Through them I met many other Korean friends and through us they met a bounty of other friends besides Koreans. 

So yes. There are crappy people out there but overall people are good. I would always suggest bringing a fluent speaking Korean with you if you ever visit a Korean town or the more traditional Korean parts of town such as some places in New York or Chicago. It makes thing simpler, less likely to get snapped at, and you'll get better prices overall - trust me. :P",25,17

It has to be purely informational and I can choose whatever three aspects of K-pop I want.

 Can anyone give me suggestions on what three topics are the most interesting in your opinion to talk about, and what are the best scholarly sources to use?
     I was thinking for the three topics, I would go into Psy and how that exposed a lot of people to K-pop, G-dragon being named the ""Michael Jackson of K-pop"", maybe how there is a lot of plastic surgery in the industry,and/or dissect the roles in groups, like why there are members who serve mainly as visuals, dancers, etc. 

Any advice at all is appreciated! Thanks for reading!

* Primary -  references a ton of other Primary songs on the album (I know Primary is not really kpop but bear with me) 

* Rainbow - ""To me"" Woori's rap mentions their past singles Gossip Girl, A and Mach

* EXID - ""Ah yeah"" has just a second of the hip dance from ""Up and down""
