10,2019-4-1,2019,4,1,9,b7uqnf,Who is your dream kpop girl group,Isdaman,1554077408,"Assuming you could pick any member of any group in their prime, who would you assemble in your girl group? These would be my picks. 
  
  
Main Vocal - Ailee - Hands down the best vocalist of Kpop.
   
Lead Vocal - Taeyeon, SNSD - Great vocalist, a top tier visual.  and her popularity speaks for itself.
  
Main Dancer - Momo, TWICE - This was a hard decision. I was deciding between Chung Ha and Seulgi, but eventually went with Momo because of her international influence. Arguably the most popular Japanese Kpop idol, a strong visual, and a top 10 dancer. 
  
Main Rapper - CL, 2ne1 - Top tier rapper and arguably the best idol known for her rapping. Incredibly famous, top tier stage presence, and a unique voice. 
  
Lead Rapper - Jennie, BlackPink - Great rapper, great visuals, top tier stage presence and star power. Great popularity. 
  
Face of the Group - IU - Not much to say here. She's IU. Who else would you rather have representing the group than one of the most notable figures in kpop
  
Visual - Yoona, SNSD - Hardest pick for me. After countless names I had it down to Jisoo, Suzy, and Yoona. Eventually went with Yoona as she is the textbook example of the Korean beauty standard. If I wanted to appeal to a more western audience I would have went with Suzy. 
  
Leader - Irene, RV - With a team of popular figures and lots of egos, a great leader is key. Irene leads seriously with no nonsense. She knows how to handle egos. Besides leading by force she leads as a kind mother. She is incredibly humble. And as a strong feminist she is also a strong female figure. Top tier visual, great dancer, Insanely popular. 
  
Variety - Hani, Exid - Hilarious and relatable. Variety queen

I've decided to **delay the next round** by a day so that any lack of voting doesn't influence which stars move to the next round. Sorry for the delay, the tournament will be right back on schedule tomorrow with the round of 16 beginning at 12:00 EST! Please discuss group B matchups and group A results here!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

I'd like to ask if i can achive some of their hairstyles with my thick and really straight european hair, i've heard that you need to have asian hair to do their hairstyles so that would be really unfortunate for me. So my question is can i achive some of the korean hairstyles with my europian hair or do i need to have asian hair in order to do their hairstyles?

Some other countries also legally require male and female conscription, like Norway and China, but it's weakly or not enforced at all. 

In SK, men have to serve for roughly two years. If this was extended to women, what could happen? Girl groups are already known to, on average, have shorter lifespans than boy groups. On one hand, being compelled to perform military service during the peak of their careers could ruin everything, on the other hand, girl groups typically don't last long enough for it to matter. For example, Girl's Day are effectively disbanded, but besides Sojin, the members are still well younger than 30. ",79,89

I had wanted something to have on nicely in the background without the hassle of earbuds, so I tried to figure out what variety was available to stream from Alexa.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I have found a limited variety of Kpop provided.  While, Alexa can play songs specifically from BTS discography, it is usually the same title tracks every time I activate the station.  Not to say I won't bop to ""Mic Drop Remix,"" ""DNA,"" or ""Blood Sweat &amp; Tears"" but, when they continuously come on time after time, I'm ready for something new.  Despite being able to give good answers when asked ""Who is BLACKPINK"" or ""Who is GOT7, except for Girls Generation and BTS, I have not had success in getting Alexa to play stations of songs from other artists.  For example, she does not play songs from other notable korean music influences like EXO, Twice, or Big Bang, to name a few.

&amp;#x200B;

Not having luck with, getting Alexa to play specific group songs, I was successful in getting her to play a generic Kpop station.  Surprisingly, along with the BTS title tracks, Momoland's 2018 hits ""Bboom Bboom"" and ""Baam""  were the only other songs played by other Korean artists in my half hour of listening.  I may have to listen to the Kpop station a few more times to find variety; however, I have become quickly disillusioned by it's options.  

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, this is a first world problem, but, I would like to know if others have had a similar experience.  If there are any suggestions for something I may be doing wrong or you have had a different experience, let me know!",5,8

My personal favorite (besides our r/kpops descent into meme madness ) April Fools Day prank is the tradition of fansites on twitter switching their profiles for a day in order to confuse their fandoms. A common practice is to post pictures of different idols (usually from a different group) for a day, but some fansites also change their profiles to reflect fandom inside jokes!

For example:

-  [ateez seonghwa fansites dedicating their profiles to httyds toothless and angry birds](https://twitter.com/seongwhoa/status/1112372366955474944?s=21) (because of the inside joke that seonghwa resembles both characters!)

-  [an ateez hongjoong fansite becoming a profile dedicated to minions](https://twitter.com/seongwhoa/status/1112377602193453057?s=21) (bc his nickname is korean big minion lol)

-  [monsta x kihyuns fansite posting pics of various hyuns](https://twitter.com/jaena_baby/status/1112395605584666625?s=21)

-  [a chuu (loona) fansite becoming a pikachu(u) fansite](https://twitter.com/choerrygo/status/1112375435281616897?s=21)

- [clc fansites changing their profile pics to items from the lyrics of no then doing a reply thread together](https://twitter.com/kkwonsshh/status/1112381491537805317?s=21) in the order of the lyrics

-  [an nct johnny fansite turning into a jason derulo fansite looool](https://twitter.com/seongwhoa/status/1112378927253737472?s=21)

-  [a day6 wonpil and a stray kids seungmin fansite trading biases for the day](https://twitter.com/staychrischan/status/1112404929673519105?s=21) (because of the inside joke that they look alike and bc seungmin js a huge day6/wonpil fan)

-  [an irene fansite becoming an iz*one sakura fansite](https://twitter.com/baefarm329/status/1112376175249129472?s=21) (sakura is famous for being an irene stan/reveluv)

Recently I was in a social situation and was asked to play kpop, there was kid (about 8) involved so I thought hed like Twice - TT because of the Halloween theme and the costumes, and of course, the choreography. I was surprised he wasnt a bit interested. So I showed him TXT - Crown and it really catched his eyes because of the special effects, even simple things like upside down scenarios. 

Kids are really smart though, I got really surprised when he asked me what were those pink things during a Signal stage performance, I thought he was talking about three different elements of the scenery before I realized he was was talking about the candy bongs the audience was holding. My grown up friends dont ask me about the light sticks, they dont notice them.

This goes for most Kpop MV's as well.... GIVE IT MORE THEN ONE LISTEN AND VIEW.

Watch it once, then again and maybe again. Listen for drops and cuts you didn't catch the first time. Try to appreciate vocals or moves you didn't when you first watched. 

After that, THEN form your opinion. Way too many people are in a hurry to instantly comment and give their views.

Shit I would say 90% of the videos and songs I like now, I did not like on the first listen. ",0,0

What draws me and keeps me into Kpop is the spectacle: the pageantry that's practically a self-contained world.

There are the music videos (of which there are sometimes multiple versions!), the ever-changing hair, makeup, and fashion, the elaborate ""concepts"", the comeback stages, the performances, live concerts, the constructed narratives of in-group dynamics, the endless variety shows, kdramas, movies, and more. It's beyond anything we have in the US (imo), and it's pure escape. It's so addictive. As long as the music doesn't actively suck, I'm pretty happy.

Actually, one group did use a live band and that was BTS. Their concerts are incredible and Im not even the biggest fan of BTS. I think the impressiveness of their concerts comes from the fact that their instrumentals are live. 

Does anyone know why more groups dont use live bands? SHINee is one of my ults and Id love to buy one of their concert DVDs but I dont think they use live bands (even though theyd sound amazing with one). Is it the expense of having to pay musicians to play at each event or are companies just too lazy to rearrange the song so a band could play along?",17,11

444,2019-4-2,2019,4,2,13,b8empe,This is the Golden Era of Kpop,NoLholding,1554180843,"I think we're currently in the golden era of kpop. This may get long so bare with me. This isn't necessarily about the music, but more about the business. I've been thinking for the last few years (around 2015 - now), that this is the best time to debut as a kpop artist. In the last few years especially, Korean culture in general has exploded. Of course Kpop and Kdrama have had their impact for a while now, but somethings feels different. We're at the point where pretty much any major Kpop release is guaranteed to hit the trending page on YouTube, something that just a few years back was unheard of.
 
I starting crafting this ""theory"" if you can call it that, when KARD debuted. They are a very interesting group to me. They were popular off the bat, and they basically built their fan base from majority non-Korean fans. Till this day I believe they are more successful internationally than domestically, and it doesn't even matter because of the way the digital world works now. YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Snap, etc. did their job. Even something ""niche"" like kpop pushes through international boundaries MUCH easier than at any other point in history due to how connected the world has become. 

Another flash point in this theory timeline is when Momoland, and also just a few days ago, ATEEZ appeared on the Fine Brother Reaction channel. One of the biggest and most influential YouTube channels on the planet, and those videos both did big numbers. More importantly, it felt organic and not forced. Reading the comments you can see the genuine reach the fan base has, not just a bunch of ""who are these people"" comments. It's especially noteworthy since ATEEZ doesn't come from a crazy big company either, and they only debuted 8 MONTHS AGO. 8 months from debut to being featured on one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world. 

Not to mention the general increase in crossover as well. Just recently we had a Jason Derulo, 1MILLION and Lay collab. Steve Aoki and Monsta X collab. Pharrell in Seoul chilling with Bobby, Jay Park, Black Pink and many more. And these were just off the top of my head. And I don't even need to mention BTS's crossover, that's a whole chapter in Kpop history by itself. And the part I can't stress enough is that this all feels organic, and not just simply ""riding the popular wave for clout"". There's nothing wrong with wanting to be part of something trendy, but you can feel that all these people have a genuine mutual respect for each other as global performers and artists.

Also huge amounts of money are being invested  into the industry as a result. Some of these rookie debut songs and videos have really good quality, even from companies I've never heard of before. But with more money can come more bad management and mistreatment. That will unfortunately be present in every industry anywhere in the world, but at least it's becoming easier to shed a light on the shady stuff now because of social media's presence. Still, tons of groups debut and fly under the radar, but now with the rapidly expanding global kpop fan base, there are significantly more chances for groups to catch wind and take off than ever before. That's why I believe we're currently living in the ""golden era of kpop"". And only time will tell how the story unfolds. ",17,16

Not sure if this has been discussed before but what are some of your favourite (or not so favourite) Japanese songs by Korean artists that are made into their Korean version? (Or vice versa)

For example, in light of IZ*ONE's comeback, I felt the Korean version of 'Gokigen Sayonara' was lacking somehow (maybe it was the repetition of the last syllables that made it catchy in the Japanese version). In terms of favourite - not that I didn't like the Japanese version - but 'Catch Me' by Apink (original titled 'Brand New Days' as the Japanese version) was a good rendition in my opinion.

heres a few of mine:

* rain, his on screen persona being cool, ""untouchable"", a ladies man and so on but hes quite humble and an unbelievably hard worker. He is good at what he does because of the immense effort he put in.


* suga, he is known for being savage and somewhat cold and relaxed in comparison to his group mates but hes a caring person and he is quite happy these days as confirmed by his group members. Im not sure.......why people calll him lazy but he sleeps all over the place because hes staying up making music what do you want from the man?? Also RM said he always fixes things around the dorm and if something is broken before they go to bed, itll be fixed in the morning. To me, i think hes caring and hardworking person 


I might stop using hardworking as a trait because who in this industry ISNT a hard worker?


* Bang Yong Guk, his persona is to be hardcore and no nonsence, wake up with charisma on 100% but on the inside hes goofy and hates cameras. Id like to mention that these days hes giving such a warm, happy, relaxed vibe and it.so nice to see his beautiful smile so often


* Taeyang, smooth ladies man persona esp earlier in his solo career but is shy and quiet and joked about how he would ask other group members to help him get a girl. Also the 'silent rock' type, GD said he is the type of friend who can console you just by sitting there and not saying anything.

Twice and Red Velvet continue to dominate the tournament as all of BlackPink have been knocked out! Round 3 Group A is beginning with some spicy match-ups! 

Its the ""Made in Japan"" duel as two of the Japanese members of Twice, Sana and Momo face off! 

Two triple threats who have even released a [duet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJBHzYHF3z8), Sunmi vs. Seulgi!

Lead singer of Twice vs. lead singer of SNSD, as Jihyo takes on Taeyeon!

And two of the most beautiful visuals in Kpop, Tzuyu vs. Yuqi!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. 

Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",18,24

Racism would be a dealbreaker in any relationship, friendship, Ive cut family members out of my life for racist behavior, yet this issue is still prevalent in kpop. For the record Im not talking about cultural appropriation, but rather blatant racism. 

Some instances Im thinking of include 

-Wendy imitating black people as gangsters and being general disrespectful (these incidents were never acknowledged)

-making fun of foreigners accents, (specifically Christina Confalonieri as well as others, although this was a while ago) 

-various idols saying they can speak black English

-various instances of black face 

-bias against SE Asian kpop idols (receiving unequal pay to their Korean counterparts, general mistreatment) 

-various other incidents 

-some idols who have engaged in racism include  Amber , various members of SNSD, Rap Monster, JB, Chen, Baekhyun, Wendy, and many others. 


The truth is I love kpop, and have been listening to it for a while, but I dont even know how to deal with such incidents as well as fans blatantly overlooking this. I understand theres a cultural difference, but many of these idols promote in other countries and talk about breaking into other countries markets, yet they still act this way. Furthermore isnt it just common sense after all when Exid was mocked for their accents in English, there was outrage in Korea, yet idols feel like they can do the same thing to every other race??? Im still fans of many of the people I listed, yet I cant help but feel very uncomfortable when thinking about their involvement.


So how do you guys still remain fans and listen to the music of idols who have been racist? What standard should kpop idols be held to in terms of racism? As well as what are other racist incidents that kpop idols have been involved in? ",73,0

590,2019-4-3,2019,4,3,11,b8s73y,"BUSTERS in Montevideo, Uruguay (Fan Account)",SirLegolas13,1554257312,"**Introduction**

To give a bit of context, Busters is the first kpop girl group to have a concert in Uruguay and the second kpop group in general (VAV had a concert about a month ago). Partly due to the concert being announced so suddenly, girl groups being less popular overall, Busters not being a super popular group, and the fact that a lot of kpop fans had spent a lot of money attending the VAV concert (Busters concert was shortly after this one, or around that date), ticket sales were a bit slow during the first couple weeks but after ticket prices being slightly lowered, they managed to sell out. (Not sure about the number of people, I think they said it was over 300 but I dont remember exactly)

**Prices**

Tickets werent super expensive, but they weren't super cheap either. I bought them right after they were released and paid about $40 (US dollars). They later went on sale and were about $30. People that had bought it before got VIP passes according to what they had bought (I had a regular ticket, and was promoted to Hi Touch). 
Random ticket-buyers were given a chance to buy a Selfie Pass (I was one of the winners, and it ended up costing me about $30)

**Arriving to the venue**

The concert was held at an event room at a 5 star hotel. The actual room wasnt super big and the sound wasn't amazing but whatever. The seats werent numbered but people entered the concert hall in the order in which they first validated the tickets when entering the hotel, and according to VIP passes. Immediately after entering the hall my friends and I felt kinda out of place since most attendees seemed to be girls between 12 and 16 y/o, while we were 20 y/o guys. Not everyone fell into that demographic but it was a considerable amount. Im assuming thats just how the kpop scene is here. 

**Selfie Pass** 

We went in before the concert and sat down while the coordinators / hosts explained the process and the girls came out and greeted us. We then took turns going up to the stage and took selfies with each of the members. It was really quick, kinda like a Hi Touch but we had a bit more time so I could actually say a couple sentences and stuff and then take a few pictures, which came out great! I think this really was by far the most worth it one of the VIP passes since I actually get pics with each of them.

**The screams, oh god the screams**

Shortly after we went in and sat down (had pretty decent seats), the opening acts started (some local dance cover groups, 2 girl groups that danced Momolands Boom Boom and Produce 48s Pick me, and a guy group that danced some boygroup song i didnt recognize since I dont often listen to that). As soon as this shows started we realized what we were in for. The tween girls started screaming their lungs out at anything that happened, my head started hurting and I was legit scared Id go deaf before Busters even started their concert. This really was the one thing that truly bothered me from the event.


**Busters Concert**

The girls were incredible, even though Chaeyeon wasnt able to attend due to not being released by the TV company shes working with, they put on an incredible show and kept the energy at max the whole time. Min-ji was especially amazing (and not just saying this cause she is my bias). I swear she didnt stop moving from the second she stepped on stage. If they werent doing a song, she was still dancing to whatever song was in the background, or jumping around the stage throwing hearts and waves at the crowd, or enticing the audience to scream more (as if they werent screaming enough thanks min-ji). She is also by far the best dancer in the group, or at least she was in this concert. I also want to give huge props to Ye-Seo, shes super young and very new to the group but she still did amazing and was probably second only to Min-ji in terms of keeping up the energy and communicating with the audience.

The set list was something like this (probably some mistakes since Im doing it from memory):

* Dream On
* Responsible
* LALALA
* Someone like you (Adele cover by Hyung Seo)
* Tonight (Luna Snows song from Marvel Future Fight, who Hyung Seo voices in the show)
* Into You (Ariana Grande dance cover by Min-Ji)
* Group dance cover medley of electronic pop songs I dont remember
* Asereje (Las Ketchup dance cover, I dont think anyone couldve guessed they would do this song in a million years lol)
* Grapes (Final Song)
* DDU-DU DDU-DU (Blackpink cover)(Encore) 

There were also Q&amp;A breaks and a musical chairs game with fans picked by them (which was whatever but we got to see min-ji dance to Boom Boom by Momoland after she got eliminated from the game)

Overall the show was about an hour and a half long (hour forty five if you count the cover groups that opened the show)

**Final thoughts**

The show ended up being incredible, and regardless of whether I thought the screaming was extremely annoying or not, Im happy the Busters girls got so much support, and they seemed to be very happy with the concert as well. They arent super popular, so Im sure seeing they have a lot of fans in literally the furthest possible place on earth must have made them happy. They promised to return next year both on stage and later on twitter and instagram so hopefully theyll follow through with it. Id love to see them come perform again.

Two of our quarterfinals match-ups have already been determined! Tzuyu will battle Seulgi and Sana will go up against Taeyeon in the quarterfinals! But before that we must decide which idols from group B will advance to quarters! Can Joy beat the ultimate Unnie Irene? Can Moonbyul avenge Solar against Dahyun? We'll have to see what the voters decide! Have fun voting!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

I honestly watch these shows as a 4th generation Kpop fan and kinda think they were more entertaining than shows nowadays. 

I was watching Thank you for waking me up with SS501, and its the funniest thing in the world . I would love to see Stray Kids or BTS try this because even though we got reality shows from them, I feel like it didnt showcase their sleeping habits or who wakes up first etc.

Bom repeatedly hinted that she would release new music soon during her recent fansign events, and these coordinated images seem to be a teaser for more new music produced by Brave Brothers. Brave Brothers produced Bom's single album Spring, which was just released a few weeks ago.

The images:

* [From Bom](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzjmD_Hzf2/)
* [From Scotty Kim](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzjnCIHj46/)
* [From Brave Brothers](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvzjz4dh7m6/)

They all tagged each other in their posts, and Scotty Kim included the hashtag \#collaboration in case it wasn't obvious enough. Brave Brothers also included the tags \#44 (April 4) and \#444, so perhaps we should expect more at 4:44 PM KST (it is already April 4 in Korea). Some fans are speculating that they are teasing the release of the acoustic version of Spring, but we won't know for sure until they release more info. What do you think?",20,142

I just wanted to let you guys know that the Part Two (with the new submissions) of Round One of TBSW is finally here! The rules are the same as last time, and voting will last three days. After this round ends, I will get the results from Part One and this part and then Round Two will finally begin. The voting for Round Two will last at least one week so more people could be able to vote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that some songs from Part One repeat here, but the overall results will NOT be manipulated / modified, and they will only get more bonus points if they didn't initially meet the requirement. (Example: Let's say DIA's Like U Like U had 15 points initially. If the song gets voted at least five more times in this part, the song will pass onto the next round. (With 20 points only, no less, no more.)

I was finally able to put everything together, so here I am showing you what I've got.

1. BTS charted in 22 countries around the world. They are the only group able to enter also non-Asian charts, in some Eastern and Northern European countries like Russia and Norway, as well as New Zealand.

2. BLACKPINK charted in fewer countries - 13 -, but they actually did better than BTS in the Songs chart, thanks also to Jennie's ""Solo"". The boy group appeared 9 times on some Asian charts, while the girl group 16 times. (3 times just in Indonesia.)

3. TWICE charted in 11 countries, especially in Japan where they placed 5 songs in the Top 20.

4. Philippines love MOMOLAND, who topped both the Artists and Songs chart. MOMOLAND made it in 5 other nations.

5. We have a few other Korean acts who charted outside of South Korea at least once: PSY (3 countries, including South Korea), RED VELVET (2), EXO (2), GOT 7 (1), BIG BANG (1).

Anyway, I was wondering what other songs have feelings like this?

My favorites:

\- UR and Lonely Night by Taeyeon

\- Vibrato by Stellar

\- Kingdom Come by Red Velvet

\- Red Lipstick by Hyolyn ft. ZICO

Given the title, though, I would also accept some crazy fan moments where they were just overly impressive (though I think there was a thread about this not that long ago).

What I like about them is that: they themselves make their own music, legitimately sing during their performances even while dancing, are given the option to come into work whenever they please because their company, BigHit, wants them to have as much freedom as possible and understands that the members of BTS are only human, and the music and concepts they make is honestly brilliant, refreshing, and mind-opening to me.

I like BTS because they are not afraid to express themselves and are able to do so because they and their company wants change within the Kpop industry and within the world.

I like BTS and the fact that they are each seven strong individuals that are humble despite all of the money that they have because of how low they started in their once miniscule company.

I like BTS and the love and support they give to their fans and when their fans, their Army, returns the love and support, they become humbly flustered and act as though they we are the ones who gifted them with success and glory but they are the ones that changed and opened the hearts of many and even gave people the hearts that they needed.

I really like BTS because of the strong messages they give to people through not only their music but even in the things they do rather than basic songs like ""Oh baby I want you to be mine"" or other such themes like one-sided love or lovey dovey shit from the Kpop industry in general.

I'm sorry but it just seems like other male musical groups within the Kpop industry focus more on enforcing their masculinity and being basic when they sing songs like ""You have a sexy body so therefore that makes me want to claim you as mine, girl"". And the girl groups are typically like ""Well you're gonna have to catch me if you can but I'm a hard catch because I'm TOTALLY not like all the other girls"" as if in response to the boy groups and that shit gets really fuckin' repetitive and therefore boring to me. I'm not saying that all other kpop groups are like this nor am I trying to convince you that you should drop them and listen to only BTS. I'm saying that generally, within the Kpop Industry, companies tend to enforce said basic concepts or themes upon the idols that work for them. But when it comes to BigHit, it seems more like BigHit works for BTS rather than the other way around, and their wonderfully written and composed songs and elaborate concepts that come out of both BigHit and BTS that both group and the company actually work together to create are what I am really inspired by and a big reason why I love and support them.

This is why I only really listen to BTS when it comes to ""kpop"" because their songs are more about self reflection, the struggle of being under authority in society, especially in South Korean society, mental issues, and simply being able to not love someone when you are struggling to love yourself, like, THAT SHIT HITS HOME AND WHAT WE ALL REALLY NEED IN LIFE.

That is why I like BTS.

&gt; *Apologies for a 2nd post. Working from desktop, I forgot to check the previous post's thumbnail. I noticed late that it pulled a thumbnail of Jang Ja Yeon, which felt very wrong under the circumstances. Thumbnails cannot be changed after posting. Therefore, this will be the updated reference post from here on.*

**This is a compiled list of all the significant figures involved in the [Burning Molka](https://i.imgur.com/cU7IURn.png) scandals. It is our attempt to make an easier-to-read breakdown that focuses on the Who's Who of these cases and what they did.**

There are two primary threads to follow in this story. One thread is Burning Sun and the general club culture of Gangnam. This includes illegal activities (drug use and dealing, entrance of minors, sexual assault, illegal hidden cameras set up to film sexual abuse, tax evasion, embezzlement) and police colluding to cover up and/or participate in these activities. The other is the celebrity members of chatrooms sharing molka (illegally filmed videos, especially sexually exploitative in nature). They are intertwined as they involve some of the same people.

The ever-growing web of these stories are happening concurrently with a widespread spy-cam (molka) epidemic (hidden cameras in hotel rooms, public restrooms, etc) as well as a feminist movement (\#MeToo) where awareness is being raised of the patriarchal culture of South Korea, which has facilitated sexual harassment and abuse of women as a 'norm'.

Throughout all cases, there are authority figures (police, politicians, celebrities, chaebols) committing crimes. Due to their wealth, power, and the entrenched corruption of those that could bring them justice--they get away with it.

###What we know:

* **Seungri (BIGBANG and executive director of Burning Sun):**
 * Admitted to charges of distributing/sharing molka.
 * Laughed in reaction to seeing illegal photos being shared in chatroom.
 * Admitted to tax evasion at Monkey Museum.
 * Embezzled funds from Monkey Museum and Burning Sun (tens of thousands of dollars). Charged for occupational embezzlement.
 * (Suspected of providing prostitutes for overseas events in Berlin and Tokyo. Unproven.)
 * Seungri left BIGBANG. Was released from his contract with YG Ent. Retired from the industry. Was largely removed from YG Ent. website and BIGBANG merchandise.

* **Jung Joon Young (singer/songwriter, band Drug Restaurant, TV personality):**
 * Charged with 11 counts of filming and sharing molka of him having sex with women. Arrested.
 * Suspected of soliciting prostitution while filming abroad in Germany (2016). 
 * Jung Joon Young had 23 chat rooms, with 16 people involved.
 * Make Us Ent. terminated his contract.
 * In 2016, he was accused of illegally filming a sexual encounter with a woman without consent, but the charges had been dropped. With the present investigation, it was discovered that police who had been investigating that case in 2016 went to the forensic company working on Jung Joon Young's phone, asking for them to announce that the phone's files could not be restored. The files were never turned over for further investigation.

* **Yoo In Suk/Mr. Yoo (Yuri Holdings CEO):**
 * Resigned from his position as CEO of Yuri Holdings, which is the company founded by both him and Seungri in 2016. It operated multiple businesses, including the Burning Sun club.
 * Embezzled funds from Monkey Museum and Burning Sun (tens of thousands of dollars). Charged for occupational embezzlement.
 * Facilitated prostitution
 * Helped to cover up Choi Jong Hoon's DUI
 * Implicated Superintendent Yoon during investigations.

* **Choi Jong Hoon (FTISLAND):** Bribed police for assistance in covering-up DUI (offered $9,000). Charged with 5 counts of distributing molka and one charge of filming molka himself. Departed from FTISLAND. FNC Entertainment officially terminated his exclusive contract. Retired from industry.

* **Yong Jun Hyung (HIGHLIGHT):** Was in a 1-on-1 chatroom with Jung Joon Young. Admitted to participating in inappropriate conversations about molka. Departed from HIGHLIGHT. Enlisted for military service (190402).

* **Lee Jong Hyun (CNBLUE):** Confirmed to be in chatroom where molka was shared. Admitted to participating in inappropriate sexual conversations degrading women. Currently in military service. He's 'deeply reflecting' and still supported by his agency, FNC Ent.

* **Mr. Kim (non-celebrity):** Employee at Burning Sun. Set up hidden spy cams to film illegally in the club. Arrested
* **Eddy Kim (singer/songwriter):** Was in a chatroom with  Jung Joon Young where molka was shared. He admitted to uploading one sexual photo from the internet.
* **Roy Kim (singer/songwriter):** Was in a chatroom with Jung Joon Young. Booked for sharing a photo (unconfirmed if molka).
* **Kangin (Super Junior):** Was in a chatroom with Jung Joon Young where molka was shared. Police do not plan to investigate him.
* **Jeong Jin Woon (2AM):** Was in a chatroom with Jung Joon Young where molka was shared. Police do not plan to investigate him.
* **Lee Chul Woo (model):** Was in a chatroom with Jung Joon Young.
* **Kwon Hyuk Joon (SNSD Yuri's brother):** Kicked out of group chatroom after being caught doing drugs (marijuana?).
* **Senior Police Officer Superintendent Yoon:** Booked for violating the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act for taking bribes/gifts in the form of BIGBANG concert tickets (from Seungri), a meal and a golf game (from Yoo In Suk). Removed from his position. ( His wife also claimed she received K-Pop concert tickets from Choi Jong Hoon)
* **Mr. Lim (Arena club's CEO):** Arrested for tax evasion (evaded 16.2 billion won from 2014 to 2017).
* **Mr. Kang (Arena club's owner):** Arrested for tax evasion (evaded 16.2 billion won from 2014 to 2017). Believed to have lobbied tax agencies during the tax investigation to Arena last year. He operated 16 clubs in Gangnam.
* **Lee Moon Ho (Burning Sun CEO):** Investigated as a suspect relating to drug use and distribution. Police seized his home and banned him from leaving the country. His arrest warrant was rejected despite testing positive for drugs.
* **Anna (merchandiser/promoter for Burning Sun):** Interrogated by the police under suspicion of selling drugs to VIP clients at Burning Sun. Tested positive for methamphetamine, ecstasy, opium, marijuana, and ketamine.

###Indirect connections:

* **Kim Sang Kyo (non-celebrity):** Filed the original assault case at Burning Sun (he was beaten by Burning Sun staff/security and police officers), which triggered all of the media attention and investigations of Gangnam clubs. ([Statement and background](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b2dr0p/burning_molka_12_jung_joon_young_has_a_second/eiv6472/?st=ju11vses&amp;sh=62f9448a))
* **Kim Hak Eui:** ([Article linking KHE with multiple sex abuse cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b6hl5z/burning_molka_14_seungri_booked_for_sharing_molka/ejs05vr/?st=ju0zzvy3&amp;sh=44997ece))
* **President Moon Jae In** issued emergency orders to thoroughly investigate the scandals that have surfaced: Burning Sun, **Jang Ja Yeon** (actress who took her own life that was sexually abused, as facilitated by her agency), and Kim Hak Eui (former justice minister who was accused of taking sexual bribes, with at least one woman who did not consent). Their commonalities are in privileged individuals participating in criminal activity and sexual abuse while colluding with people in places of power (ie. police, politicians) to cover up and/or take part in said activities. Jang Ja Yeon's case was nearing the statute of limitations, but there was an official extension of two months to continue the investigation.
* **Shim Min Ji (Madame Shim):** Founder and CEO of the luxury fashion brand Linoui ([Koreaboo article all about her connections to powerful figures and suspicious cases of suicide](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/meet-madam-shim-woman-controlling-koreas-entertainment-politics-journalism/))
* **Madam Lin:** Signed investment contract for Burning Sun after meeting Seungri in 2017. Accused of laundering money through the club. ([Koreaboo article all about her](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/seungri-investor-madam-line-scandal-identity-yi-ju-lin/))
* **Hwang Hana:** Chaebol of Namyang Dairy Products. Frequent visitor of Burning Sun. Drug-dealer/user, but has never been punished when caught due to preferential treatment from police. Friends with Choi Jong Hoon. May have distributed molka and used videos to threaten others/victims. Arrested (190404).
* **Kim Hyung Jun (SS501):** Accused of sexually assaulting a bar employee in 2010 (the alleged victim came foward when seeing this whole scandal in the news). He denied the allegations.
* **SHAUN (solo artist and member of band The Koxx):** Enlisted for his military service. He hasn't been accused of anything, but he was a resident DJ at Burning Sun, so received negative attention for the association.
* A PD for the variety show 2 Days &amp; 1 Night (2D1N) was implicated in a chat where gambling was discussed with Jung Joon Young. **Cha Tae Hyun** and **Kim Joon Ho** (members of the 2D1N cast) were also in the chat and are revealed to have gambled while playing golf (gambling is illegal in South Korea). They have both stepped down from all programs they are involved with. 2D1N is now on indefinite hiatus and unavailable for replay. The episodes where Jung Joon Young was on We Got Married (another show) are also unavailable for replay.

###Further investigations:

* While investigating Burning Sun, Police seized 58 phones.
* Commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency held a press conference and revealed the following in relation to the club scandals: 103 people have been booked, 13 people have been arrested/imprisoned. 53 people were booked for drug-related charges (15 booked and 4 arrested for using/distributing drugs at Burning Sun), 9 booked and 1 arrested for distributing GHB

###People on the case:

* **Oh Hyuk Jin and Noh Seung Il (Choi Soon Sil case):** Political journalist and assistant, reported Burning Sun.
* **Lawyer Bang Jeong Hyun:** Received chats from informant. Sent to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (as opposed to the police). Shared them with Kang Kyung Yoon.
* **Kang Kyung Yoon:** Reported Kakaotalk chats of Seungri and Jung Joon Young. Received chats from lawyer Bang (as requested by informant). Investigating Seungri since 2015. In communication with molka victims. ([Watch her interview where she describes her process with the case](https://youtu.be/5rQDA2yUnqo))",0,1

893,2019-4-5,2019,4,5,14,b9n7qg,Whats the song that comes close to perfection but misses it by a hair ?,kbdsct,1554441705,"Im only asking this because Ive alwaysssss wished SNSDs Genie removed the intro with the giggly chatter and the outro with the giggly chatter. Idk, I just feel like it takes away from the overall enticing track. I wish they kept the MV version of how the song starts and ends. Im fine with the cheers and whoops in the bridge (even if Jessicas adlibs should have found a place somewhere) coz it kinda brings a kind of lightheartedness before the final chorus. Anyway, I guess Im nit-picking but its still my fav GG song and my most played Kpop song (Atleast thats what the iTunes play count says). 

Among the more recent songs, Forever Young could absolutely have been perfection, and couldve been my fav BP song if... you know, that whole unnecessary addition wasnt made after the second verse. ",206,101
894,2019-4-5,2019,4,5,14,b9n7zv,Why is Blackpink so popular?,FalafelGrim2,1554441769,"DISCLAIMER: Pretty negative post.

Im genuinely proud that a girl group has finally broken these many records and a girl group is representing K-Pop at this international level. Im not really all too hyped about it being Blackpink.

2016 Blackpink deserved all these accolades - genuinely great songs that did not seem rushed or underkill, great choreography with equally great stage presence, good vocals, etc. 

Todays Blackpink are just a complete shadow of what we were expecting after the top-notch debut - no stage presence, lacklustre choreography and bang-average and overdone songs produced by the same guy. These days, they just look like supermodels who can sing - not what Blackpink set out to be.

Personally, I can see many other groups that couldve been equally or even more popular internationally had they been promoted like how YG promotes Blackpink. Because clearly the starvation of content by YG has meant that fans hype over anything Blackpink drop.

So what do you think makes them so popular that they break into international charts and become pretty mainstream?",2,1

Sequals have often been received with scepticism only to grow in popularity and become the favorite part in a trilogy. This is difficult, especially when the first film stood alone as a finished work of art. There are reasons for follow up successes.

Part 2 doesn't need to introduce characters. This leaves time to look closer at the protagonists and let them develop. This can be a darker side of their personalities, an old wound, or a pressure from outside. 

There doesn't need to be a happy resolution or story ending, since this happens in the third part. This allows for a cliffhanger or an abrupt ending with unanswered questions. 

What you are left with is a reflective and emotional drama. It improves over time and with multiple viewings.",3,0

I've heard both sides. Some people say that if we notice that an idol is looking or acting differentlt that it isnt really our concern seeing as they have a whole life we dont know about and we cant jump to conclusions. But on the other hand some people say that if theres drastic changes and calls for help, if we care about them as a person we should be a little wary of whats going on. 

Personally i agree with the latter a bit more, the former sounds a little bit like dismissal imo and theres lots of times here in the states celebs have reached out on social media for help.....what if all those fans just turned a blind eye and said ""thats not my business""? Beyond this i think balance is important, but to each individual balance means something different, sadly. And different people will find different matters concerning. 


Case in point: im not sure about what signs Jonghyun may have showed outwardly/on SNS/to fans &gt;!before his death that he was contemplating suicide or depressed, maybe Shawols can help me with that. But from experience, people who are contemplating suicide 98% of the time subconsciously (or deliberately) do things to bring attention to the fact theyre gonna do it. Sorta like a last call for help. Drastic changes in someones behavior like them giving away a ton of stuff, suddenly being happy all of a sudden and certain conversation topics are all matters of concern and many people call suicide hotlines just to have someone ""there"" as they die.!&lt;


I dont think i need to go deeper into that but an example i do know about is T.O.P. 
He has overdosed twice on drugs that are impossible to overdose on unless you are deliberately trying to, his members bring up his love of wine and drinking a lot and we know he has a history of depression. Should we really just look at these obvious signs something is wrong and go ""well theres a lot we dont know about behind the scenes so we dont need to worry about it""? We dont need to do anyrhing drastic and demand him to tell us whats wrong or boycott till he explains, but i think its perfectly fine to be somewhat concerned.

Will the lovely IU be able to defeat the game queen Irene? who will win in our second Twice vs. Red Velvet match of the quarterfinals, Wendy vs. Dahyun? The voters will decide! Have fun voting!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Forever young"" will probably never get MV, I think it's a great song...meanwhile ""Kill this love"" obviously has mv and this leads me to the next point:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Kill this love""'s video seems to be trying to copycat the success of Du Du Du Du. The video has pretty much the same feel to it and it seems as if YG must've liked the 700+ million views of this video and are afraid to experiment. Most importantly: I don't like the song, it sounds like german neonazi march sung in korean...

&amp;#x200B;

*  ""Kick it"" is pretty good song, will love to see video of it. Jennie enjoys singing in english  and Lisa's rap is getting even better. Most importantly I like the ""jazz"" sound of the song which reminds me to Mamamoo who are still the best female singers in Kpop in my opinion, so int's interesting BP can compete with them. Again: this amazing song somehow got overshadowed by ""kill this love"" for a MV choice.

It can be in various aspects such as the concepts, the type of music, how the groups were ensembled, etc. 

Like, do you miss Super Junior's more techno/dub sound? Or it doesn't have a place anymore? 

Has the industry really moved on from overly cutesy concepts? Or do you want more of that to come back or still sees too much of it? 

What you do you guys think it changed the most from the 2nd generation onwards that you think it could make a comeback?

989,2019-4-6,2019,4,6,4,b9vb4r,Fan Account: Epik High Toronto 190404 (Raving from the balcony),somericecake,1554491407,"Hi again everyone. It's me, the guy who can't get stop going to concerts because I'm a stupid sucker who loves too many artists and people keep coming here. This is my 3rd concert so far this year after Red Velvet and Tiffany (and this isn't gonna be the last). I went to Epik High's concert back in 2015 which is still the most fun concert I've ever been to. So naturally I was extremely excited to see them again. I'm gonna try and keep this FA more concise than my previous ones since I seem to constantly repeat myself.

So preface, my friend and I got balcony seats for this concert (as is evident from the title) which actually cost more than the floor (the perk being that you can sit and enjoy the concert). In the beginning of the concert, I was meh about being in balcony since I didn't realize how far we'd be from the stage, but I ended up loving it for reasons which will be more obvious later down.

The opening artist was a Toronto-native called Joyia and HMLT (pronounced Hamlet, no seriously). Sorta strange because they were like r&amp;b and indie-ish, but they were pretty good overall. They had a sax player which was cool and the last song they performed was a killer rap song which I still wanna know the title because it was dope.

After that, Tukutz came out and started **In Seoul**, followed by Tablo and Mithra and it was a nice, smooth start to the concert. And then they just go fucking HAM and transition into **No Thanxxx** which was so killer to hear live. I cannot understate how I much I love hearing them rap. The flow, the feels, it's all on point. 

Then they did introductions which reminded me why I had so much fun at the first concert. Tablo introduced Tukutz and made him do 15 different things from mixing to singing to runway walking. 

Then we went into **Burj Khalifa**, followed by **Eternal Sunshine ()**, then **Bleed**. Hands up, grooving to the songs, chanting the chants, and feeling the flow. If you thought Epik High was only gonna perform new material, well then NOPE. Here comes **Love Love Love** and the crowd exploded when this song came up. Chorus was sung very loudly and passionately. 

Tablo then spoke to us again saying that Mithra's feeling homesick despite Toronto being only the 3rd stop in the tour. This should've been the transition to the next song, but someone in the crowd screamed what it was which prompted Tablo to say, ""Oh well I guess we don't have to do it anymore because she spoiled it so thanks."" The amount of trolling is like 2009 Youtube levels. He then asked her where she's from and she said Dubai to which Tablo said, ""Oh so your home IS far away."" 

Transitions into **Home is Far Away** (). Hell yeah. After that, we went hard again with **Kill This Love**. Lights spazzing, water spraying everywhere. Then we go into **High Technology** which was great to hear again live with the buildups of ""Technology, this is HIGH HIGH HIIIIIGH"". Then they did **One** which I didn't know during the 2015 concert and I honestly hadn't heard in so long, but hearing it live has me all up for it again. Crowd exploded for this oldie too (including me). Then afterwards was **New Beautiful** which was another hype song to hear. This whole night so far has just been banger after banger.

Tablo spoke to us again saying that the next song was gonna be their last which prompted someone in the crowd to say, ""THERE's STILL 20 MINUTES LEFT OPPPA"" which shocked Tablo and prompted him to mock her similar to a playful girlfriend. Man, I love these guys. 

**Fan** starts playing which I also didn't know during 2015 and this time I was hoping they would do the dance again AND THEY DID. It was absolutely glorious and could've honestly been the end, but alas there would need to be a real climax. Song ends, *insert encore chants and whatnot here*

Tukutz comes back out. Plays one note and I knew what was next. **BORN HATER** starts. I scream, unzip my sweater to rep the Born Hater shirt I'm wearing and am ready to rock. We're supposed to be sitting down in the balcony area so that we wouldn't potentially block others, but I didn't give a fuck anymore and neither did anyone else really because this song was so hype that everyone was going HARD. Every ""wow"" part was otherworldly because of the energy. This performance was my drug. After that insanity, we went into the actualy last song which was **Don't Hate Me** which was a wonderful way to end it off. Positive feels and all. ""Everybody hates me, but you love me and I love you."" 

Overall, I give this concert a big **hype** out of 10. Epik High made me feel the epik again. I'm glad I wasn't standing around other people because I was able to jam to my heart's content without potentially elbowing and wrecking other people and after born hater, OOOF. I was basically jumping all up in my seat like it was bus driver's seat. Whenever I tried filming something, even though I had a table in front of me for support, I could barely contain myself because I'm banging so hard to the songs. It was shorter than the 2015 concert, but the fact that I jammed to literally every single song is just euphoric. A shorter, but just as sweet experience.

TL;DR: The high is epik",18,105

Don't get me wrong, he's talented and he seems really cool with his members but considering his attitude on Boys24 (saw a snippet of it on the pann choa page) and other things I saw on the Internet, I have my own reservations. I do understand that he was trying to lead like the other big kpop leaders but the fact that Liveworks didn't put him as leader even though he led in Boys24 is making me really... worried? I'm just scared that he's not that kind of good natured guy I think he is

1025,2019-4-6,2019,4,6,14,ba18ty,Is anyone else feeling uneasy about male idols after this past month?,prerna4,1554529247,"Im mostly a boy group follower (nothing against girl groups I like a lot of the music but I havent had a group I click with yet) and after this past month of all the crazy news about seungri, jjy, Roy Kim...I felt kinda weird about the male idols I follow (bts, ikon, nct, sf9). I can listen to the music with no issues, but its when Im watching the tv shows is when I feel weird. Like I know these guys did nothing wrong but theres a weird feeling questioning  if what Im seeing from the screen is who these guys really are in reality. 

I got into kpop a year ago because I felt like I related more to the idols better than western celebrities who feel very distant to me at times. But after all this news, I dont know who or what to believe or put trust in for idols. Roy especially came off as someone who was a good person that ended up not being who he said he was and now Im questioning every other male idol I know that gives off that persona. 

I guess to sum it up my bar of expectations for the character of male kpop idols has been set to as low as the douchey frat boys in my university...and I dont know how to get this weird feeling out of me.",34,0

I started listening to kpop during the IGAB era but of course I went back and looked for everything they did and what had impressed me the most was the RDR era.

It felt mature, like they were bosses and nothing could stop them. And looking at them during this era it feels like they really enjoyed it. It was just 1 year removed from Gee but it was something totally different. 

And the overall look was a killer. Jessica with the blonde hair and black fringes, Yoona with the bangs, Sooyoung with a shorter hair, etc. And the outfits were on point, so badass and I think something that was really different for them. 

Mr. Mr. era is a close second because you could see how much they had growned and mature as artists and women. Plus SNSD in suits? Murder me.

Will Sana be able to defeat Seulgi and put an end to Red Velvet's perfect record? The voters will decide! Have fun voting!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

(My story and explanation inside)",seamer,1554573366,"Sorry for the long text and I am sorry if the question is confusing, please read on and I think you'll be able to understand...

So I started following KPop back in late 2006 . Fell in love with Narsha first and saw SNSD, Wonder Girls, Kara,T-ara etc debut. Became a hardcore SNSD fan and wanted to marry Sunny (she was and is still so cute and funny) even though I am 30cm taller than her. Even though I loved Family Outing, my actual favorite was Invincible Youth because, you guessed it, Sunny! Cried a bit when she left midway in Season 1.

Life was happening very fast, college finished, grad school done, job kept me very busy. I was not a fanatic anymore, by 2012-2013 I was completely out of KPop world :( I moved to Variety from KPop and that too every now and then, only connection was Running Man episodes once a month if I could manage.

2014 saw SNSD OT9 becoming OT8. The SONE in me cried buckets and I went looking for nearest watering hole to drown my sorrows. In one of those visits I met my future wife but that is a story for another day.

Mid 2018 I moved to a less stressful and less demanding job as we were trying to start a family. Plenty of time we (wife and me) had together so we started to watch K Dramas together and I started to catch up on KPop and KVariety world, still catching up actually. Wife is pregnant now and I'll be a dad in August! Yayy!

So here comes the kicker, recently when Iz*One made a comeback I happened to come across their appearance on Idol Room. I saw Honda Hitomi, she's so cute!!! You know what I said to my wife? I want a daughter as cute as her. 

In my mind I still feel like I am in my early twenties even though I am almost 35 now so that thought really surprised and made me realize that I am old and have really become a samchon fan. I was smiling ear to ear just like Defconn and Hyungdon :) Here is the video if you want to see it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzjjPc4eMXI

So if you are from my generation, what changes have you seen in yourself in the last 10+ years when it comes to idols? For me it's been a big one: wanting to marry one to wanting a daughter like one!

His ""Suit UP"" song always hits my soul..it brings all types of different emotions when i listen to it. When i think of him i always remember him during  SHINee World Concert IV or his reaction to minho surprising him on blue night radio. I miss him so much..

1102,2019-4-7,2019,4,7,4,ba7zx9,Some BlackPink Remixes,TheGuysInPajamas,1554579111,"First time posting, hope the links work as expected. For those that didn't like the original (like me) I looked up some remixes and linked them below along with my 2 cents. No mashups, nightcore, bass boosted versions, or teaser remixes though. There were... a LOT of remixes. Too many were just overpowering with their trap, EDM, dubstep, club remixes so I didn't include most of them. 

1. [Areia Remix](https://youtu.be/_ZDTuN6MsEo)
Areia is pretty known for their kpop remixes so I included it but the result is...ok. Definitely not my thing. It's really loud and feels a little too much like a regular club remix. The drops are kinda non existant as well. And the elephant sound ending was kept unfortunately but that seems to be the case with the majority of them. 

2. [Dewei Remix](https://youtu.be/cs0GGlFSoFc) 
Trap remix but actually not overdone. Vocals weirdly fast for the music but not bad overall. 

3. [Black Version](https://youtu.be/AssKK4TMjxI)
This one was the most unusual and really fun. There was a very gothic pirates feel to it. Didn't expect the church bells or the monk chorus in the background.

4. [K-B.TZ Remix](https://youtu.be/9lbSLrjVwa8) 
This was one of the less in your face EDM remixes. Weird to hear this song without all the trumpets. 

5. [12 inch extended](https://youtu.be/ilIeRb8ObFM) 
Most faithful to the original but adds a few embellishments (ex. Jisoo's parts have a stronger bass) and extends the ending. 

6. [D3vok Remix](https://youtu.be/z0gigSYQH_A) 
Probably the most tame one but it fixes a lot of what was wrong. Higher build-up for a stronger drop and no elephant ending. I personally prefer this one. 

There were a lot more but this was just a sample of the remixes available.",1,0

So the way I find new kpop music is by watching people react to kpop music/videos (lol) and came across Vixx and holy shit. All of the songs I've heard so far are absolute bangers!

Now my issue is, the 3 songs that I heard (Hyde, Voodoo Doll and On and On) are not on spotify, so I'm guessing I'll be missing out on a large part of their music by just going through their stuff on Spotify? Any tips, shall I just continue searching through Youtube?

I used to be super into Kpop, but in recent years have not kept up with it as much (I still listen to it a lot, but Im not completely up to date on all the new groups)

My question is, what causes the seemingly huge gap in popularity between Red Velvet and groups like BLACKPINK &amp; TWICE? All of them are the current flagship girl groups for the Big 3 companies, so what is it about Red Velvet that puts them so far behind the other 2? 

I like all 3 of these groups a lot, but I was always curious about the how BLACKPINK &amp; TWICE blew up so fast. Any thoughts?",133,80

Change 'shimmy shimmy kokobap' to literally anything else. EXO's songs are otherwise so tirelessly well-produced, they do all the hard and expensive stuff so right. I don't know who does the lyrics at SM but this sincerely ain't it. I get that in some ways it's endearing to fans? And I get that it'd be hard to write like Bob Dylan-level lyrics or something. But can't they at least go for passable/forgettable/non-specific lyrics that don't raise GP eyebrows? In general, it's really hard to listen to their songs or sing them at karaoke when you understand Korean :(

Irene continued her team killing streak, taking down Red Velvet's lead singer Wendy, and Seulgi defeated the last remaining member of Twice! With this result Red Velvet will remain undefeated for the entire tournament! No Red Velvet member has lost to a member from any other group! Will Irene continue her streak and achieve the final team kill? Or will the powerful triple threat, Seulgi become r/kpop's ultimate bias?! The voters will decide! Have fun voting!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com/) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

I've only recently delved into the K-Pop universe, but already I feel like I've hit a brick wall after being disillusioned by ""Bad Boy"" by BIGBANG. The song is ***too*** good, that nothing else comes close.

I've yet to find a song with a similar vibe and feel. That genuineness and passion. Everything else seems fake in comparison.

Is there any other K-Pop boy band or song with a feeling to it that comes close to ""Bad Boy"", or was that just one of the best K-Pop songs ever produced? ",6,0

What if America used a similar setting? Weekly winners, streaming numbers, live performances, promotion periods. Granted some of these things are already there in America, but like imagine Travis Scott having to perform a title track weekly for about a month on a music show, that concept seems so weird to see for American artists lol.

By the disbandment of Iz*One next two years, Sakura, Hitomi and Nako will be established names in K-Pop; I mean it has only been six months but Sakura is already a fixed member of a TV Show regardless her fluency in Korean. 
Sakura and Nako may go back to HKT48 because they are the aces, but Hitomi IMO will highly unlikely go back to Team 8. We dont know how long Toyota will continue to sponsor Team8, and Team 8 is actually AKB48 at this moment, with Okabe being captain of Team A and all members are spread in Team A, K, B and 4. 
While gaining new fans as Iz*One, I think they are losing their wota too for being absent in 48G. It might be not a good decision coming back to 48G popularity wise; Sakura had been stagnant for almost 2 sousenkyo and Hitomi has never been ranked, Nako is growing tho. I wouldnt be surprised if they go back to 48G then announce their graduation just like what Takahashi did.

But if they do stay in Korea, would they make it? What agency suit them the best?",87,134

However, I do not understand this. Most large groups that have 100M+ views are actually fake: they are individual people streaming and inflating the numbers. Lets say a group has 5 mil fans. If each of them streams 10 times, thats already 50M views, with 45M of those being fake. Why do you count these fake views as accomplishments? Why not celebrate (or critique) the song itself? 

I still hold PSY as the true Kpop idol who broke the view record. Streaming culture wasnt big then and he reigned in views from the pure novelty and catchiness of his song. He didnt need to rely on a large fan base because Kpop was not as big globally as it is now. ",1,2

I have done ticketing since the first time mx toured and it has never been this shitty. I should of known problems would arise as soon as prices dropped. Suddenly we have a vip and prices are shifted, I get it as they get more popular it's going to cost more BUT what I don't get is foxx and ticketmaster up charging regular ticket prices AND adding a whole bunch of fees (foxx!!!). This platinum ticket drama should of never been a thing and idk... powerhouse could of SAID SMTHG (a disclaimer) so ppl would know to avoid that mess. Don't let me get on ph--website crashes during ticketing, disconnet the phone lines, never have clear cut answers the mess can go on and on. It's just frustrating how little these companies care and stay money hungry!",1,0

Seulgi: she doesnt like Seulgi because of her stage with taeyong(who is her main bias). Her exact words were she was a little too close to my man!

NCT jaemin: the very famous [clip](https://youtu.be/U8DHL3aHqQI) of jaemin pushing haechan as a joke since they are friends made her dislike him. She thought he pushed Renjun and said renjun is such an innocent boy and that was so rude of him.

I'm feeling saucy so yall have EXACTLY ~~ONE HOUR~~ 53 minutes to vote and **BREAK THIS TIE**. Voting closes at 1PM CDT!! 


&amp;nbsp;

Now I've decided NOT to tell you what the two songs are ~~because I am a jerk~~ because there is a THIRD song only a few votes away as well, and I think it'd be fun to keep this ~organic~. This could go one of three ways and it's a slow day for me and I feel like putting a time constraint on it (that no one will see) is kinda fun!!!

Thank you to the roughly 100 of you who responded to my [emergency tie-breaker thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bbahxg/emergency_last_chance_voting_rkpop_sings_spring/), it was a success and we HAVE A WINNER!

The results of our closest race ever have [NAVILLERA narrowly beating](https://imgur.com/zCKz8z2) [Me Gustas Tu by a mere 2 votes](https://imgur.com/lLDpwCZ), and Rough falling behind with only 53 after initially trailing RIGHT behind the top two all week. 

^(^PS ^shout ^out ^to ^all ^the ^people ^who ^joked ^about ^making ^us ^sing ^Sunrise ^and ^then ^apparently ^didn't ^actually ^vote ^for ^it, ^my ^vocal ^chords ^and ^relationships ^with ^my ^neighbors ^thank ^you.)

As of the very minute this post goes live, we are **officially opening submissions**! Submissions will (probably) close on **WEDNESDAY, MAY 1st.** This gives those of you in Easter-celebrating regions the perfect opportunity to sing in Korean in front of your family, just like Jesus would've wanted. 

If you have no idea what I'm talking about in this post, here's [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ), here's our [most recent release](https://streamable.com/wx95y), [here's](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b46lxq/update_rkpop_sings_fantastic_baby_cover_cancelled/) where Fantastic Baby went.

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1.** Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13

**Step 2**. Get some headphones and plug them in. We want to hear ONLY YOUR VOICE, not the song too. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is *not* set to that channel, as it's probably inferior to the mic of the computer or phone. 

**Step 3**. Cue up Navillera on either Itunes/Spotify or [THIS link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCQ3i5MMUJQ) on your browser. Notice this is **NOT THE MUSIC VIDEO**, because there is a funky intro to it and we're not messing with that.

**Step 4.** ~~Open this page and scroll down to the officially sanctioned pronunciation guide below.~~ COMING SOON, watch for a reminder post that includes it, and I'll update it here too! (If you're recording before our Official Pronunciation Guide is up (we luv our early birds), feel free to sing along to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCQ3i5MMUJQ) lyric video or [these](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2016/07/gfriend-yeojachingu-navillera-neo-geuligo-na) romanizations.

**Step 5**. Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, hit play on the song, then sing your heart out. Remember that kpop groups are *multiple people*. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, so do a bunch of takes. If this is confusing, the easiest thing to do for this song is to record **each member's part** as a separate track. Basically, use common sense: **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. It's alright if you send us a bunch of different audio tracks! It's *not* alright if you record every single word individually and don't bother to combine them. That's *super* annoying!!!

**Step 6**.  If you wanna sing harmonies and adlibs (highly encouraged) please record those as SEPARATE files and include them in the email. Again, **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. 

**Step 7**. Save your masterpieces as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and **email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com**. If your files are too big (happens often) please zip them up and send us a download (via mega/mediafire, whatever) link. I know it's tempting, but we'd REALLY prefer you **NOT share a google drive link**, the permissions can get confusing. Several people weren't included on Red Flavor because they never responded to my emails begging them to fix the permissions. Don't be that person, it makes me so sad.

&amp;nbsp;

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused or have a question about the process, please post it below. Either I or our audio God/Buddy, /u/rreg29 will answer to the best of our extent.

----

&amp;nbsp; 

**Some general recording tips. (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).**

* Try to minimize background noise as much as possible, unless it's funny, and then we'll use it in the credits. Close windows if they were open, turn off machines if they were on etc. (Please don't intentionally try to be funny).

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) one for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you (and probably use more of your vocals, how about that!)

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider **HAND-MAKING** a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it. 

* Do **NOT** apply ANY effects or filters to your vocal track. The ""pop filter"" we're referring to above is made from a tissue. Send us the raw vocal file.

* It's not *Sunrise* high, but hey folks this song is HIGH. If you are a dude or a low-voiced lady having a hard time hitting even the lower notes, consider singing an octave down! (But DO NOT change the key). That's where I'll be singing!! It's fun down here!

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support. 

*  If you have to go screamo or shouty to hit the notes, back away from your microphone please, and keep an eye on the levels of your recording. If you're super loud (like me!!) drop them a bit so your vocals aren't in the red end of the bar the whole time. It's easier to make quiet vocals louder, than louder vocals quieter. (I personally record the majority of my vocal takes from across my apartment on 50% mic volume and am *still* too loud). 

* All in all, this is a super fun, very high and very fast-paced song, but I believe in us and our abilities and our passion and I think we're gonna do great. Do your best, and don't forget that they actually pronounce the L's in Navillera because it's a made up word.

As always, thanks to the mods, the community, and our team! Stay tuned for the pronunciation guide and hit me with any questions concerns etc. (I don't have the room on my computer to edit [this gif](https://gfycat.com/DimwittedShimmeringErne) so it says ""people confused about r/kpop sings"" over Eunha and ""u/dunechka"" over SinB but please imagine it does.)

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, back in the vinyl record days, a single would be released on a physically much smaller record that only holds one song per side.  B-side is literally the flip-side of a singles vinyl record, and the A-side would be the single.

So in today's digital age, if you have a single that has one other track included on the album, that other track would be the B-side. If the album contains more than two songs, then all the tracks other than the main single would be called album tracks, not B-sides. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a FYI for those who might not know this. These holdover terms from the past are kind of meaningless now, but since people are still using the terms, you might as well use them correctly. Personally I wish they'd come up with new terms for the digital age, but it is what it is.",15,0

Which is awesome of course, music is great. The problem then stems from them either mentioning the group in a livestream or tweet or whatever, and fans will pitchfork and call the artist/person fake fan only likes 1 song using the group to be noticed.  
  
I believe its great for groups to be mentioned and recognized, it helps bring in new listens. On the other hand, I do dislike IF said person just listens to ONE song of a group, and ending it there, and not actually exploring further.  
  
Like recently Ellie Goulding &amp; Red Velvet did a small collaboration, and its a great track! Lil Uzi Vert has also mentioned GFRIEND in his livestreams, yet I dont see any pitchforks when he does it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I understand there might be many errors in the process of translation. Even in this post, there might be some grammatical errors and awkward expressions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to watch those videos for learning expressions for 3 years since they are short and easy to compare in both languages. But some of the translations, they are bot-translated and pasted with profile pictures on the video and uploaded to become a first without a decent review.

&amp;#x200B;

Like swapping the subject and the object when they are missing or uncertain in first view, changed or deleted or suddenly appeared words that doesn't exist originally. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a good thing that you can get the meaning as fast as possible, but their desire to be a first can bring misunderstandings. What do you think about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, I watched some Japanese lyric translation videos and I think they are good qualities, my Japanese isn't good as my English tho.",22,33

1669,2019-4-11,2019,4,11,1,bbo7vu,190410 The Days (Yoon Jisungs Musical) Fan Account,Dessidy,1554914582,"

About a week before I flew to Korea, a friend texted me and said that she was considering going to Jisungs musical and asked if I wanted to go with her. Of course I wanted to! I had this image that Korean musicals song out crazy fast and were impossible to get seats for, but we managed to get tickets for 6th row, on the far left side. The venue was still filled up the day of the musical, so I think we got lucky. 
  
The Days has a bit of a complex plot. Especially for me who understands extremely limited Korean. The plot jumps between 2012 and 1992, and follows the main lead, blue house security officer Jeonghak. Jisung plays second lead Mooyoung, Jeonghaks best friend in the 1992 arc.  
  
The play opens up in 2012, at a Korea-China diplomacy ceremony. The Chinese delegation arrives with a woman that look familiar to Jeonghak. Then he receives some news that brings back the memory of 1992.  
  
Since Jisungs character Mooyoung only appear in the 1992 story arc, I will only describe that part of the plot.  
  
The first 1992 scene is epic. It is at a training camp for security officers, and it starts with an incredible dance number with high jumps, material arts, and choreographed stick sparring. In between the dancing numbers, we are introduced to Jeonghak and Mooyoung through singing. And wow, Jisung looks so good. This styling really fits well on him. We can see his forehead, and he looks more handsome than I am used to from Wanna One days. His voice is lighter than the other lead, but he sings his lines really clear and beautifully. His voice also meshes really well with the rest of the cast.  
  
The first part of the 1992 plotline focus a lot on the bromance between Jeonghak and Mooyoung, where Mooyoung is pictured a bit as a prankster. He teases and tickles Jeonghak to lose his composure. One scene in particular that made the crowd laugh had Jeonghak wearing a cheerleading dress over his uniform, likely because of a lost bet. Mooyoung seizes the opportunity to prank him by pulling his pants down. They all laugh and Jeonghak hurries to pull up his pants as their supervisors walk in. While saluting them, his pants falls down, and Mooyoung struggles to keep his laughter in. As the supervisors leave they all laugh together. Jisung plays the role of Prankster Mooyoung so well, and the smiles and laughs between him and the actor who plays Jeonghak really seem genuine and like he is really enjoying the time on stage.   

There is also a fun scene that takes place in a dressing room, that ends with all male dancers (but not Jisung) dancing shirtless and showing off their abs. It was nice. I am not really sure how relevant that scene was to the plot, but I was glad they had it. It was a good scene. 
  
The plot took a twist by the introduction of The Girl. Her name is never mentioned, and she is a mysterious woman that works as a Chinese-Korean translator, that Jeonghak and Mooyoung is ordered to protect. Both Jeonghak and Mooyoung falls for her, and for once the second male lead actually gets the girl as she ends up falling for Mooyoung. The scenes with Jisungs Mooyoung and The Girl also seemed genuine. First the bashful flirting and playful battle between the two friends on who could get her attention, then the closer interactions with Mooyoung and The Girl dancing, or her falling asleep on his shoulder. I even stopped thinking of him as Wanna One Jisung during the play. He became Mooyoung for those two hours, which is really impressive considering how familiar his Wanna One persona is to me.  
  
As someone attempts to kill The Girl, she and Mooyoung escapes. During the escape, Mooyoung gets shot. Even while injured, he is still able to protect The Girl, and they flee together. While on the run, Mooyoung realises that he will not be able to keep up as their attackers are closing in. He tells The Girl to escape and that he will divert them. As she leaves he starts writing a letter, put it in a bottle, and throw it far away. Then he sets off an explosion, killing himself and making it impossible for anyone to keep chasing after The Girl.  
  
In 2012, the plot has taken the characters to the spot where the mysterious explosion took place 20 years ago. They find Mooyoungs letter and finally get an explanation to his and The Girls disappearance in 1992.  
  
In the ending scene, we return to the very first scene again. This time we recognise the familiar woman from the Chinese delegation as The Girl. She asks Jeonghak about Mooyoung, and Jeonghak is able to hand her Mooyoungs letter. As she starts reading, the lights dim and they all freeze. A single spotlight turns to the side, as Jisungs Mooyoung walk in and walks up to his old friend and his past lover. He smiles watching them read his letter, at peace that his story finally was discovered, and leaves.  
  
For the encore, the entire cast is introduced, and then sings the lalalala song from the dressing room scene and does a silly dance. Jisung kept smiling and laughing with the cast and really shone. The cast got standing ovations from the audience, with lot of applause and cheering.  
  
I did not know what to expect from Jisung when I walked in, but his performance really blew me away. He had really good chemistry with the cast, and both his acting and singing were really good. He had several solo songs in the musical and really shone in them. For those two hours he really became Mooyoung. I really hope he will get casted in more musicals once he returns from the military. I can definitely see him having a future in musical acting.",0,32

I'm a 16 (almost 17) years old boy living in Germany. I'm listening to kpop since the end of 2015. I thought it could be quiet interesting for some how it is to be a fanboy, since the kpop community has a huge female fanbase.
So you can ask me some questions I'll try to answer honestly. I also would have one or two stories I could tell about problems as a male kpop fan caused by our society (maybe more the society in Germany, because I think this whole thing is more ""appreciated"" in the US).
So don't mind asking (if anyone does see this post xD).",1,1

1677,2019-4-11,2019,4,11,3,bbpsfc,Lets talk Line Distribution!,sleepydvamain,1554922296,"I wrote a whole essay about Super Junior lines in the comments yesterday, so Ill copy it here for convenience sake: 


Its mostly their vocalists that get the most lines (Ryeowook, Yesung and Kyuhyun.) Normally its Kyu or Wook who get the most, but with Yesung he very easily racks up time with how many ad-libs they have him do towards the ends of songs. Kangin and Sungmin get their lines, but Kangin doesnt get a lot usually.

Sometimes Donghae or Eunhyuk get a lot, rap wise, like in songs like Mamacita or similar. Heechul usually gets his own dedicated verse (Magic &amp; This is Love) and Leeteuk usually does that with him or he gets his own little bits like in Mr. Simple and to a degree Sexy Free &amp; Single. (Together they have verses in Bonamana and Dont Don.)

Siwon, Leeteuk and Shindong normally get the least amount of lines.

Leeteuk its kind of complicated, but he normally doesnt get many lines in songs. The only song I think he has the most (title tracks wise) is Animals and though he has a beautiful singing voice they dont show it off too much and he usually gets pushed off as sub-rapper.

Siwon is sort of the face of the group, so you could argue theres a reason he gets so few lines, but he has just as good a voice as anyone else in SJ so it frustrates me how little he gets. You can especially see this in their older songs like Bonamana, Mr Simple, and SFS as he usually has the opening lines and then he centers in the chorus. It just rubs me the wrong way how they use him has almost purely a visual.

Shindong is the one to almost always get the short end of the stick. Not only does he normally get the least lines, he barely ever gets screen time. In Opera, I genuinely didnt know he was in the video until I watched it for the 4th or 5th time. Its honestly ridiculous. As for lines in songs, he has some of the least, and theres a video where theyre talking about the group and disbanding for a prank (SD was in on it) and Hyukjae said that he had gotten in arguments with their producers to share their rap parts because he wanted SD to get more lines.

They use his voice more for their Suju-T and H songs which are more comedic in nature like Rokkugo or Pajama Party, and I do think his voice fits those things better but its really dissapointing how little he gets. Also, it feels like SM only treats him as a joke or a sort of comedic relief in SUJU, they always have him wear the most ridiculous outifts (which hes complained about before, see their buzzfeed video) or like I said he only gets lines in songs that are supposed to be funnier or not taken as seriously and you can definitely see it in the station song he did a few months ago.

So yeah SM has a huge issue with line distribution because as it seems, and no hate to the members because its truly not their fault, that most songs ar written with KRY in mind.

 

Yesterday I asked a question about members dislike concepts they were doing and the topic of lines arose, so I wanna know, what are your feelings on line distribution in your bias group/s ?",91,29

This Youtuber usually talks about various topics that are not related to kpop or music at all, but she is Korean and knows a bit about kpop. She's always doing interviews/discussions with various people that are in the field of magick/occultism. 

This time she decided to do a 'reaction video' to this ATEEZ MV while discussing with this man who happens to be in the musical field. Then the topic diverges to Japanese music and Depeche Mode and kpop/ATEEZ are only briefly mentioned again.

Other kpop artists that are briefly mentioned/shown : SNSD and BTS.

I would love if Blackpink released a song like Salute by Little Mix, maybe with a cool rap segment added in between. I've always hoped Blackpink would develop a sound like that!

I can see Crush releasing a song like Starboy by the Weeknd. Maybe Dean too. 

T-ara has great electrobops, and I think that Mr. Saxobeat by Alexandra Stan or Can't get you out of my head by Kylie Minogue would definitely suit them as well.",23,29

1817,2019-4-12,2019,4,12,0,bc1fev,Should fans of the members effected in the scandal be forgiven?,DawnOfLevy44,1554997611,"I'm not sure if this is necessarily the right place to discuss this, so please let me know if this is out of line. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Burning Sun scandal has rocked the Kpop community, and it has brought a lot of uncertainty and fighting about whats happening and who did what. But the issues of this scandal go far beyond what is actually being discussed in the scandal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like it or not, the scandal has brought Kpop related news to the mainstream light, as a few news outlets that are non-kpop related have talked about it. This means that their will be people who's first impression of the industry is this scandal, and then their will be those who will use this as just another reason why the industry as a whole is bad. This rhetoric is going to (and has already) started. We as a community cannot be seen as a cesspool of whiny stans and flame wars about different groups. The hardcore stans that are seen on twitter and YouTube already give the impression that every fan is an obsessed teenage girl who is impossible to talk to. We cannot show that that is the way the fandom is. We need to be united in calling this situation what it is, horrible, disgusting, and not tolerated in this fandom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now on the note of fans of the members caught up in this, I think that their is nothing wrong with having supported these guys in the past. I myself am not a fan of any of the groups that have had members caught up in this, so I do not know the pain. But continuing to support them despite these things they have done, is not necessary. In my opinion, no one has to apologize for having supported or liked those like Seungri in the past. It does not reflect on you for having liked them when their was no scandal. To pick an example from outside Kpop. I loved Kevin Spacey, he was one of my favorite actors of all time. But after his whole scandal, I could not support him anymore. However, I do not apologize for having idolized him and being a fan. I won;t support him now, but I have no regrets of doing so before the scandal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of this is for the other fans like myself. Do not hate on the fans of these guys in this scandal. Like I said, we all need to be unified here. If we continue to demonize those who may still enjoy bigbang, or other groups effected, then we are making those fans double down, and sewing more seeds of disunity in our community. 

&amp;#x200B;

What does everyone else think? Should these fans apologize for having supported these artists in the past?",6,0

&amp;nbsp;

####Copyright Stance of the Subreddit

This is a tough subject to deal with respect to the subreddit. We are always toeing the line in regards to copyrighted material that appears on the subreddit. 

Earlier this year, a situation occurred on our subreddit that resulted in Reddit, as the platform, receiving a copyright notice for a bot that was frequenting our subreddit. The bots purpose was to wholesale copy and paste articles, as in word for word, from a western news site that covered K-Pop. The bot was allowed to run freely on our subreddit until March when it was subsequently banned by us. 

That bot repeatedly had its content removed. What we, as mods have learned from other subreddits is that users themselves receive copyright notices, not the subreddit until there is a serious issue. However, we do not wish to get to the point of a serious issue and we wish to obey [Rule 8 of Reddits sitewide policy agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) to protect our users, moderators, and the health of our subreddit. 

**What this entails?** 

It means that wholesale copying and pasting is no longer allowed, but quoting parts of articles for commentary is still entirely welcome. Many of you have been adjusting to this already, and we appreciate this, thank you for being gracious about it. 

Due to the nature of how we are changing our copyright stance on the subreddit, we are also changing how we handle Twitter translations. This subject has already been a confusing ground on the subreddit to begin with.

Moving forward, here are the **guidelines for Twitter translations**:

&gt; One line article translations such as translating the title, lede, byline or just summarizing in one line are BANNED. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bullet point summary translations of articles are BANNED. 
&gt; 
&gt; Full translations of articles are allowed with the expectation that the user will submit the source article as the primary link for the post. The Twitter submission should then be linked in a top-level comment by the submitter along with an archive.is/ backup of the tweet(s) in question in case they are deleted or the person who wrote them locks their Twitter. Please make an attribution to the translator in your comment. Therefore with this change, do not copy Twitter translations wholesale and post it as a comment.

Just recently, we honored the takedown request for a Twitter translation that did not properly attribute the original Translator. We understand as a moderator team that our stance on copyrighted material as it appears on the subreddit will evolve. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####Introduction of new Link Flairs

New link flairs for the subreddit.

This one is a long time coming for the subreddit. We are now introducing a new link flair CF which will deal with the CFs being posted on the subreddit. The Misc tag was getting overcrowded with CFs. It was time to branch out. 'CF' is shorthand for Commercial Film, which refers to any advertisements or commercials selling or promoting a product.

**What are the guidelines for submissions to fit the CF link flair?**

&gt; Promotional images of artist(s) promoting advertisements
&gt;
&gt; Promotional video of artist(s) promoting advertisements

The CF link flair will deal with media associated with promoting advertisements. There is a grey area where promotional images appear in magazines. Those kinds of link submissions will be allowed.

One more additional link flair we are introducing is Tour News.

**What are the guidelines for submissions to fit the Tour News link flair?**

&gt; Tour announcements 
&gt;
&gt; Tour ticketing information
&gt;
&gt; Tour merchandise
&gt;
&gt; Tour related news in regards to arenas or stadiums selling out

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####Toxic Behavior

As the subreddit continues to grow, it becomes harder and harder to maintain a healthy community. Therefore, we will be taking harsher actions against people who break Rule 10 and violate the Conduct Rules for the subreddit.

Do not use hateful words, do not personally attack others and do not purposefully incite negative responses from other users.

Do not use any words that can be considered as hate speech. These words can be sexist, ableist, racist, homophobic, prejudiced, or any other word that is about intrinsic properties of real people. They do not have to be applied to someone directly for us to consider them hate speech.

**Hate speech as defined on dictionary.com**: 

&gt; Speech that attacks, threatens, or insults a person or group on the basis of national origin, ethnicity, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.

Do not personally attack people. Users can argue with the points that people make but refrain from calling them any sort of name. The moment the conversation transitions from arguing about points to arguing about the person making the argument, you are causing a problem.

If someone personally attacks you, do not engage with them.

Do not post comments just to provoke a negative reaction from someone. Dont try to make someone angry or scared or sad. Engage with users and topics positively.

Wed like to ask you all to **use the report button when you see this type of behavior on the subreddit**. Its understandable to feel that reporting can be useless as moderators see it as an anonymous report, but they are really helpful to us. The subreddit is getting larger and its harder to police every single comment thread for bad behavior. We are asking you to bring light to unacceptable comments that you might encounter on the subreddit by reporting them, so that it gets the moderator teams attention.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

####Blind Speculation and Witch Hunting

Do not promote or engage in Witch Hunts. Don't rile up the community against a person or organization. There have been times where people have wrongly accused people and the pitchfork mob has gone out in full force, only to find out that there was nothing to pitchfork. 

Furthermore, its best not to add speculations such as I hope (person) is not involved or I wonder if (person) knew during scandals as it can implicate people as being involved, or being victims and lead to further rumors or witch hunts. These sorts of comments will be removed in the future as they were in Burning Molka threads. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

####This Weeks Stickies

As the Burning Molka situation continues to evolve, our current subreddit sticky schedule has been thrown into disarray. The Burning Molka megathreads are now a permanent fixture as one of our two stickied posts on the subreddits front page.

As a moderator team, we thought that we could use the same idea as This Week in K-pop but for the scheduled sticky threads. Hence, the creation of This Weeks Stickies. We had a serious problem of trying to shuffle too many threads in and out the one available sticky spot. It wasnt feasible anymore. Users also got (understandably!) mad when we unstickied the Burning Molka megathread for one of those posts.

If you like to participate in voting tournaments or our weekly scheduled posts like the Monday Q&amp;A or Friday Free-For-All, make a habit of checking This Weeks Stickies. Everything you need will be there. This Weeks Stickies will be a permanent addition for the subreddit as we continue to cover Burning Molka.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####Charts and Achievements Poll

Our rules for charting, records, and achievements have evolved a lot over time in this subreddit. Despite our efforts to improve them, they continue to be a point of contention. As moderators, we even find the rules difficult to navigate. As much as we want everyone to participate in Town Halls, we recognize that the pressure for rule changes in those discussions might be coming from a vocal minority. We are not completely confident our rules reflect the wishes of our active users. For that reason we want to have a more accurate understanding of what the subreddit wants.

You can think of this poll as an a la carte menu. For each type of achievement, you choose what you want to see in our subreddit. If you want a refresher about the currently standing rules for achievements, please see the following:

* [The Charts &amp; Sales section of our /r/kpop Content rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_.2Fr.2Fkpop_content)
* [December 2018 Town Hall Follow-up 2: Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a5cti4/december_2018_town_hall_followup_2_electric/)

Fill out the poll here: [poll.redditkpop.com/](http://poll.redditkpop.com/)

Poll instructions: The poll will ask you to authenticate with your Reddit account. We are checking that you have accounts that are greater than a year old. We are not logging what your actual Reddit account is. The poll is anonymous, filled with questions and optional answers in multiple choice format.

We plan to make an automated Charts &amp; Achievements post once per week where users can submit what they want to discuss as top-level comments. This will likely happen regardless of the results from this poll.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.

For example we all know how good Lisa (BP) is, but I never really noticed how good Rose is until this latest comeback. I don't know too much about dance but after watching the live stages and dance practice I think she's probably the 2nd best dancer in BP. While she might not have the power that Lisa has, there's this kind of grace/elegance to her moves. 

And it got me thinking, generally we all know who the best dancer in each group is, but who do you think is the 2nd best/under looked. If the main dancer in your bias group left, who do you think would take his/her place?",216,94

1879,2019-4-12,2019,4,12,14,bca2z8,"What do you think about the accusations of ""fethization"" of Asian men/women?",swater63,1555048018,"As an Asian woman myself, I sometimes wonder about fethization. I'm not saying it isn't a real thing, but at times I will think: What's the difference between liking a blonde, blue-eyed woman and an Asian woman? Why is one a preference and the other fethization? Obviously, if some has preconceived notions about Asian women, like they're more submissive, obedient, dependent etc., I think that's problematic. But what if you just like how Asian people look?

Moreover, I've heard about a lot of people, talking about how problematic fetishization of k-pop idols is. And again, I'm wondering about what the difference is between loving One Direction and a k-pop group. While girls loving One Direction was often mocked and talked about derisively, girls who love k-pop are always labeled as problematic for specifically ""fetishizing Asian men"". Why is loving other races called fetishization?

Furthermore, I can't help but see some double standards and hypocrisy here. Mainly, because people on Reddit (majority men, I assume) are rarely extremely outraged by the depiction of lesbians or women in porn/hentai, which is largely intended for men's viewing pleasure. While women shipping men is ""problematic"" and ""fetishizing"" (fan fiction and in general) any criticism about of how women/lesbians are portrayed in porn/movies/tv shows is dismissed as you being an ""oversensitive SJW/feminazi"". To me it seems like most of them only call it problematic, when it's convenient for them; if it's not convenient, you're just an ""oversensitive"" or ""SJW/feminzai"".

To be clear: I'm not necessarily saying some of these things can't be problematic, rather I question why something is labeled as problematic and hated with fervor, while other things that are criticized are just ""oversensitive"" or ""SJW/feminzai"". I also question how we use the word ""fetishization"" as a label.

**NOTE:** 

For those who are curious as to why this event is in Indio and not Los Angeles, the companies behind the event (JSJ Entertainment and Kpopticket.us) most likely have a contract with that venue, so pretty much all of the Korean music events they host will definitely have a concert there. 

They are also the companies behind the B.A.P Forever 2018 Tour and the Oh My Girl 1st USA Tour. Anyone who went to those tours will know what I'm talking about but expect little to no promotion and poor communication. If you know anyone who'd be interested in attending please let them know.

nothing wrong with any of that.

but when i see that the first 10 hot posts on this sub are all about BTS, followed by more BTS with the odd non-BTS post in between, it's a bit much. maybe we could make a megathread about this?

In the 'trap scene', I realised that korean call that thing 'Mouse trap', and English users call that 'Bear trap.' 

In both language there are words meaning 'Mouse trap' and 'Bear trap', but because of the environment, the frequently used word is different, I think. 

And Korean barely (actually never) use the word 'Beartrap.' Even if we sometime use 'Tiger trap.'

Anyway, this kind of differences make learning so interesting.

Do you know similar case of this? Let me know them.",1,1

1976,2019-4-13,2019,4,13,2,bcgkdx,Western Music Will Not Be Able to Compete with K-pop Popularity-Wise in a Few Years,imperiacognati,1555091517,"I could be completely wrong here but I'm going to put this out there. The kind of international popularity of BTS and Blackpink have not been found in western artists in a long time where such a huge number of people are collectively obsessed with these groups and give them unadulterated support. I think they're already more popular than say, Travis Scott ever could be and that's a big thing. Let's take a more popular example than him: Post Malone. I'm willing to bet that there aren't as many Post Malone fans as there are BTS or BP fans even-though his songs are more popular than theirs. So, outside of music, BTS and BP must already be selling more merchandise, getting more youtube hits, selling more albums internationally, and soon enough, they'll also be selling out more shows. The last western acts that commanded fandom dedication like BTS and BP were Eminem and Justin Timberlake. So, I think as time goes on fan dedication is going to overpower the opinions of the western general public because the former will get emphasized more by the industry itself.

And, for the most part, musicians are going out of the general public's good graces in the west more and more. Popular music and pop musicians are scoffed at by half the population. This might turn around but most likely not. Because the industry is far too large and spread to thin in the way that everyone has their own niche band/rapper that they're into. So,   it seems likely that dedicated fandoms will become the main way of making money in the music industry.

Not to mention that around the world, people are getting more and more access to the internet and they will give money to their favourite artists. East asians, south east asians and south americans make most of the dedicated fans around the world. So, naturally, this also puts non-western artists in favour, in the age of the internet and Kpop acts are not only the most popular non-western acts in the world, they're also masters at fan engagement. Hence, they'll be getting more and more popular from here on out. 

Tldr; International popularity and dedicated fandoms are going to be better for business in the music industry, and Kpop acts already excel at building dedicated fandoms, so naturally Kpop is going to win the popularity contest and thus become the main characters of the music industry.",70,0

Three acts I really want to hear from again are Wings, I, and Yuseol. Wings were a duo signed under Sony Music Korea I think, and they released Hair Short (whole bop) and Blossom before disappearing. I was a soloist under WM Entertainment, and is the younger sister of B1A4 member Baro (her debut was also a bop). WM debuted her, but then barely promoted it, and she hasn't been seen since. I think she left late last year, so there's a chance she could comeback under a different company. Yuseol was a soloist that debuted under New Plan Entertainment about a year ago with Ocean View (another bop, could have been a LOONA b-side). She released a video for Korean Thanksgiving, but it's unclear what she's doing now, and Ocean View has disappeared from Spotify, so idk.",135,87

It's not set up quite yet, but we'll post like this today to show how this will work going forward. We are also continuing the relevant [poll](http://poll.redditkpop.com/) (PLEASE VOTE!) to the end of this month, so which achievements are allowed to be posted on their own is still to be determined by those results.

The only things I have right now are:  
Yoongi is very reserved like a cat and is extremely passionate about the music.   
Jimin used to be a dancer and didn't learn how to sing until he became a part of BTS. Also he was insecure about being effeminate at first.

This is very depressing because nobody listens to this music anymore. While there are people like this, somewhat, they are nearly impossible to find because there aren't any subultures and fandoms to this genre. However, there used to be such in 2000-2007 or around this time. 

Iam basically a dinosaur in terms of modern day teenagers. (I am 17). I think that if I become a k-pop fan I would have more friends, less complaining about life, and easier to find people in general. Maybe k-pop to 2019 is what my favourite music is to, say, 2004?",26,0

MBK recently debuted 1The9, the group that debuted from survival show Under Nineteen. I had no interest in the show or this group until I listened to their pre debut and debut tracks, and they are actually really good (Spotlight is a bop). The problem is the music videos: MBK could have gone simple with them. The Spotlight mv has all of these random cuts in the beginning, going from an intro, to a snippet of another track called The Story, to the start of the song, to a second start to the song. It was as confusing as it sounds. MBK's past survival show groups, UNB and Uni.T, also didn't get a lot of promotion, and only one comeback before they disbanded. MBK also messed up DIA during their Woowa era by not releasing their physical album for a week or so. MBK also postponed this comeback multiple times without informing the fans.",0,1

I think a fan doesnt have to be there all the time. They can have music they dont like. They dont have to know the fanchants to every song. A fan is someone who is able to tell you great things about them, will cheer them on through the computer screen and comment supportive messages. I think that is what makes a fan.

However, do any of you just get upset when you think of all the allegations surrounding him? He literally had so much fucking going for him and it just infuriates me that he threw it all away to be a disgusting human being. I get angrier when I think about jaejoong and junsu who worked way too damn hard to work on their image and rebuild their presence in the industry (despite being blacklisted by SM) for yoochun to just tarnish the image they've built as JYJ. I just thank god junsu and jaejoong aren't being seriously affected by yoochun, but I can't imagine how difficult it must be for them to see their group member/brother spiral out of control.  

It feels worse bc he was one of my biases in DBSK and I never know how to feel when he gets dragged in to another allegation/scandal. It feels awful seeing someone I adored turn out to be such a monster. I don't understand the other fans still holding out for him and supporting despite the damning accusations and fishiness surrounding him. I just wanted to see if anyone understands how I feel bc its so difficult seeing him make headlines almost every time for a scandal. I'm just tired and I want yoochun to just stop at this point. I just want him to admit the truth (regarding the drug scandal atm) and go into retirement bc its pitiful seeing him at this point.

Serveral of the tweets also calls out YG and Blackpink/Blinks because armys think that they are the reason behind the views deleted from the 'Boy With Luv' MV because ""YG paid YouTube"". We'll see what happens but the most realistic thing is that the views that YouTube deleted were malicious views from things such as viewbots for example, although it doesn't seem like armys are buying that reasonable explanation and **SOME** continue to be delusional thinking YouTube has a endetta against BTS.",9,0

\-At least 1 or 2 members who speak English. 

\-LOTS of variety content whether on a tv show or hosted on their own social media channels.

\-Strong performances. I think international fans appreciate strong concepts and dancing more than kfans. 

Obviously there's international fans beyond English speakers and English speaking countries but that's the type of international fan I'm choosing to focus on since it's what I am(and I'm assuming most of us here are). But feel free to mention ways to build strong fanbases in other areas outside of Korea were kpop is popular.

I believe this is the first time Epik High have played D.C. and it was a pretty special show. Tablo's sister and brother in law were in the audience because they live in Virginia ~~(like me so let's be friends)~~ so he talked about her for a little bit. During another talk, a group by me starts screaming as Tablo is talking and he turns to them and says, ""you sound like you really need to be heard so what is it?"" Turns out this girl brought a sign for Tablo to see. The crowd passed the sign through the crowd to Tablo on stage. He sees it, laughs and tries to hide it from the members. This fan had made a #11YearChallenge sign with a picture she took with Tablo in 2008! [He gets in the crowd to go take another selfie with her.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwLtZYbjGZY/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=mlbaaihkvibh) I am so surprised and imrpessed with their performance awareness. Tablo even saw and called out a girl in front who dropped her phone. All the members were walking around slapping hands of fans and getting into the crowd with them while performing. It was one hell of a show.

They played a fucking great set. I think it was a perfect blend of fan favorites, new songs, and classics. Below is a list of all the songs I remember (again not chronological because nope):

* Kill This Love
* New Beautiful
* Don't Hate Me
* Fan
* High Technology

FIrst time experimenting with us here in the ~~test kitchen~~ Jukebox? Here's a quick guide! Each week on Jukebox there are seven songs up for review. Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Whether it's praise or criticism, feel free to say whatever you want! **Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself.**  
Alongside your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10. 1 being this song was NOT scientifically accurate, 10 being this song had you going ""WOW!"" the entire time. If a song has a [MV] tag in front of it, you may review the MV and use it to inform your review on the song, but that's totally optional and up to you! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

Song reviews are open up until this Friday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, just try to get them in by then!

I follow a lot of groups and, most recently, I have seen a LOT of fellow ARMYs getting incredibly angry with YouTube deleting 10mil + views, saying that it is a personal attack on BTS, and that they ""worked hard"" to get the views where they are. I am an ARMY as well, but this seems absolutely wrong to me. For one, it happens with every single MV (especially popular ones, recently with NCT and BP).

  
However, the main thing that really bugs me is that view counts should represent how much they are actually watched for enjoyment. Using one of the streaming methods they have (watching on  multiple devices at once, watching one MV over and over with 2-3 other MVs in between, putting a playlist on repeat on mute, etc) JUST to gain more views on a MV makes absolutely no sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I myself have probably watched the Boy With Luv MV 20 times over the last few days, but that was because I wanted to watch it, not because I wanted the view count to get to 100 mil. I do not understand how this can represent real popularity, other than showing how insane fans can be. I love BTS a lot but I always think about the fact that they break records on YT views because of these invalid methods.   


On top all this, many people are harassing YouTube via email and Twitter, saying they are unfair and biased etc, when really the staff are just doing their job and weeding out the illegitimate views. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long ramble, but I had tried to have this discussion with some people on Twitter and, as always, just got attacked by ARMYs who insinuated that I wasn't a fan at all. I thought maybe reddit might be a better place to actually discuss this.

i'm curious how many of you find commonalities between your biases from different groups. i'm not just talking about their official positions in the group, whether you tend to like vocalists, rappers, dancers, or whatever.

more like, do you tend to favor idols with similar personality traits? are they cutesy and sweet or dark and edgy? are they goofy and playful or more serious? are they the shy/quiet type or are they the mood maker/mc type?

obviously, idols are people, so they have complex, multi-faceted personalities just like us! but to the casual observer seeing your groups for the first time, what would they have in common?

i was thinking about how my two ult bg biases, minhyuk from mx and j-hope from bts, have a lot in common in this way, even though they're a vocalist and a rapper/main dancer, respectively. they're both loud sunshine boys who really shine on variety shows.

i also find it interesting when people's biases from different groups are *completely* different from one another! i guess i'm just interested to see if y'all have a favorite ""type,"" and if you do, has anyone managed to bias wreck your type? (~~hyungwon pls~~)",159,36

Even at their strength, YT views, KTL looks to be quickly surpassed by BWL, just like DNA quickly left AIIYL in the dust back in 2017 and opposite to 2018 where DDDD outviewed both FL and Idol. Not to mention their status as future ""legends"" will become increasingly questioned when they have yet to win a daesang (and will most likely not win again), while groups like BTS, Exo and Twice all have won 10+. Some keep talking about Coachella but let's be honest, it's just a festival. They won't get any significant boost from it. Saying they are ""targeting the west"" is not a valid excuse, they would have to do much better to offset their korean underperformance.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it feels like they are at a crossroads, much more than after coming from that one year hiatus following AIIYL. The gap between BTS and them internationally has increased and they are still not known by western audiences to be relevant enough while they basically punted on trying to become the top GG in Korea despite their successful results in 2018, meanwhile Twice are coming and will keep cultivating their strong korean fanbase, while kblinks were left in the dust without even getting fansigns. It feels like they are in the same situation as the Wonder Girls when they went to America. WG left Korea, Korea forgot about them for SNSD and 2NE1, will they do the same to BP and look to new groups such as Itzy, whose debut single outcharted KTL and had 9 music show wins? Sure it looks possible if they keep going for that western pipe dream and especially if their next comeback takes close to a year to happen just like the last two (which would basically mean they could go over 18 months without a real korean comeback, since 3 music show performances barely counts as one), and my guess is YG is not pleased with their numbers in Korea, if it took them 10 months to return following a national hit, how long will it take after a flop? He could even ditch them for a new GG.",1,0

The greater number of people newly exposed to K-pop also means that they will be comparing it to music more familiar to them. 

If you were trying to introduce (ehem, convert) your friends to liking your fave groups by using, say, a Western artist as an example, which artist would it be? Or maybe you have a fantasy collaboration in mind! It could be based on their style of music, talents, personalities, or more.

What I have so far:

**TWICE - Carly Rae Jepsen**

Both are well-known by the general public for their upbeat, viral-level earworm love songs with incredibly catchy choruses (think Likey vs I Really Like You). Singing style seems pretty similar to me, singing in a sweet, charmingly cute voice. Some may dismiss them due to the cutesy or girly concept, but fans who delve further into their discographies are rewarded with quality songs that are pretty different from their singles, usually being slower and more heartfelt but no less impressive (for me, Sunset, 24/7 vs Emotion, Run Away with Me).

**BLACKPINK vs Taylor Swift** 

Not all that familiar with either artists' behind the scenes haha. However both seem really sweet in real life, but are able to project a dark, badass vibe in their really well-produced music videos and performances. Fans are also numerous and incredibly devoted; these artists are digital monsters in their respective domains, especially in terms of streams and MV views.

What are your thoughts for your respective bias groups?",10,6

2439,2019-4-16,2019,4,16,14,bdqae3,Sexism and Female Respectability in K-pop,kpopislifer1b,1555393404,"So I have been into k-pop for about 10 years and as I have gotten older, I have realized that there is a lot of sexism in the Korean entertainment industry. The female idols are not allowed to show too much skin or are attacked, and there is (at times) a negative view on plastic surgery. I also noticed that the women have to be extremely consciouses of their body, such as in interviews and covering their legs with a blanket. Or even have to cover their skin at moments if it is too showy.  They receive more hate for things revolving around appearance, performance, and actions more than male idols. 

Is this known/broadcasted in Korea? Do they consider this sexism there? Are people aware of the double standards and ignore it? How are the idols dealing with this? 

And the choreography seems to be sexier or more steered towards focusing on their feminity. Specifically, not as harsh or sharp movements but flirty or swift.  As someone who has grown up in America, I find this very different from the American entertainment industry.

Has anyone tried to bring this into light or in conversation? In this progressive era, how are Korea and Korean society reaction towards such a topic?

""Well, maybe R&amp;B is all about soulfulness and voice's uniqueness after all"" I reason.

And then Wendy and D.O come to my mind. Knowing SM, they're known for their vocalist having a more healthier singing technique compared to, let's say, another Big 3 companies. Kinda hope SM will give them R&amp;B album from the start of their career. I dunno much about my reasoning in D.O but have you seen pre-debut Wendy covering Beyonc's Halo? Or her singing her audition song The Moon of Seoul? I do think she can pull off soulful singing without sounding so nasal and with actual more pleasant voice.

Though it's most likely will be a ballad album since Korea are such sucker to ballad songs and both have the ability to pull off ballads just fine, hehe. But a girl can dream, y'know~

Also, I kinda see Seulgi pulling another Taemin way. Not necessarily the same but y'know, with such vibe and all.",112,47

I'm curious what bits and bobs have stood out to you over the years.

I've recently been really enamoured with the [Apink](https://choicemusicla.com/products/%EC%97%90%EC%9D%B4%ED%95%91%ED%81%AC-apink-official-light-stick) and [Shinee](https://www.kpoptown.com/54441-large_default/shinee-official-light-stick.jpg) lightsticks. The Apink one is so whimsical, fits in their fandom, concept, and color and looks weirdly spooky when it's dark, the Shinee lightstick is so deceptively simple but the color is so unique and beautiful.

I also adore [every](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/smtown/images/9/9b/Redvelvetredroom.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170724115855). [single](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/52/74/00527409d84cd6a7f0eca0ed3f873339.jpg). [piece](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816yqEZNOBL._SY606_.jpg). of Red Velvet advertising and promo that gets put out. The artists and graphic designers obviously have a vision and it all feels so unique yet cohesive and just a real standout among standard album and concert promo. 

What is some of the best product/merch/or graphic design ya'll have seen? Let's celebrate some great design together!",38,53
2483,2019-4-16,2019,4,16,19,bdsaiw,A K-pop Tabletop Game! What would you want to see in it?,idlemichael,1555410257,"Hey folks! A bit of a different thread amongst all of the awesome stuff in this subreddit... and I was wondering if anyone out there has some input?

I'm a board game designer based in the UK who has a deep love of K-pop. At the moment, the company I work at is in the process of working out a load of concepts and getting them to what we call Proto Stage - in other words, making a very rough, very early version of a game to see if there's something potentially interesting there that we can develop further, potentially with a view to actually publishing it.

So, I figured why not mash the two things together and see what comes out? Now, I'm not talking BTS Monopoly (though I can pretty much guarantee that's in the works somewhere...) or a trivia game. I want to try my hand at making a game that sees players putting together a group, training the individual members up at singing, dancing and handling media, selecting songs and performing them at different shows. I see the players basically acting as managers of their own bands, making sure that their performers are happy and healthy, while also making them into the best band around.

This isn't going to be a licensed title; you wouldn't be able to mix up members of Red Velvet, TWICE and Girls Generation into a supergroup, for example - think of it more like plucking obscure but talented newbies from an audition, and building them up into the greatest group in the world.

As such, here are some questions - if this game were to exist, would you play it? What kind of things would you like to see in there? What kind of stuff would you expect to be able to do? What kind of art style would you want to see? 

Thank you in advance for your thoughts!",9,18

Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!",4,17

[And another one](https://youtu.be/W7f-6dVvw7I?t=980s)

She says ""and to really find ourselves within *those loves*"" as in they are not talking about a specific toxic relationship they wanna kill, but rather about a certain kind of relationships they want to kill and replace with other relationships. This connects with freedom of stereotypes and finding yourself in that love as in not making a shallow love of pretend (""in the end we lie, so what, so what"") but looking for a deeper one. She also says ""Its about killing toxic lovethat hurts us"" and not ""killing a toxic love"", so I think she really does talk about a type of love and not about a certain relationship.

By the way, when sites worded the interview, they changed that quote to: ""and to really find ourselves within [that] love."" as in, the one who worded this probably misunderstood what she said. Rose is fluent.

So yep I recommend going back and watching the MV since I saw it that way and it really made the song soo amazing to me. It's 5 or more times better with that meaning, to me.

I also just wanna say that when I commented my interpretation I got downvoted a ton, lol, so a tip to yall not to be too fast to cancel something that sounds odd to you",7,0

I recommend listening to their whole album and stanning them. I really enjoyed this song and was disappointed by how little views there were for such a bop!! If you're looking for something nice and fresh to listen to, I highly recommend this!

EXO doing Hi High could be interesting, since it's quite poppy and peppy akin to their later discography like Power and Tempo, with just a touch of cuteness. Chuuriah's high note would likely go to Chen, and it will be glorious.

On the other hand, Loona doing Mama would be... lol. The girls chanting 'Careless careless shoot anonymous' would be such a mood. I can't imagine anyone tackling the screamo bridge tbh - maybe Jinsoul and Olivia?

I noticed this kind of remarks already from their previous global auditions and it's actually irritating. i'm a girl too but if your legit dream is being an idol, big hit is not the only company out there. i know they make great music and production and they are indeed great motivators but ranting it out that you can't audition because of your gender makes it seem like you just want to audition to bighit so you can see bts and txt and other cool people there (which is really nice to think about). i have a lot of female friends that are serious in their creative work and they don't let their gender and sexuality be a hindrance to their dreams.",5,0

Idol's live seems really cool on the outside,but if you look closely,this is actually really really hard live. I wonder what makes people willingly get into this.

It's make sense if you are lucky to get into big company ,your hard work and sacrifices pays of.  Look at Taemin for example,he's achieved everything by the age when many people still have no idea what to do with their lives.  
But what makes people go into small agencies, go through abuse ,suffering,sacrifice their youth with no guarantee of debut or success? 

Dreams of fame(there's no guarantee)? Greedy parents? Genuine interest in music and desire to perform on stage( then why can't you just become a singer ?) Money(we all know how it works) 

There's people like Jonghyun who's life purpose was to be an artist,there's no other reasons why he became an idol .

But what about others ? Let's discuss.",18,1

Even at their strength, YT views, KTL looks to be quickly surpassed by BWL, just like DNA quickly left AIIYL in the dust back in 2017 and opposite to 2018 where DDDD outviewed both FL and Idol. Not to mention their status as future ""legends"" will become increasingly questioned when they have yet to win a daesang (and will most likely not win again), while groups like BTS, Exo and Twice all have won 10+. Some keep talking about Coachella but let's be honest, it's just a festival. They won't get any significant boost from it. Saying they are ""targeting the west"" is not a valid excuse, they would have to do much better to offset their korean underperformance.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it feels like they are at a crossroads, much more than after coming from that one year hiatus following AIIYL. The gap between BTS and them internationally has increased and they are still not known by western audiences to be relevant enough while they basically punted on trying to become the top GG in Korea despite their successful results in 2018, meanwhile Twice are coming and will keep cultivating their strong korean fanbase, while kblinks were left in the dust without even getting fansigns. It feels like they are in the same situation as the Wonder Girls when they went to America. WG left Korea, Korea forgot about them for SNSD and 2NE1, will they do the same to BP and look to new groups such as Itzy, whose debut single outcharted KTL and had 9 music show wins? Sure it looks possible if they keep going for that western pipe dream and especially if their next comeback takes close to a year to happen just like the last two (which would basically mean they could go over 18 months without a real korean comeback, since 3 music show performances barely counts as one), and my guess is YG is not pleased with their numbers in Korea, if it took them 10 months to return following a national hit, how long will it take after a flop? He could even ditch them for a new GG.",20,0

jonghyun really knew how to write for his own voice and his lyrics are nothing short of beautiful.  he was also just an amazingly talented vocalist.  i think pretty much all of shinee have grown to be very talented vocalists as well.",37,28

2752,2019-4-18,2019,4,18,13,behbyx,Anybody Else Worried About The Stream Culture?,Lamorosii,1555561162,"First of all, this is not a hate topic. I've had a few drinks and have just been legit thinking about this.  I'm a fan of K-Pop. Have been for roughly 7 years or so. I've liked many groups over the years, some have succeeded and some have faded away. I'm happy and sad for them in both senses. When it comes to the popularity of groups, social media has DEFINITELY taken a major play. Groups like BTS and BlackPink are EXPLODING because of it. But other smaller groups (opinion based, but groups like NEONPUNCH and LABOUM)  are super talented but don't have nearly the same kind of presence. One of the bigger platforms is obviously YouTube, being the main source of MVs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not trying to piss off anybody, but it's gonna happen. My main worry is the fact that fans feel the need to mass stream some groups. I REALLY like BTS and BlackPink, but I can't help but feel like doing this is going to be detrimental in the long run. I've seen pictures of fans with a dozen+ devices playing the videos over and over. Being an enthusiastic fan is one thing, but throwing artificial views is another. Being an ARMY and BLINK myself, I was thrilled that BlackPink and then BTS break a YouTube record, but to be honest, I knew that a good chunk of those streams were probably due to mass streamers.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's just me, but I just find it so unnecessary. These groups are fantastic. Always have been and always will be, but I feel like we should let them grow organically. Breaking records is nice, but not when they aren't naturally gaining new fans. Social media can be a complicated beast and spamming pics/videos/etc. is definitely a way to spread them, but I tend to find more haters then anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I've upset anyone. I legit want to have a conversation about this. It's bothered me for awhile. I posted once on the newest BTS video asking this question and they treated me like I was the biggest piece of shit on the planet. Should have known better, but It's a legit concern of mine. Anybody else feel the same way? I want to hear both sides. I know they exist here.",108,271

This is my first time posting here but I wanted to share my experience at the Blackpink concert at the Forum in LA. Ive been to a few other Kpop concerts and each has been a really fun and unique experience.

We got to the venue about an hour before the show started, and got into the merch line. They had several booths and PLENTY of merchandise to go around, which was nice because every other Kpop concert Ive been to has always sold out long before I ever had the chance to buy anything. We bought a lightstick and a couple of shirts and headed into the venue.

The crowd was pretty diverse. Id say it was about 60/40 in favor of female fans, and seemed like mostly twentysomethings, but I saw a lot of young kids and some older fans as well.

It was definitely not a full house. Even after the show was supposed to start, I saw plenty of empty seats. Id say it ended up being about 4/5 full. We were lucky to be in the first row of the balcony so we had an unobstructed view. Can confirm that the girls are even prettier in person (:

Then the show itself! I didnt take down an exact set list, and everything was such a blur that Ill never remember the exact order. Hopefully somebody else will post something a bit more thorough. They did perform all of their original songs (including Kiss and Make Up) and each girl had her own  solo stage. In general the concert followed the pattern of 3-4 songs punctuated with breaks for a video segment (including a Kia ad) or band performance. There were BIG cheers for Kill This Love, as well as Playing With Fire. I was particularly hyped for Forever Young, haha. The girls sang everything live! They used handheld mics the entire concertno headsets. Sometimes they had backing vocals and sometimes they didnt, but you could always hear their live voices very clearly. 

The overall production of the show was REALLY incredible. It was very flashythere were pyrotechnics, confetti, Co2, even fireworks. One thing that contributed a lot was the use of a live band. It gave the performance a bit of a rock concert vibe and really sent the whole thing over the top. More Kpop concerts should utilize live bands, IMO. 

They performed an encore where they repeated D4 and Stay. The concert ended promptly at 10, which meant that it clocked in at under 2 hours total since they started 10-15 minutes late.

Overall it was a great experience and an incredible show. My one gripe would be that it was on the short side. The girls gave a memorable performance and each one of their individual personalities really shone through on stage.

It was the kind of night you wish you could just bottle up and relive whenever you wanted! I hope everybody else who has tickets to their tour enjoys their experience, as much as I did (:",47,147

Id like to know whats that song youre listening to a lot thats not your faves title or promoted side track?  

For a recent example: Blackpink, you cant pick KTL or DKWTD  BP is hard because they only have like, four songs that they didnt perform on music shows :(


Ill start, EXOs a group with a lot of fantastic songs, but right now I can *not* get enough of [Trauma from Love Shot](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C3QfqCanL8c). The pre-chorus and chorus get me every time and its an absolute non-skip for me at the moment.

SO. Big news everyone heard was that NCT was to perform on Good Morning America, but that overshadowed their appearance on Strahan and Sara, the daytime talk show extension with a tiny studio audience. I didn't get GMA tickets but got tickets to S&amp;S through 1iota, and was ecstatic.

Check in time was 7:45am, but knowing kpop stans I took a Lyft to Times Square at 3am. I was only ~20th in line so all good!! Thankfully it didn't rain, and I made friends in line. About halfway through we found out they usually told S&amp;S liners to go away and come back 15 minutes before because GMA is the priority, but we reasoned with them and got them to recognize the fan managed line we set up across the street ... the power of older mature-sounding (hopefully) NCTzens amirite

Anyway we get in while they're doing their first live performance on the morning GMA, downstairs watching the broadcast, and the first thing we see when heading up is HOW SMALL the studio is. Like really! I knew it was one of if not THE smallest live audiences in talk TV, [but I was insanely close to the front](https://twitter.com/95LINE_twt/status/1118869787097096192) and so hyped off that. 

It's a 1.5 hour taping so really not difficult to stay pumped through it unlike other shows. Fast forward through all the regular segments, forced and not forced laughter (Keke Palmer and Carla Hall are honestly hilarious as hosts we stan) aaaaaand here we go NCT time.

They come in and everyone starts gasping at how good they look. Like you think they look good in 1080p? Try [5 feet away](https://twitter.com/95LINE_twt/status/1118911374992838657). Makeup on point, outfits on point, they're all shorter than I expected especially Taeil lol but Johnny is a giant, and they're just walking in and waving and going straight to Carla and Keke who make a joke about how they're living our dreams being one foot away from the boys.

Promo and performance time...I...I honestly have no words. Here's my tweet dump:

* No pic but Doyoung kept doing his half-uncomfortable, half-""are you seeing this shit""-but-yeah-I'm-excited smile

I'm still taking time to process this and am riding a concert high despite it being only 2 songs, Cherry Bomb and Superhuman. So will elaborate more probably later. But honestly guys, when your kpop group of choice comes to do local promos? Seize the fuckin day. *No ragrets*",11,186

I don't think her K-drama songs have been very good, the only one I liked was the one from Goblin. I'd love to see her go for a more Pop/Rock song like Mind Your Own Business. I miss that Ailee. 

Lee Hi. Now I love ""Breathe"" and ""Scarecrow"" but I'm not a fan of the Jazz songs she tends to sing. I'm probably in the minority but I wish she sang more ballads. I'd give anything to see her do a K-drama ballad. 

Solar (Mamamoo) needs to work with Jung Key like Wheein did because her solo stuff don't do justice to her voice. You can't have a hit based solely on voice, you also need a song with a sound that makes you addicted. Amber from FX has a great voice but her solo stuff leave much to be desired.",64,45

It made me realize that moments like that open a song are just so important to create excitement.

Other songs that either excite me or i just love to listen to include:
- Soyeons geudaeyeo in Seorita
- 2NE1s booming opening in I Am The Best is amazing
- Although plagiarized, the guitar in BBoom BBoom is so satisfying
- The whistle with no background music in Hann is so... magical (?)
- Opening to Hobgoblin... those b*tches knew what they were doing

##Charts and Achievements Poll

Our rules for charting, records, and achievements have evolved a lot over time in this subreddit. Despite our efforts to improve them, they continue to be a point of contention. As moderators, we even find the rules difficult to navigate. As much as we want everyone to participate in Town Halls, we recognize that the pressure for rule changes in those discussions might be coming from a vocal minority. We are not completely confident our rules reflect the wishes of our active users. For that reason we want to have a more accurate understanding of what the subreddit wants.

You can think of this poll as an a la carte menu. For each type of achievement, you choose what you want to see in our subreddit. If you want a refresher about the currently standing rules for achievements, please see the following:

* [The Charts &amp; Sales section of our /r/kpop Content rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_.2Fr.2Fkpop_content)
* [December 2018 Town Hall Follow-up 2: Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a5cti4/december_2018_town_hall_followup_2_electric/)

###Fill out the poll here: [poll.redditkpop.com/](http://poll.redditkpop.com/)

Poll instructions: The poll will ask you to authenticate with your Reddit account. We are checking that you have accounts that are greater than a year old. We are not logging what your actual Reddit account is. The poll is anonymous, filled with questions and optional answers in multiple choice format.

We plan to make an automated Charts &amp; Achievements post once per week where users can submit what they want to discuss as top-level comments. This will likely happen regardless of the results from this poll.

Like you don't want to just to like some of their songs but actually become a fan. Well I do. The most recent is NCT, specifically NCT 127. I first heard about them during their Firetruck era but with each release I notice from them (mostly from the Kpop Daebak playlist on Spotify) I just can't muster myself to say ""Hey, they seem to be a nice group. I'm really interested in them."" Their songs (and I guess their overall style) are just not my type. I actually did like NCT U's Boss and Baby Don't Stop (to my surprise) but they weren't enough to peak my interest and go through their catalog nor did I actually like it enough to play it on repeat. But then they recently came back on my radar with their collab with Lay and Jason Derulo for Shut Up and Dance and I absolutely like that song. Funnily enough, the most interesting part of that song for me is NCT 127 (maybe it's because of their dance?). I did hear Wakey Wakey before this but...I didn't really like it. But because of that collab, it really peaked my interest towards them and actually started going through their previous tracks. My mind was like ""there must me something that'll make me stan them"" but the closest is me liking Regular. I did listen to their Awaken album but I just find it okay. It's like I'm drawn to them in a way but can't find out why when looking for a reason. I guess I'm not really making any sense. Lol. But I'm still stuck in this weird illogical dilemma. I wonder if there are others experiencing the same scenario.",9,2
3069,2019-4-20,2019,4,20,21,bfbwtz,[ENG] Red Velvet Yeri's Solo Interview with Grazia Magazine,Rigby_k,1555765045,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cbuhdfhh2ft21...*

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Recently, you released a self-written song ""Dear Diary"" (To Twenty), it's a bit late, but congratulations!**

YERI: I think because I debuted at such young age, I got asked frequently ""what do you think will change the most when you turn 20?"" or ""what do you want to do when you turn 20?"" and at that time 20 was such an overwhelming concept to me, but once I became 20 nothing really changed. Rather, I think it was more of a time where I wasn't the best at comforting and looking back at myself. I wrote the song thinking about that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. The mood of the song was bright, but I liked the warm feeling of the way you were comforting yourself**.

YERI: There is a line where it says ""you don't have to pretty yourself, you don't always have to be anxious"" and I think while I wrote that part of the song I got comforted by it a lot. I was in the professional's world since I was young that I had no time to look back at myself, and I was not good at it either. But maybe it's because of the little free time I have now that Ive been telling myself ""good job, thank you,"" and that Im proud of myself more than usual. I poured those feelings into the lyrics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I didn't know your lyrics skills were this outstanding, I was a bit shocked**.

YERI: To be honest, there is more work of my own that I haven't shown to anyone. I naturally took liking into writing lyrics because I like reading a lot, then I started putting a melody together with the lyrics and it was very fun. I feel very happy when I pass time while I am focused on that work. I am excited myself about the future stories I will be creating. One day, I want to show you people an album where I have poured my stories into.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Red Velvet has definitely been expanding its ground yearly, do you feel it?**

YERI: It still doesnt feel real to me yet, but I do feel sometimes that ""our group has grown a lot"" and I felt it especially during the North America tour. Seeing everyone with different eye colour, hair colour, and even different language fill up the whole stadium made me feel a bit emotional. Whenever I experience something like that, I feel very proud and rewarded.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Let's talk about your North America tour. I heard you covered 7 places in USA and Canada with sold out tickets and the heat was insane.**

YERI: North America tour was such a dream to us. When we first heard the tour confirmation, we couldn't believe it. ""Can we really well carry out the stages throughout a whole month?"" half excited and half-worried, we couldn't sleep well. However, of course, because of our fans we were able to communicate together and have a lot of fun. Except two songs, we mostly sang in Korean, but everyone still sang along. It was such a thrilling and overwhelming experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. You guys have a lot of hit songs, but what's Yeri's ""one pick""?**

YERI: It has to be Rookie. Some might only remember the upbeat ""rookie rookie"" part, but to me it was special. Ever since the demo, I felt so energetic and motivated by this song. I think because of that special memory I am especially attached to the song. Even the performance suits me well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I feel that because Red Velvet has such power in their songs do you feel a lot of pressure every time you release a new song?**

YERI: It's definitely a lot of pressure. Because whenever there's a new song, the charting shows we definitely can't just not worry about it. However, we do realize that's not all, compared to the past the ""trust our fans and walk the path we want to walk"" has been in our mind a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. As you carry your celebrity career, are there any philosophies or phrase/ determination you live by?**

YERI: My mother always tells me, ""Fame always fluctuates up and down"" so I try to live being aware of that. If I only live chasing fame, in the future I don't think I would be able to get a hold of what to do next. If I live while aware of the reality, I think at least I wouldn't end up putting myself through stress and difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. What do you do in your free time?**

YERI: Whenever I have free time, there's always a pattern. Guitar lessons, write lyrics, work on songs, read books, or watch dramas &amp; movies, morning to night in my bed. I also like listening to old songs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I have realised you have very broad fan base. You are even picked as the warmest member to fans.**

YERI: I don't feel distance because of my age. My parents are on the younger side, and my mom and I are close just like friends, talking on the phone every day. She was very jealous of me being here today, she kept asking me what gift I was going to bring back for her (laugh). Anyways, for me especially unnies and oppas take care of me a lot. Rather than younger people, I think I fit better with older people; I even like and make good dad jokes! (Laugh)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I think it's great that you debuted at your 10s and achieved your dreams.**

YERI: I became a SM trainee in 5th grade, so I lived a very different life than people my age. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't hard. However, I think definitely, there were way more sense of achievement and worthy experiences, I gained. I was young and very competitive; I think the passion I learned at that time has contributed to my identity today. Even if I went back, I would have made the same decision.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Do you have any special goal for this year?**

YERI: First, being healthy! In addition, no matter how busy I am, consistently doing the things I like doing, like guitar and writing songs. I also want to exercise but it wasn't easy. I am on the weaker side where it's surprising that I have so much energy on stage. This year, I will build my endurance! Lastly, thank you to GRAZIA for giving me such a good time, I will never forget it! Love you!

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments. 

Monthly Items: Changed title format a little bit in hopes to lessen some of the confusion that I've been seeing the last few months.

Does anyone know why Bobby suddenly sold 8K copies of an album from 2017?

In the last 2 years KPOP has blown up in Europe and the USA with BTS and Blackpink leading the charge both being hugely successful and breaking record after record but I feel that their music and KPOP has changed.

Some of you would say that KPOP never had a unique identity because so much of it is derived from American music but I disagree. Yes, Kpop has been taking a lot from western music but at the same time it has been taking a lot from multitude of genres from all around the world, mixing them together and modernizing to create the KPOP music that we all love and enjoy.

In 2018 the KPOP sound changed. I can't explain but KPOP songs released in 2018 and 2019 sound and feel different from the ones in 2017 and before.

Though I can't pinpoint a song released in 2018 that is particularly guilty of this I can do it for songs released in 2019.

For the majority of the groups their Title Tracks still sound like KPOP but a lot of side tracks don't, like at all. BTS and BP are particularly guilty of this. 

The majority of both groups' recent albums sound nothing like KPOP and might as well have been sung by some western singers.

The songs that don't sound like KPOP are:

BTS- Make It Right, Jamais Vu, Mikrokosmos and Boy With Love

BP - Don't Know What To Do, Kick It and Hope Not

***TL;DR*** - When I first got into KPOP in 2016 I liked it because it sounded different, unique and had a lot of catchy music that I could listen to for weeks before getting sick of it, since 2018 and especially in 2019, songs have started to sound more and more like what you hear in western pop music and I don't like that.

Sadly, GD is still away on military enlistment, but VIPs will always be waiting for him. Hes the King, after all. 

However, it should be noted that since BTS is gaining a whole ton of popularity, a lot of newcomers know the members more. So its possible that Taehyung and Jungkook are gaining lot more popularity and traction than GD right now. That does beg the question about the difference between famous/iconic and popular/relevant, though. So would one say that V is more famous than GD right now because hes more relevant, or would it be more correct to say that GD is more famous because hes more iconic and historically impactful?",53,0

[Yeri for Grazia May 2019](https://i.redd.it/3h9pvptzoht21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Recently, you released a self-written song ""Dear Diary"" (To Twenty), it's a bit late, but congratulations!**

YERI: I think because I debuted at such young age, I got asked frequently ""what do you think will change the most when you turn 20?"" or ""what do you want to do when you turn 20?"" and at that time 20 was such an overwhelming concept to me, but once I became 20 nothing really changed. Rather, I think it was more of a time where I wasn't the best at comforting and looking back at myself. I wrote the song thinking about that.

**Q. The mood of the song was bright, but I liked the warm feeling of the way you were comforting yourself**.

YERI: There is a line where it says ""you don't have to pretty yourself, you don't always have to be anxious"" and I think while I wrote that part of the song I got comforted by it a lot. I was in the professional's world since I was young that I had no time to look back at myself, and I was not good at it either. But maybe it's because of the little free time I have now that Ive been telling myself ""good job, thank you,"" and that Im proud of myself more than usual. I poured those feelings into the lyrics.

**Q. I didn't know your lyrics skills were this outstanding, I was a bit shocked**.

YERI: To be honest, there is more work of my own that I haven't shown to anyone. I naturally took liking into writing lyrics because I like reading a lot, then I started putting a melody together with the lyrics and it was very fun. I feel very happy when I pass time while I am focused on that work. I am excited myself about the future stories I will be creating. One day, I want to show you people an album where I have poured my stories into.

**Q. Red Velvet has definitely been expanding its ground yearly, do you feel it?**

YERI: It still doesnt feel real to me yet, but I do feel sometimes that ""our group has grown a lot"" and I felt it especially during the North America tour. Seeing everyone with different eye colour, hair colour, and even different language fill up the whole stadium made me feel a bit emotional. Whenever I experience something like that, I feel very proud and rewarded.

**Q. Let's talk about your North America tour. I heard you covered 7 places in USA and Canada with sold out tickets and the heat was insane.**

YERI: North America tour was such a dream to us. When we first heard the tour confirmation, we couldn't believe it. ""Can we really well carry out the stages throughout a whole month?"" half excited and half-worried, we couldn't sleep well. However, of course, because of our fans we were able to communicate together and have a lot of fun. Except two songs, we mostly sang in Korean, but everyone still sang along. It was such a thrilling and overwhelming experience.

**Q. You guys have a lot of hit songs, but what's Yeri's ""one pick""?**

YERI: It has to be Rookie. Some might only remember the upbeat ""rookie rookie"" part, but to me it was special. Ever since the demo, I felt so energetic and motivated by this song. I think because of that special memory I am especially attached to the song. Even the performance suits me well.

**Q. I feel that because Red Velvet has such power in their songs do you feel a lot of pressure every time you release a new song?**

YERI: It's definitely a lot of pressure. Because whenever there's a new song, the charting shows we definitely can't just not worry about it. However, we do realize that's not all, compared to the past the ""trust our fans and walk the path we want to walk"" has been in our mind a lot.

**Q. As you carry your celebrity career, are there any philosophies or phrase/ determination you live by?**

YERI: My mother always tells me, ""Fame always fluctuates up and down"" so I try to live being aware of that. If I only live chasing fame, in the future I don't think I would be able to get a hold of what to do next. If I live while aware of the reality, I think at least I wouldn't end up putting myself through stress and difficulty.

**Q. What do you do in your free time?**

YERI: Whenever I have free time, there's always a pattern. Guitar lessons, write lyrics, work on songs, read books, or watch dramas &amp; movies, morning to night in my bed. I also like listening to old songs.

**Q. I have realised you have very broad fan base. You are even picked as the warmest member to fans.**

YERI: I don't feel distance because of my age. My parents are on the younger side, and my mom and I are close just like friends, talking on the phone every day. She was very jealous of me being here today, she kept asking me what gift I was going to bring back for her (laugh). Anyways, for me especially unnies and oppas take care of me a lot. Rather than younger people, I think I fit better with older people; I even like and make good dad jokes! (Laugh)

**Q. I think it's great that you debuted at your 10s and achieved your dreams.**

YERI: I became a SM trainee in 5th grade, so I lived a very different life than people my age. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't hard. However, I think definitely, there were way more sense of achievement and worthy experiences, I gained. I was young and very competitive; I think the passion I learned at that time has contributed to my identity today. Even if I went back, I would have made the same decision.

**Q. Do you have any special goal for this year?**

YERI: First, being healthy! In addition, no matter how busy I am, consistently doing the things I like doing, like guitar and writing songs. I also want to exercise but it wasn't easy. I am on the weaker side where it's surprising that I have so much energy on stage. This year, I will build my endurance! Lastly, thank you to GRAZIA for giving me such a good time, I will never forget it! Love you!

As you can see, I've changed the formatting a bit for the title of these roundups, to bring a little more attention to some of these projects (especially for our dear nugus) in case the solo Makestar threads get lost in the shuffle of the mass amount of news that grace our subreddit.

But here we go!

There's not anything really notable about the group outside of the standard idol stats, but they did most notably feature in a [CF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzlnYclsg3w) with Chungha for LG in February 2019 and were the only pre-debut group to perform at the most recent HEC KOREA Thailand concert.

Yongzoo is a singer/songwriter signed to Mostworks Entertainment.

Yongzoo has had a super interesting history leading up to his debut.

Initially, Yongzoo was most popularly known as an SM Rookie (credited as ""Yongsu""), having trained at SM from 2012-2014. 

After leaving SM, he auditioned (under the name ""Yongju"") on the Chinese/Korean music survival show *Super Idol* (on MBC) in 2016. Although his team won during the S1 finale and he ranked high enough to debut in the K/C-Pop group SWIN, it is assumed that political tensions between China and Korea at the time prevented him from debuting in the group, as he was not included in the official lineup when the group [debuted](https://aminoapps.com/c/k-pop/page/blog/get-to-know-swin/5gIV_ue2RgLeQMve2zB186rqGL3zNZ) in October 2016.

He then started releasing songs independently under the name Jhomie in 2017. Collaborating with producer FERDY, the duo released two singles together, with his first single being ""[ (see the light)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5uAUpzKH6c)"".

He would later sign to Mostworks in 2018, and officially debuted with the OST song ""  (In Your Eyes)"" featuring Yezi (of Fiestar) in May 2018 for the K-Drama *Are You Human?.*

Currently, he is most famously known for participating on the music competition show *The Fan*, which aired from November 2018 to January 2019. He would eventually place in the top 5 in the finale episode. You can check out his final performance (with Kwon Jinah) by clicking [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHl4hPDsIs)

This will be his first album and first non OST release.

&amp;#x200B;

[**NeonPunch Comeback Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_neonpunch_01/)

* Date Project Ends: May 22, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is NeonPunch?

NeonPunch is a five member girl group signed to A100 Entertainment. The label's first girl group, NeonPunch debuted in June 2018 with the song ""[Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQnm_qvTFNE)"". 

Prior to the group's debut, three of the members (Dayeon, Baekah, and Iaan) auditioned for YG's *MixNine,* though only Baekah (under her real name Kim Sua) made it past the auditions. Baekah did extremely well on her time on the show, ranking #22 before being eliminated.

Her most notable performance on MixNine was part of team My9 Me with the song ""[Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dH3GHgv5I8)"".

Soon after the group's debut, Terry decided to take a break for ""personal reasons"", eventually leaving the group in January 2019. She was replaced by Dohee in order to keep the five member lineup intact. 

The group's most recent comeback (and first with Dohee) was with the mini album *Watch Out* and accompanying single ""[TicToc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kYuagah3pk)"", which was released January 2019.

[**MASC New Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_masc_02/)

* Date Project Ends: May 30, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MASC?

Whoo boy, getting into the details about MASC is going to be...fun. 

So anyway, MASC is a four member boy group signed to Lotus Entertainment. The group debuted under JJ Holic Media (currently known as J Planet Entertainment), with the original lineup consisting of Woosoo, 26, ACE, and Heejae.

The group debuted in August 2016 with the mini album *Strange* and accompanying single [of the same name.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfmGJbqr0k) The group had one more single with the original lineup in 2017 (""Tina"") before J Planet announced the addition of four members to the lineup amidst [the Makestar project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_masc/summary) for their follow up single was running.

The additional members added to the lineup were Chibin, Doeun, Ireah, and Moonbong, and the group's first release as an eight member group was with the single ""[Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bfiYgnCQrw)"", which was released in October 2017. This would also be their most recent single until this project.

The group was on a de facto hiatus after that release until [news broke out](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207043wpp/mascs-ace-reveals-left-group-physically-assaulting-chibin-chibin-responds) in July 2018 that Chibin had been physically assaulted by ACE after Chibin had posted about the incident (which took place in March 2018) via his Instagram. After much back and forth via social media by Chibin and ACE, JJ Planet [released a statement](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207547wpp/mascs-agency-releases-official-statement-assault-incident-chibins-decision-leave-group) that ACE had been removed from the group after the incident (though ACE's [own statement](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207043wpp/mascs-ace-reveals-left-group-physically-assaulting-chibin-chibin-responds) stated that he left the group voluntarily) and that Chibin had decided to leave the group in June (a month prior to the news breaking out).

While Chibin's legal proceedings against ACE were [in the works](https://www.soompi.com/article/1209895wpp/mascs-chibin-takes-legal-action-ace-provides-additional-information-assault-incident) as of August 2018, nothing had been updated about it since.

26 would then [announce](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207583wpp/mascs-26-announces-departure-group-addresses-assault-incident-ace-chibin) his departure from the group shortly thereafter, wanting to pursue a career as a director (for film and television).

Douen quietly leave the group in October 2018, citing ""personal reasons"" as the reasons behind his departure.

The group's current lineup consists of Woosoo, Heejae, Ireah, and Moonbong.

Some more lighthearted information includes:

* The group's fandom name is MaBling
* Woosoo is friends with Block B's U-Kwon

3157,2019-4-21,2019,4,21,19,bfnixm,IN2IT () and Alexa (Formerly Alex Christine of Produce48) - IN2ITXION Tour in India Performance at Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi (190419),Cxrioxs,1555842885,"**IMPORTANT** I recorded all the videos myself so please share and subscribe to my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamUntilDark).

**Before the Concert**

- The **IN2ITXION Tour** in India was announced on [April 7th](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bablu7/in2it_is_touring_india_next_week/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and I immediately bought a ticket. (The seating plan for the Siri Fort Auditorium is pictured [here](https://imgur.com/a/jfiDxcx).)

- I would have to go by myself as even my friends who were KPop fans deemed IN2IT too nugu and thus, unworthy of their money and time. ****Dies inside**** NOTE: This was going to be my first KPop concert.

- The only IN2IT song I knew at the time was [Snapshot](https://youtu.be/v91KLr4R5Rw), and I had only come to know of them through [Weekly Idol](https://youtu.be/dHvr0y3IdFI) a few months ago. I would have to dive through their discography and learn their names and faces in the days leading up to the concert. I downloaded their three mini albums on Apple Music the same day.

- However, life got in the way and I only just managed to listen to a few of their songs ([Amazing](https://youtu.be/RwvtpZ2tfT8), [Sorry For My English](https://youtu.be/lNGGNKc_r_U)) and watch a basic [guide](https://youtu.be/_1Q6_OaFHaA) to the group on Thursday night (just one day before their concert!) so I was pretty much going with zero knowledge about the members because I only managed to successfully identify Isaac Voo by the end of the night.

**Day of the Concert**

- I arrived at the venue two hours early (because I was super paranoid about being late) and got my [ticket](https://imgur.com/a/IomjdL8). I was the first one to arrive! I had to wait for a long time in the park outside the auditorium for the gates to be opened.

- The staff set up a couple of [posters](https://imgur.com/a/IUNZYGE) in the lobby.

- I entered the hall at 7 PM. We got some free [goodies](https://imgur.com/a/8YKJKZX) including the Special KPop Edition of The Rolling Stone India magazine and a 3D hologram viewing plastic pyramid. The concert hall looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/WKPIDow).

- The Siri Fort Auditorium can hold up to 2,500 people, and unfortunately not a lot of tickets were sold. The hall looked pretty empty at first. I had bought an 800 ticket and I was at the back. However, the staff told us to move forward to fill the gaps, and I ended up coming forward to a [very](https://imgur.com/a/keo9BqH) nice view. As everybody gathered to the front, the hall started looking more [packed](https://youtu.be/75B7rhsUVjs). Around 800 people were present. The majority of the concert attendees were girls in their teens and twenties. Many parents accompanying their children were also present.

-  The concert started half an hour late. At 7:30 PM, the video of Alexas track [Strike It Up](https://youtu.be/j0w-mZBtIog) was played, and Alexa showed up a few minutes later to DEAFENING screams. The entire auditorium exploded with Alexa! Alexa! Alexa! She was definitely taken aback by the crazy cheering. Alexa was gorgeous and [hyped](https://youtu.be/W9PDysMptG8) up the audience successfully. She performed [Crazy](https://youtu.be/t3VXqCGw2Cs) by 4MINUTE, and [Say My Name](https://youtu.be/xJ17LfKKO4A) by ATEEZ. She was very charismatic and her performance was crazy energetic. Alexa had performed more tracks like BLACKPINKs [Ddu-Du Ddu-Du](https://youtu.be/NgGAInN6afU) at earlier concerts in Mumbai; so her set was presumably cut short due to the concert starting later than expected. She proceeded to [introduce](https://youtu.be/YYm-Foqjo_s) IN2IT.

- IN2ITs introductory video was played, and the members arrived one by one to absolutely EAR-SPLITTING cheers from the audience I could feel the  hall vibrating from the screams. The boys were so handsome, and I only recognised Isaac at first, but a tall blond guy immediately caught my attention (and I kept on looking at him the entire duration of the concert). He was Inpyo, and he became my IN2IT bias straight away. I gradually identified all the members till the end of the concert.

- IN2IT launched into a performance of [Paradise](https://youtu.be/VAjuxJb6eXs) as they arrived on stage.

- They performed [Rising Star](https://youtu.be/tykYWJJoFck) next.

- They [introduced](https://youtu.be/vvLj0NZUgGI) themselves individually to the audience, and they were astonished at the insanely loud cheering! Everybody screamed when they spoke Hindi, and the guys were genuinely happy to see us being so enthusiastic. They explained about the theme of the concert Coming of Age.

- They performed their debut song [Amazing](https://youtu.be/0uoyE3Qq7pU). Everyone stood up  from their seats and it was *so cool* to see them in their element on stage Their dancing was completely in sync and their vocals were very stable.

- [Be Bop Baby](https://youtu.be/RTi0Ae71q0k) was up next, and it was such a fun performance! 

- **Yeontae** performed an excellent rendition of [You Are My Everything](https://youtu.be/nxclhRgcerY) by Gummy from the soundtrack of Descendants of the Sun for the first of the solo stages. Everybody enjoyed this performance very much as the drama was also being played in the background.

- Next, **Isaac** danced to [Lullaby](https://youtu.be/4c419-UVpss) by GOT7. The cheers could probably be heard within a ten kilometres radius!

- They introduced the second section of the concert, [Party Time](https://youtu.be/TvDYTe2pb_A), and taught us the dance moves to Sorry for My English.

- They performed [Sorry for My English](https://youtu.be/dwj-knrgUvM) and everybody in the audience danced along! It was one of the best performances of the night.

- They [learnt](https://youtu.be/9T0yIw14M_g) some Hindi words from us and were pleasantly surprised to see that we already knew the Korean words that they tried to teach us! Isaac went down from the stage and spoke a bit to the lucky people in the front row.

- Next up, they performed [Its U](https://youtu.be/LJN4viRD_Xo).

- The hall EXPLODED with cheers when the first notes of [Idol](https://youtu.be/B77ZfZdWFQc) by BTS were heard! The boys did an amazing job with the dancing. They also performed a short cover of [Mic Drop](https://youtu.be/6QNGmx1a5_E) by BTS.

- One of my favourite performances of the night was of [Cadillac](https://youtu.be/447CtCKdCjc). I got so absorbed watching them that I didnt notice that my iPad wasnt on and missed a few minutes of recording the performance! 

- **Jiahn** sang [Theres Nothing Holdin Me Back](https://youtu.be/0rUqaoeQvS4) by Shawn Mendes for his solo stage.

- **Inpyo and Inho** delivered a beautiful performance of [Ill Never Love Again](https://youtu.be/Vm0WyioRqx4) by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper from the movie A Star Is Born.

- Hyunuk danced to [Love Shot](https://youtu.be/rVAq2bNhGQA) by EXO for the last solo stage and every single person in the audience lost their minds! This performance had one of the loudest cheers of the night.

- [Geronimo](https://youtu.be/bq6MIhq-rZA) was up next, and it was an amazing performance.

- A really smooth and elegant performance of [Starlight](https://youtu.be/hWOSkldxWNQ) by Unit Red of Boys24 was up next.

- They [asked](https://youtu.be/aAfpM4VzA0U) us to cheer for our favourite outfit of the night, the black suits they wore for the last set of the concert received the loudest cheers!

- The highlight of the night was definitely the joint IN2IT and AleXa stage. They performed a classic Bollywood song called [Bole Chudiyaan](https://youtu.be/IBvg3WeqP1U) from the movie *Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...* and this performance received a thunderous applause from both the kids and their parents! Alexa was dressed in a traditional green and pink *lehenga* and the boys wore black suits with golden *dupattas*. This [performance](https://youtu.be/7v1hLeFk2ZI) went viral many popular local websites released articles about it. ([The Times of India](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/k-pop-band-in2it-and-alexa-dance-to-bole-chudiyan-from-kabhi-khushi-kabhie-gham/amp_articleshow/68938729.cms), [Pinkvilla](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/video-hey-karan-johar-k-pop-band-in2it-and-alexa-dancing-bole-chudiyan-will-win-your-heart-447213%3famp), [India TV](https://www.indiatvnews.com/trending/news-korean-pop-group-in2it-and-alexa-s-dance-video-on-shah-rukh-khan-s-bole-chudiya-goes-viral-515144), [TimesNow News](https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/international-news/article/k-pop-meets-bollywood-korean-pop-group-in2it-dances-to-k3g-s-bole-chudiyan-video/401807), [BollywoodHungama](https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/kpop-group-in2it-and-rising-star-alexa-groove-to-the-beats-of-kabhi-khushi-khabhie-ghams-bole-chudiyan/))

- After that performance, they talked about their [favourite](https://youtu.be/-FhrcqtJwmA) Indian food and the places they wanted to visit. They really wanted to see the Taj Mahal, but unfortunately they were short on time so they wouldnt be able to go. Isaac also told us to sit down because he was so concerned that we might be tired! We were standing up pretty much the entire time.

- They delivered an excellent performance of [Snapshot](https://youtu.be/3sE4yrqJSoM), this was by far my favourite performance of the night.

- The music video of [Tomorrow](https://youtu.be/e6WfTj3EPgE) was played while the boys caught their breath backstage.

- The final song of the night was [2U](https://youtu.be/-xEQTuxpAJY). They must have said goodbye at least five times, but they had to come back again and again on stage  because we tried our best to not let them go by saying *Khajima!* every time! They were very touched by the loud cheering and Isaac nearly cried. They thanked all of us for coming, and especially thanked the [fans](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwY0UFmhLQe/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;igshid=1jfod1rv45od4) who showed up to welcome them at the airport despite the heavy rain that morning. They said that the Delhi concert was the best and they could really feel the crowds energy. Each of them also sincerely thanked us in Hindi.

**Post Concert**

- The concert finally ended at 10 PM. My ears were ringing, my voice was gone, my arms were aching from recording the performances all night, my legs were killing me as I was up on my feet for the entirety of the concert, and I was still so excited when I got home that I only got about three hours of sleep but IT WAS SO WORTH IT. 

- IN2IT posted [this](https://imgur.com/a/SNd6IMe) picture on their SNS after the concert ended. A few people snuck backstage and managed to talk to the members during this time, but I only found out about this later and couldnt meet them. :(

TLDR: The concert was 100/100. IN2IT and Alexa were amazing. Inpyos pictures dont do him even 1% of justice because he looks *ethereal* in real life. Isaac is precious and needs to be protected at all costs. Their performance was perfect and everybody who didnt go because IN2IT was too nugu seriously missed out.",6,63

But the thing is, theres so many other choices out there. Why arent there more collabs with artists in Asia. I like both C Pop and J Pop. Idols I know mention some Kpop idols as one of their role models. now I know that might not seem as much of a reason but I feel that nowadays we should mix things up. I mean we got Kangta and Vaness Wu didnt we? 

Here are some of mine (some of them dont seem realistic but I hope they will come true one day)

3263,2019-4-22,2019,4,22,15,bfysc2,"Fan Account: 2019 SF9 USA  Europe Live Tour ""UNLIMITED"" in New York 190421",torywestside,1555914149," 

First a bit of backstory: Ive been following SF9 since debut, theyre one of the only groups I can really say that for. I missed their Mamma Mia comeback, and for Now or Never and Enough only listened to the title tracks, which is almost a crime. They consistently have some of the most solid b-sides in kpop (fight me about it). So when I bought tickets to this I was (foolishly) hopeful that theyd do mostly older songs.

Anyway, on with the account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Show**

After the Chicago show on Friday I looked up the setlist. Most of the show was filled with b-sides from their last three albums which I listened to all weekend in preparation. I thought about not going/trying to sell my ticket, but I saw on Ticketmaster that the show wasnt sold out at all, and lots of tweets about the price of resale tickets dropping super low because of poor ticket sales (there were tickets on StubHub for $6) so I went to show my support! 

The show was at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, which is a truly gorgeous, 1920s-style venue. It also had free parking, which was a plus! It would be a great alternative NY venue for smaller groups doing tours (please go here instead of the Playstation Theater).  I didnt buy any merch or do any fan-engagements so I cant speak to how well those were run. 

There were two whole seated sections on either side of the theatre which were essentially empty, unfortunately. My seat was in the very back behind those sections, so I asked an usher if I could move into a seat further up and he said that was fine. I ended up pretty close to the front with a great view! I think most of the other people with seats in the back moved up as well, so hopefully from the stage the audience didnt look too empty.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Show**

The setlist on Twitter was definitely accurate, mostly the songs were from Sensuous and Narcissus. They did mix it up a bit, near the top of the show they did an 80s-themed mashup of Just On My Way and 4 Step from their first mini! That was very exciting for me, I hadnt seen anything on Twitter about it so it was a total surprise. 

There were quite a few unit/solo performances scattered throughout the concert, which were all really vocal/rap based and and let them slow things down between their high-energy choreo songs. Dawon, Youngbin, and Zuho did a performance of See You Again by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth that the whole crowd sang along to. Taeyang and Jaeyoon covered Justin Biebers Nothing Like Us and gave some super impressive vocals. Youngbin did double duty for a rap duet with Hwiyoung called Zeroff which we need a studio version of yesterday. Inseong wrapped things up with a solo stage of Bruno Mars Versace, and he killed it. Solos and units are always fun at kpop concerts and they did a really nice mix of songs! 

There was one VCR in the middle of the show featuring the members trying to complete various challenges (counting money while listening to music, reading picture books while being bothered by the other members, watching embarrassing videos/screamers and trying not to react) and then doing punishments. It was short, but cute. 

They ended the show with a second performance of Enough, but in English! Its been pretty popular for groups to do that recently, and from what I could hear it translated pretty well (yeppeojiji ma ya ya ya ya ya turned into dont get more pretty ya ya ya ya ya ya, so at least that was a pretty direct translation), hopefully well get an official release or at least a video of this! They also sang and danced around to New York State of Mind I hope someone makes a new, popular song about New York soon to replace that, haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boys**

SF9 what a charming group of boys, really.

I saw them at KCON NY in 2017 so I knew from that that most of them were at least a little comfortable speaking English, but they pretty much stuck to English exclusively for their ments, it was really impressive! There was no MC or translator, so Inseong (whos fluent) led the ments, asking/translating questions for the members and translating their responses to the audience if they needed. Dawon is also super confident speaking (and so funny in any language), he chatted to the audience solo for a bit before starting his unit stage. They all joked around a lot, Jaeyoon said he wished he could live in a tree in Central Park and they all made fun of Hwiyoung for pretty much everything. 

During one of the ments Inseong said that some of the members had prepared things to share with the audience. The first one was the \[triangle dance\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DB-PEEywc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DB-PEEywc0)), which a lot of the audience (including me) didnt seem to be familiar with, apparently its a meme on TikTok? Chani, Youngbin, and Jaeyoon demonstrated, and when they asked for music to go with it Baby Shark started playing, so they gave up on doing the triangle dance at that point and the whole group did Baby Shark for a bit. The other prepared things were a lot less strange; Hwiyoung covered part of a Hopsin song, and Jaeyoon, Chani, and Taeyang did the Baseline Challenge. 

The whole group was very generous with their audience interactions, when fans in the front row would hold up their phones to take videos a lot of them (especially Hwiyoung and Inseong) would throw finger hearts/blow kisses/sing for their cameras. Taeyang took a lightboard of his name from one Fantasy and held it up for a while, and a couple of them took flowers from fans as well. Someone threw a stuffed pokeball at the stage and it hit Taeyang, I think they were a little less amused by that than the other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely way too long already so Ill end it here. This is only the beginning of SF9s USA and Europe tour, if theyre coming to perform near you please, please, please consider checking them out! They put on a fantastic show and they dont deserve to perform to empty seats. I know there are very cheap tickets to their other USA shows on StubHub, so please support these fantastic boys. I'm really glad I decided to go, and I hope they're able to come back for another tour!",17,31

Did one win you over more than the other ?,bassoontennis,1555922585,"I ask this question  because my Mum has been subjected to both albums as well as k-pop in general (for the last 8 months in our weekly car rides) and is a fan of BLACKPINKS album over BTS. Here are our thoughts. 

BTS:
 (Mum) She was not a fan of the first track she said after being subjected to my 100+ song playlist this was the first song she couldnt enjoy. She is not a rap fan at all. She enjoyed Boy with Luv and Make it Right. 

(Me) Huge fan of RMs Intro: Persona, I play it when 
my mum is not around. I also was a fan of Boy with Love and Make it Right. Ive also had Dionysus on repeat for the last few days, love the rock vibe on the song. I literally talked about their SNL debut to my Mum that whole week. I really enjoyed their
SNL debut and cant wait for their return to the BBMAs. 

BLACKPINK: 
(Mum) She enjoyed all the songs on this album, and I even found her singing along to Kill this Love and the Remix. She enjoyed the pace of the album fast, slow, fast, slow, fast. 

(Me) Ive played the whole album every day at least once sometimes twice while I drive and my Mum isnt there. I fell in love with Dont Know What To Do and Hope Not. I also tested the limits of my cars speaker system with the Remix, I have thoroughly enjoyed blasting that song. Even though I LOVE dancing In the car to their songs, Ive probably played Hope Not more than any of the dancing songs. Also MASSIVE shout out to Lisa, had no idea she could sing. 

Overall both me and my mum enjoyed BLACKPINKS album more than BTSs. However, I cant stress how much I enjoyed BTSs album overall I felt all the guys really got to show their stuff. Both albums have been added into my k-pop shuffle.",14,0

(week 41),ThisGuyKpops,1555948508," Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",14,23

I followed Twice in the SIXTEEN days and was so excited to witness a group that was going to pull off this sexy confident vibe that kept being presented to us during the show. And then... and then they debuted and they were pretty good. Then TT came which was a classic. But then...? They just devolved into a cutesy group, where every song has the same superficial lovey-dovey meaning and the same cheery melodies. Which is fine, people obviously like it, but it's not my style.

Then the Fancy teasers came out and I was like . What is this??? Is this the Twice I've been waiting for???

It seemed as if they were finally going down a more mature path - they even stated that this would be a big concept change. I was ecstatic!

And now, Fancy is finally released, and........

It's literally the same as every other song other than the synths in the beginning and the cool MV. ""Sweet chocolate icecream melting, I love you, I fancy you~ ""

I'm so disappointed. I was expecting Fancy to be a song about how fancy these girls are, with a bit of ego, kind of like how CLC's No is all about feeling confident. Instead, we got the same submissive girl crush song.

I am still waiting for the day that Twice shows off those badass SIXTEEN roots... I know they can do it!

Was anyone else expecting more from this comeback?",15,0

Hi there! So, its been a hot minute, but Im *finally* back with the results for Round Two of The B-Side Wars and with Round Three. Im sorry for the life, some personal issues delayed the results, but, well, theyre finally here.

Round Three will include various groups (just like Round Two did), but this time youll have only three songs in said group, and youll have to choose *only* one song. Out of the three songs included, the least voted song will get eliminated. I hope thats clear enough, if not, itll probably make more sense once you actually see the form. There should be a playlist included for each group and, well, thats all I have to say regarding Round Three. Round Four might be duels, however, I am not quite sure of that yet. Either way, were getting a lot closer to the endgame now.

Now, onto the Round Two results, Ill break them down by groups, most voted to least voted. The eliminated songs (the least three voted songs) from each group will be bolded, just to make it clearer. There might also be some personal comments on a few groups, please dont mind that. Some songs that I absolutely love sadly got eliminated, but, well, there isnt much I can do about it. At the end of this, therell be a breakdown of all the songs, with the top three most voted overall and the top three least voted overall, etc.

o Red Velvet  Butterflies (95 votes)

o Loona Odd Eye Circle  Odd Front (83 votes)

o Loona  Rosy (63 votes)

o **Mamamoo  Words Dont Come Easy (56 votes)**

o **SNSD  Animal (56 votes)**

o **SNSD  Reflection (47 votes)**

Why am I not surprised that Body Talk and Butterflies got the same amount of votes. Had Rosy been eliminated, I wouldve been quite angry, oh boy.

Hey everyone! I'm an artist who is trying to improve their writing skills. To practice, I'm thinking about writing an alternate universe of kpop with different agencies, and a few other altered things. Is there anything specific you, as a kpop fan, might enjoy reading about in an alternate universe of kpop? 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't fleshed out the plot quite yet, but I'm thinking of having a co-ed group as the main with a fresh, RnB concept from a large company. I was planning on having the underrated member getting to know their songwriter/composer/arranger/other co-worker and forming a romance, maybe? I'm not good at writing romance, though, so it's going to be a challenge for me. Are there any tips you would give to a new writer for writing romance?

Twice : Momo, the way she moves her body when dancing...damn lol. Although, I think Jihyo is really close behind her.
(G)I-dle : I think we can all agree that Soyeon just oozes charisma.
Hyuna - We all know she's not the greatest vocalist nor dancer, but nobody commands the stage like her.

So NCT announced literally yesterday that if you pre-order the new album at Rough Trade, you will be able to meet and take a photo with the group. So of course I jumped on the opportunity cuz who gets to even imagine meeting an SM group. 


So I arrived around 3:30 pm to the store and the meet doesn't start untill ""6pm"". So 30 mins later, they start organizing the line into two by last names, A-M and N-Z. This was to get wrist bands. Let me tell y'all, it was POURING out here. Me and my friend didn't bring an umbrella so we were basically dying and soaked.


So we slowly make it in to get our wrist bands. So after you get your hands, you gotta get into another line for the photo. There was one formed inside and it was basically the people who were getting it first. The rest were to go back outside in the rain to wait in the second line. One of my other friends was fortunate enough to be in the first line so we joined her. Thank God cuz it was fucking cold as balls out there.


So a little later, we heard people screaming from outside. Their tour bus pulled up and they got out to enter the building. We inside haven't seen them yet at this point.


6pm-ish starts rolling around and the boys finally come out and sit in front of an Super Human backdrop. Basically they were just out in the open and we could literally watch them take pictures with everyone it was so surreal I almost passed out. 

So when we go to the front of the line, they took our wrist bands just to prevent people from going a second time. They told us to drop our stuff quick and basically the boys were watch me flip my shit and almost trip in front of them. 


So here's the order, top row is Johnny, Mark, Yuta, Jungwoo and Dooyoung. On the bottom row is Haechan, Jaehyun, Taeyong, and Taeil (I miss win-win...). So my biases are Mark and Johnny so they happened to be sitting next to each other. So for this basically you can sit in front of them, stand behind them or to the side of them. So I stood behind Johnny and Mark. I WAS LITERALLY SO CLOSE TO THEM I TOUCHED THEIR SHOLDERS SLIGHTLY. I asked Mark if I could make a heart with him and he was about to make one but he then remembered and said ""oh I'm sorry I don't think we are allowed to do that :("" in the softest and sweetest voice :((((. I was trying to say something to Johnny but I don't think he heard me. Then the lady told us to move more to the left so I then ended up between Mark and Yuta. 


So we take like a couple of shots. As we are leaving, I wanted to say bye to Johnny but I got so shook by his smile that I chickened out. Instead as I was trying to wave to him, I ended up making eye contact with Jaehyun in the front and he waved goodbye to me with the sweetest smile &lt;3. I noticed that he took the time to say bye to everyone. He really is so stunning. 


They gave us a poster and a link we could go to to check out our pictures when they are ready.


So that's it! I cried reallyyyy bad after because Mark is so important to me and I was so glad I was able to talk to and stand next to him. &lt;3

...so if you haven't had an eye on the NCTzen community lately, you probably wouldn't have known about this event. It was very last minute, very low-key, and very... controversial lol? At least for a subset of kfans.

Why? Because while many fans and fansites will spend hundreds to *thousands* on albums to get to a SM fansign in Korea, their US label Capitol Records just offered NYC NCTzens a guaranteed ticket ***for a single $18 preorder***. Fuckin insane.

The event was announced Sunday night around 10pm by [**Rough Trade Records, a vinyl/record store in Brooklyn**](https://twitter.com/RoughTradeNYC/status/1120145194316263424), and sold out in minutes even though NCTzens at first were struggling to understand if this was legit. I mean, we were sitting at a Shake Shack downtown, it was creepy as fuck, was all this some kind of Twilight Zone mindgame? But no, I ordered and NCT themselves retweeted the event info, and holy crap I was going to see NCT in person a third time before their concert dates even began lmao what the hell Capitol/SM.

My groupchat and I all finessed our way out of work 4:30 to get in line for wristband pickup by 5 (apparently they really enforced the official line not starting until 4, because some people were paranoid and lining up since 11pm the night before...and the announcement was past 10pm). Then we're herded back out to wait in the rain which was pretty miserable especially because some of the girls around us had pretty deep I'm-in-high-school-and-hate-the-world-except-for-Taeyong vibes

Fast forward to the photo sesh...and through the photo sesh lmao. I was NOT expecting a full on fansign or fanmeet with how many people it seemed they let preorder, but it was still a great short moment. They lined us up either standing behind them or kneeling in front, and they let us have a few seconds to converse while setting up the shot, then immediately and quite literally shoved us out with a poster and photo URL right afterward.

No, I didn't get to let Yuta sign my photocard or Doyoung my mini Regulate vinyl, but I feel like [**Taeyong noticed me freaking out a bit and freezing up and went out of his way to make that connection**](https://twitter.com/95LINE_twt/status/1120508720167968769). part 2 again [**of taeyong being a fanservice king**](https://twitter.com/95LINE_twt/status/1120472161335021572). also [**Taeyong is so pretty wtf he's like a male Hani**](https://twitter.com/95LINE_twt/status/1120473416329506817). someone help me the poor yuta stan who keeps getting mentally hipchecked by this kid's best friend

but safe to say I'm done for now until the concert. Honestly not to brag but we've been hit left and right with [**""oh NCT's handing out Easter Eggs at Times Square""**](https://twitter.com/AKA_Kristien/status/1120016860710359041) or [**""oh NCT's at that one Trader Joe's""**](https://twitter.com/sabrinaT1989/status/1120069912771403781) etc etc.

Somebody please take me back to 2013 and throw SNSD in the arms of Capitol Records because they are doing a fantastic job of parading NCT around all the NYC media circles, print/digital, broadcast, radio, social, you name it. My managers were talking about them and all they usually follow is RHONY. I aint a shill but bravo you somehow made some international kpop fans TIRED of hearing about their boys

goodnight /r/kpop you'll hear from me again after newark and/or chicago

The Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center will honor hip-hop and R&amp;B artist Jay Park and jazz band Hiroshima at its inaugural celebration, The Party, the center announced Monday (April 22).

&amp;#x200B;

Park will be awarded the Game Changer Award for his work as an artist, songwriter, choreographer and entrepreneur. Grammy-nominated band Hiroshima will be honored at the event with the Legend Award in Music. In addition to music, the center will also recognize contributions in other categories including sports and culinary arts.

&amp;#x200B;

The Party will celebrate the indelible contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to the American experience, said Lisa Sasaki, the director of the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center. From music to technology, sports to entertainment, these modern history makers inspire Americans of every ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic background by demolishing barriers and challenging timeworn stereotypes with their talents, perseverance, and ingenuity.

As part of the celebration, the event will also launch the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Keystone Initiative and help fundraise for the first permanent Asian Pacific American Gallery within the Smithsonian.

**Fortunately**, there's still a whole 'nother **8 DAYS** before your versions of NA NA NA NAVILLERA are due, and now you have the assistance of the amazing **OFFICIAL PRONUNCIATION GUIDE**, so get recording!!!

#[Click here for submission guidelines!](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bbbzfy/rkpop_sings_spring_single_results_submissions_now/)

#Pronunciation Guide

As we know from the survey, not a ton of us are Korean experts (omo~ ). The wonderful native speaker /u/jellyfilled_donut took the time to put together a pronunciation guide for us (over her vacation!!) Please give her tons of love, we would all sound a lot stupider without her guidance.

Here are jelly's guides to the vowel sounds, and below is her guide to Navillera itself (with some slight adjustments to rhythm by me), romanized with emphasized syllables bolded. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Navillera isn't really a word in...*any* language, so let's all go ahead and pronounce it the way GFriend do. They pronounce the L's but ALSO keep the Y that a double L would usually imply in a Latin-based language, so it's basically: **nabiL-LYERa**. Obviously v--&gt;b is a common Korean pronunciation, but it's overall super counter-intuitive to anyone who would instinctively look at that word and say ""naviyera"". So...good luck!

A FEW QUICK NOTES:

* Despite being a fairly hard song vocally, Navillera is actually really simple rhythmically and lyrically as the pre-chorus and chorus are all pretty precisely on beat, which is why so many of these lines are just solidly bold.

* Don't forget to smile while you record! I promise it'll help you sound more ~powerfully innocent~

* /u/hi_im_trash_xd suggested an excellent way to break up your recordings by member on the previous thread: 
&gt; sing this in 3 takes (plus redos) seems to be Eunha+Yerin, SinB+Sowon, Yuju+Umji as I believe this leaves exactly 0 points where you have to sing twice in a row.

I haven't tested this, but it looks close enough to warrant inclusion! Thanks /u/hi_im_trash_xd!

As always, thanks to the mods, the team, the community, and a special shout out to those of you who have already submitted! We think this one's going to be pretty special ",2,52

Submissions will last a week, you can find the form [here] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDn49qBM5UhEgCkLHSX75e4CvwJ_HpHBZUyM9quGCqmUAN5g/viewform) and if there are any problems with it, please let me know.

My priority will be finishing TBSW, but I'll work on this as well. However, the results might take a little bit more than TBSW' results, but I kind of made a disclaimer for that. Until I finish TBSW, the results for TTW should take two weeks, or three at most. Once I finish TBSW, the results for TTW should be done quicker.

I'll try to focus more on the community's opinion in this tournament, and if you have any suggestions or want to make any reasonable changes, please let me know. This should be a smoother (albeit longer, but smoother) experience than TBSW, and I'll try to not make nearly as many mistakes with this tournament. I'll try to redeem myself, more or less.

If you have any questions, suggestions, anything, please, *please* let me know.

Until then, please vote and make sure to think twice!",2,1

Ex-**Dalshabet**'s member **Subin a.k.a Dalsoobin**'s instagram game has been on point recently and came across to this account **@2nd.life.nikita** ([www.instagram.com/2nd.life.nikita](https://www.instagram.com/2nd.life.nikita)). Both of them are posting pictures together on each other's instagram accounts and addressing them as their **BFF** (Best Friends Forever).

Tbh, Nikita seems like Subin's **alter ego** / **doppelgnger** / **twin.**

Nikita's motto is 'Live for the moment' and she seems like she is confident with her strong and provocative styling.

Since Subin has been restricted with her so called 'Kpop idol image', Nikita is indirectly unleashing Subin's inner side.

The boy/girl bands originating from South Korea are actually alien clones used to attract the humans' attention to divert it from the aliens' original plan, to use the earth for their own likes. As the attraction to Korean boy/girlbands rise, so does the awareness of the world against abnormal situations decrease. Some of these alien clones are actually elite squads of clones, such as BTS, Blackpink, Seventeen, etc. with the majority of the rest being secondary forces to attract non-fans into becoming fans and/or potential slaves. Some theory leads to Jennie being the leader of these clones, with her top tactic, the song ""Solo"" captivating both fans and non-fans, stealing the attention of the world. As such, these bands hold events like concerts, a technique used to distract law enforcements to increase security in the areas of concerts, thus giving the aliens' agents time to collect data, do a survey, do some espionage, and/or kidnap humans temporarily for experimental  purposes. Once the bands/clones have captivated the majority of the world's population, the entirety of the army (clone bands) will hold an enormous concert, featuring all of them, in the most militarily advanced country in the world (America ofc.) or divide their amounts equally so that military forces/security forces are forced to focus on the security of the location of the events, as they are very large. Once the military and/or the security forces are distracted, the aliens' military will strike, whilst the world isn't ready to face it, thus wreakinh havoc and conquering earth. The possibility of humans surviving or even trying to rebel can be described as ""small as microbes are to elephants"", as the world's military has already been destroyed. It is only a matter of time before the world yields before K-Pop bands/clones, therefore yielding to the aliens, hence the timely demise of the human race.",3,0

But I didn't really connect with Got7 other songs. 

This also happened to me with Bang Yongguk and B.A.P, his new album is a masterpiece in my opinion while I like only some of B.A.P songs. It makes me wonder if I missed some really great units/solos because I didn't like the groups.

Do you find yourself really excited to hear music from a subunit or a solo artist but also kind of being indifferent to their main group?

It seems I am not alone about Kill this love as plenty of people criticized the song, with BTS it seems as if 90% of the hater' comments were about Halsey and not about the melody or MV. Even other recent songs: Jakcson's one, the 2 from Hyomin and Gogobebe (Mamamoo), Senorita (G-IDLE) I don't think they're hits or anything. Again, I am not saying these songs suck, I get the artists worked hard for them and the MVs are nice but it's just not ""breathe taking"" or anything special.  

So if anything who can fix this? Hyuna, something new from GD, Lisa's solo MV?

KPOP is no stranger to foreign born KPOP singers: Henry, Ailee, Jieqiong, Yukika, Jackson, Tzuyu, and list goes on and on.

However, when you look of at the singers from other Asian countries, more specifically Southern Eastern Asian countries, such as Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, etc; there tends to be few or no one from their countries. The only SEA country that has a lot people in KPOP is Thailand with Ten, Bambam, Minnie, Sorn and others.

I'm ethnically Vietnamese, and I once taught an English class to students, of which at least 50% were fans of KPOP, so KPOP is definitely welcomed by the newer generation here.

There's Isaac Voo in IN2IT, Kriesha Chu, and two Singaporeans were in the now disbanded SKarf. What about Cambodia? What about Laos? Brunei among others? What is it about these countries that causes a lack people from joining or from trying to join KPOP? Is no one from these countries trying to do a video audition if they can't go to the live audition? Are live auditions the problem here? I really want to know because it's not really bugging me, but it's a question that I've always held on to.",16,19

Kill This Love or Fancy You,GGirlGem,1556162292,"I have the chance to buy one recent album from a girl group (this is not the set up to a joke). I'm debating between Kill This Love and Fancy You. I can technically buy both, but that would break my bank account... Or neither but then I would be sad lol
I stan a lot of less popular girl groups, but none of them have made recent comebacks. (DC, Loona, EVERGLOW (already ordered it), Iz*one (have heartiz), ITZY, Oh My Girl, etc.) 

I want KTL because I don't have any BLACKPINK albums or photocards. Also imo, I think this album has better content (music, photocards etc.) than their other albums. Also, those stickers! The thing is I won't get any preorder bonuses so should I just buy it later?

I want Fancy You (I have summer nights) because the preorder photocards are the bomb! Also, it looks pretty cool. It has a lenticula and stickers. I want to wait for a better TWICE album though (the you stickers are too much imo) 
Should I just find a TWICE official pre-order cards online (C version is hella cool)?",4,0

Both of them are posting pictures together on each other's instagram accounts and addressing them as their **BFF** (Best Friends Forever).

Tbh, Nikita seems like Subin's **alter ego** / **doppelgnger** / **twin.**

Nikita's motto is 'Live for the moment' and she seems like she is confident with her strong and provocative styling.

Since Subin has been restricted with her so called 'Kpop idol image', Nikita is indirectly unleashing Subin's inner side.

3913,2019-4-26,2019,4,26,23,bhmwa6,Red Velvet I feel deserve better,Trollinaintezy,1556288838," Red Velvet literally has one of the generations best visuals(irene), one of the generations best vocals(Wendy), one of the generations best dancers(seulgi), a multi-talented much improved actor(joy) who was a main lead in what was voted to be one of the top 20 K-dramas of 2018, and a social butterfly(Yeri) who is impossible to love once you see her talk. All of their greatness is being overshadowed by their lack of stage presence. Stage presence makes or breaks groups, which is why groups like twice and blackpink are more popular than the more talented Red Velvet, even though Blackpink's stage presence is being carried by Lisa. I really hope that Red Velvet's comeback this summer contains eye popping choreo that will help them to light up the stage. I honestly usually don't really care about how popular a group is but in the case of Red Velvet I definitely feel like they should be more popular than they are and feel like their talent should be taking them way higher than it currently is. Also SM needs to actually give a shit about promoting their groups well.",3,0

I've been looking to start a kpop group comprising of 7 members (myself included) as a semi project/experiement/fun.

I haven't had too much luck in recruiting/finding people who are interested at this stage - I'm not too sure where to try.

I also live in Perth, Australia

I have a few examples

Loona - Sonatine (the tango/accordion sound is so different and pleasing to listen to, if anyone knows kpop songs like this then pls lmk!) 

Gfriend - Time for the moon night (when Yerin and SinB sing bureul kyeojwo simjangi kkamkkamhae, they sing it in a certain way, theres a lot of pauses and they drag out the last word) 

Blackpink - See U Later &amp; Kill this Love (I love every part of see u later EXCEPT for the chorus, its so drastically different from the whole mood of the song that it sounds really odd. As for kill this love, I really enjoy roses parts. The chorus wasnt as shocking as see u laters one but I wouldnt say it sounds as good as roses section of the song. 

I get into a dilemma on whether I want to put up with the song just so I can hear the parts I like. Im curious about what songs other ppl have this problem with",128,127

I first got into kpop around 2012, which I must say was probably the golden age of kpop for me personally. So many amazing groups came out during that time period. To get back to my original question though, the first few songs that got me into kpop were CNBLUE-I'm a Loner (Because I remember seeing Yonghwa on the drama Heartstrings and it led me to search him up. Haha who would've known this would spiral me into the deep end of kpop), Vixx-On and On, and Nu'est-Face!! What were the first songs that got you into kpop? :)",195,30

&amp;#x200B;

What dances seem to work great with the number of members available, or in other words what choreos don't look the same when a member is missing?

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite example (so far) is [Knock Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idOQFSu_4Ok) by Twice. I love the beginning where they're all 'vibrating' and reveal members and then later when they continuously break into groups of three. It's an adorable dance and I can see only 9 members do it, no more, no less. There was a [duo on Produce 48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v83Bc1_Og0) that covered the song and unfortunately, they didn't do it justice.",83,122

I heard this one song on the kpop channel on t.v (yes there is one) and it was if I remember correctly looking back on memories after a devastating break up. It was a female singing. And the music video and the song was beautiful. I did shed some tears at the end .

The only thing is i dont know the artist or the title of the song and since I dont know korean i cant search it up either.

4142,2019-4-29,2019,4,29,2,bidf00,Fan Account: BLACKPINK in Hamilton 190427 (BLACKPINK in your GTArea),somericecake,1556471211,"So um, [hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5mDVOihs4) again everyone. This is the 4th installment of my 2019 k-pop concert series and what a night this was. My throat is currently sore and I regret yelling so much, but at the same time I really don't.

So preface, I was initially skeptical about going to the concert because of the lack of songs, but in the end I caved because of the new comeback which pushed me just enough to think that it would be worth it. Since ticketmaster's resale prices were cancer, I checked out stubhub/seatgeek for the first time and found a pair of tickets, which normally would've been worth 300+ each, for only $140 each. Now that's more like it. :) 

Right as we sat down, they were playing all the MVs which everyone sang their hearts out for. The concert was supposed to start at 8, so pretty much every MV after 8 was given a huge UGH until they cranked up the volume hard on DDU-DU DDU-DU indicating that were about to go off. Band goes hard and BP emerges. First song? **DDU-DU DDU-DU**. Well ain't that a coincidence. Of course they start with the hardest song that makes the crowd get absolutely hyped including myself. They all look hella good (of course). Ends with smoke and pyrotechnics. OH YEAH. Then they proceed with Forever Young which was crazy as well. Jennie went HARD on her raps (and did so the entire night, so no laziness concerns y'all). At one point, all their platforms were supposed to rise up, but for some reason Lisa's didn't so she was just going hard on floor level. After a brief intro (including a longer introduction to the tour by a tired Jennie), we went into **Stay** which was very nice to hear live. After that was **Whistle** which was killer. Jennie's rap game is on point. The music played Jennie's first line from the rap, but then goes full instrumental with Jennie spitting hot fire. I honestly forgot how dope this song is. After this was the first intermission to which my friend and I both took a second to look at each other like ""DAMN"". 

The next section was basically everyone's solo performances. First up with little miss Rose with **Let It Be + You &amp; I + Only Look At Me**. Beautiful covers with Rose tearing up at one point as part of her emotional connection. Next up was bad girl Lisa with **Take Me + SWALLA LA LA** and HOLY FUCKING SHIT. Just wow can she dance and lay it out. If you hear the fancams on my phone, I'm basically being the hypeman for Lisa and Lisa alone because I was so pumped for this performance and she delivered. My video of Swalla is so shaky because of how shook I was. It was that intense. Next up was the lovely Jisoo with **Clarity** which was not a song I expected to hear her sing, but it was beautifully done and I could tell she was having fun with it. Every time the drop came, she just jammed along on her mountain of pearls or on the extended stage. Lastly of course is Jennie's **Solo**. Bitch. Jennie's So. Lo. Amped as hell from the last few performances and this one did not disappoint either. Onto the next intermission. 

They come back and it's **Kill This Love**. ANOTHER AMP-UP. Fire evrywhere and trumpets galore. This song ruled. After that was **Don't Know What To Do** which was wonderful too. The aesthetics of the screens and stuff were beautiful. Afterwards, they spoke briefly again with Rose mentioning how the emotion she had during her solo draws from the crowd and so she got real into it because of how passionate we all were. Insert stuff about first concert in Canada and stuff. Everyone was having a ball so far. They then transitioned to what they siad was one of their favourite songs which ended up being **Kiss and Make Up**. I forgot who covered Dua Lipa's part, but they did it very well and the crowd was really into this one. Afterwards the band merged onto the main stage for the next two songs which were **Really** + **See U Later**. Fully jamming to both songs, I LOVE these two album tracks. Band made it 70x better, it was awesome. Onto the next intermission. This intermission was BP basically fixing up a bunch of KIA cars before performing their own Tokyo Drift going all around the same level in the parking garage before spelling out BP using the tire marks. 

We come back and it's **Playing With Fire**. MORE FIRE (arsonists stan). Waving my arms to the on-and-on-and-on part is so satisfying. After that was **Kick It** (YEAH). I honestly forgot about this song, but I won't now because the audience screamed YEAH after every Kick It. After that was another talk segment where Jennie wanted to hear the YEAH for herself so she repeated the ""Can I kick it?"" and the audience yelled ""YEAHHHHH"" which freaked them out but they were so up for. This is the part where Jennie said there were only 2 songs left and they wanted to see everyone's faces, phones down kinda thing. Onto the next song which was **Boombayah** which funny enough I think brought **more** phones out. Solid performance, I really wanted to do the full dance with full intensity, but alas there was people around me. Next up was **As If It's Your Last** which is my favourite BP song so bless that they saved the best for last. Fully satisfied with the performance. They didn't really do the actual choreography as much as they just jumped around having fun, but it's all good because everyone else was doing the same thing. Once they were done, lights went out so the only lights left were the lightstick hammers while everyone was chanting encore and BP. Eventually, everyone who didn't have a lightstick like me turned on their phone flashlight. So many people it that the band was clearly visible on the main stage and they were signaling the crowd for noise which everyone was able to do. 

Encore starts with the **DDU-DU DDU-DU remix** from the Kill This Love album. Personally not a fan of it in general, but the live performance was fine since this whole concert was basically a rave for me so it fit right in. People started throwing plushies during the song and Rose was the only one who really paid attention them and she just danced with him like the little kid she is. After that, Jennie going through the band members and the backup dancers which everyone applauded rightfully so. Afterwards, they came back onto the extended stage where people threw more plushies and for some reason a good number of them were birds to which Jennie commented about questioning if there was some underlying joke that they weren't getting or if Canada just loved birds (Hahaha). Jisoo was holding a pineapple plushie and Lisa was carrying this tiny one which she treated as her baby. For a brief moment, Rose sang old McDonald because of all the plushies she had.. Lastly and truly lastly was **Hope Not** which was a beautiful way to end the concert. Lisa was serenading the plushie she had which was so funny and no one noticed until my friend and I pointed it out. At the end of the song, Lisa hugged Jennie and cried which prompted a final group hug as they went down and said goodbye which was oh so touching. With that, the concert was over. My god what an experience that was.

Overall, I give this concert a solid [jellyfish jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWqAf4eex14) out of 10. Endless night of slamming and jamming in my area. My yell-singing continues to coarse through the halls and I haven't felt this much hype for a concert since 3 weeks ago (at the Epik High concert :P). Every song was a blast to sing and dance to and everyone was all up for it which made the environment incredible. Backup dancers did just as well as BP themselves. The band was ASTOUNDING. When I heard the band at the Coachella performance, I was hoping for a band as well and I'm glad they were there because took their songs to the next level. Good amount of fanservice as Lisa and Jisoo kept exchanging kisses and ChaeLisa is as strong as ever. Once BP builds up a greater song collection (STILL WAITING ON THAT FULL LENGTH ALBUM DAMMIT), this concert could rock the GTA's socks off. I'm so happy I ended up going. If you're going to one of their concerts, be hyped or the concert will do it for you.

TL;DR: Reporting this concert for spambops.",17,131

Hello, and welcome to the most ambitious crossover of groups and songs that I have put together on Jukebox that also is in line with a theme ~~otherwise this week's songs would literally just be Girls' Generation's Genie for all seven slots!~~ First, last week's results  artists such as BoA, IZ*ONE, VIXX, and more were featured last week! The highest scoring song (and highest scoring 2019 debut so far) is __EVERGLOW's Bon Bon Chocolat__ with an overall score of **8.32!** Congrats EVERGLOW!

Apologies for not posting a Jukebox Thread last weekend  I was very busy and unfortunately didn't have anything pre-planned. However we're back this week and, in honor of Avengers: Endgame coming out this weekend, instead of doing the usual round of randomization and song submissions, instead, we're going to do something special.

This week, I present to you the most ambitious crossover of groups and songs to appear on this very, very, VERY stacked Jukebox:

^1 : Yes, I am aware this is not an actual Marvel Cinematic Universe song, but nonetheless I still included it because why not.

**DO NOT POST AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR SPOILERS**

First time here? Here's some rules: each week there will be seven songs up for review. Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! ***Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself.*** Alongside your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10. 1 being this song being it's really not to your Fancy and 10 being this song got you feeling like a Marvel Heroine! 

As a special, one-time rule change just for this Jukebox, **all songs this week can also include a music video review to inform your overall score**  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

The same rules for the seven k-pop songs apply for the bonus songs! Again, rating those is optional, but today, we will turn into r/popheads for one week (and one week only) and review some non k-pop songs (albeit very in line with the theme). Also, **you can have the chance to pick all seven songs on Jukebox next week if you can correctly guess the theme**  see the ""Other Business"" section below!

**DO NOT POST AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR SPOILERS**

Song reviews are open up until this Friday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your song reviews in by then!

One group I found while going through youtube suggestions were Cosmic Girls/WJSN (not sure which name is preferred).  I really enjoyed their stuff, but they're obviously not on the same level as the above in terms of youtube views and the singles charts.

What I'm wondering is if they're just not popular in Korea?  There seems to a reasonable amount of buzz on English sites, and their albums and EPs chart well (all 7 charted in the top 10 in Korea), but on the other hand, I haven't found any MV with more than 10 million views and they have no Top 10 singles.

It seems like a weird mix of doing well in some ways while not getting much success in other areas, so I was wondering what the deal was surrounding their fandom.",4,5

Im 21 (yes I know I look 30) and am currently studying Engineering Physics. We recently participated in JTBCs TV-show Stage K, which among other things resulted in us dancing together with Twice on stage. Im going to share some of the stuff that happened throughout the whole process. Feel free to AMA :)


First off, here are all the links:

(Cheer Up - ft Twice)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fog6rULbV5A] 


To make a long story short (can comment the long version of this if people want), JTBC contacted us in December, asking us to audition in Paris in January. The audition went well, and they summoned us to a videocall a few weeks later. They bamboozled us into thinking they were just gonna ask some more questions, but actually revealed we had passed the audition and were headed to Korea to meet Twice.


A couple months later we were in Korea. We were there for nearly 4 full days, and were busy most of the time with scheduled practice, outfitting etc. The 4th day was the shooting. At this point we had met all the other teams and chatted a bit, and we all got along pretty well. When we were driving around in buses they would put team Thailand (a soloist called Nana) in the same bus as us, so us and her became especially close.


So the day of the shooting we woke up really early to get hair and makeup done, and then headed to the Ilsan studio to begin rehearsals. Walking onto the stage the first time was really cool and a bit overwhelming. They let us practice all three dances, and we focused on getting formations down correctly on the new stage. Then came a lot of time sitting around and waiting (and a lot of running to the bathroom). Eventually we were told that Twice had arrived and were filming their Special Stage (the remix of DTNA). We didnt actually see this, so we saw it for the first time on TV. They then showed Twice some of the footage they shot in the teams homes. We had been at the studio since about 9, and it was now about 18:00 and shooting was about to start. 


The first time we actually saw Twice in person was during the intro, where all the teams came on stage and were introduced. When MC Hyunmoo asked Twice who they were most excited to see, they said me, since I was the only dude among the contestants. If I wasnt nervous before, I sure was now haha. We did the first stage, and had a short interview after the performance. Tzuyu said she should learn facial expressions from me, whereby my heart just melted. In the first stage, Twice didnt vote individually, but picked one team to give 100 points. They picked us. Seeing our flag appear beneath them was one of the absolute highlights of the entire thing. So we went through along with Nana.


As is mentioned during the episode, Nana had been a trainee under Cube Entertainment for three years, which we didnt know; she had been told by production not to tell any of the other contestants haha. There was a bit which didnt air where Yubin and Dara argued that she should sign with the others company. Yubin was like she should sign with YG cuz they have better dancers than JYP, whereby Dara went yeah but YG doesnt always handle their idols that well. I thought that was pretty funny.


We did the second stage, and then ensued the most excruciating part of the whole ordeal. Votes were neck and neck right up until Mina cast the final vote. She ended up voting for us. The moment Twice started slowly walking down from their seats to congratulate us was really surreal. I swear, theyre somehow even more beautiful irl. They didnt actually have a plan for how to do the collab stage with 18 people at once, so the next 15 minutes were Nayeon, Momo and Jihyo organizing stuff, splitting people into groups and trying to communicate to us via our interpreter. I actually speak a bit of Korean, so I caught most of what they were saying. None of them speak English well at all, but Nayeon, bless her, did her best: Two left, two right, two front. OK?, First, up!. So we did the collab stage with nearly no rehearsing. We were all super overwhelmed at this point, which you can see by how were struggling to keep proper facial expressions during the performance.

After that we had a few minutes of interacting with them, shaking hands, saying thank you, giving hugs (RIP). They were all (well, mostly) really sweet and kind. Especially Nayeon and Jihyo were really lovely towards everyone. As you can see in the video, Tzuyu and I looked a bit awkward. With me being a dude, and Korean culture and fandom being the way it is, I didnt want her to do anything she wasnt comfortable with. And with her being a massive introvert, we ended up just high-fiving, which they didnt show. Still, interacting with all of them in this way was amazing, and not something Ill forget. They had a busy schedule so they left pretty shortly afterwards. Yubin actually came up to us to chat a bit and take pictures which was cool. We then had a winners interview and then left. It was about 01:00 when we got back to the hotel.


As an addendum, when we were practicing the choreographies and deciding how to put our on spin on them, we had two goals: to make Twice feel like they should step up their game, and to make them laugh their heads off. I think we succeeded in both respects.


All in all, an amazing once in a lifetime experience, one that I wont ever forget. Throughout everything, the staff members were amazing, especially the three that had been responsible for us. We had quite a teary goodbye.",222,1801

I know these things take money but I would think since theyre connected to Columbia Records that maybe they could front the bill to add a little more to BTS stage, even some dancers, a set and different costumes. Nothing too elaborate or costly just some things that could spice up the stage a little and not make it look like a typical music show performance to people like me whove seen them perform the song so many times. BTS have awesome stages in Korea and quite frankly I want to see one of those stages at an American award show (maybe not as elaborate). Dont get me wrong their performances are always great but  I wish they could add a bit more. They could impress so many people if given the chance.",1,0

4250,2019-4-30,2019,4,30,0,bir3sn,Fan Account : MAMAMOO Hello Moomoo in Singapore Fan Meeting,MooMooNyo,1556553355,"Long post incoming. Check the summary or TL;DR for condensed version :D

Date : 27th April 2019

Venue : Zepp@BIGBOX, Singapore

&amp;#x200B;

When MAMAMOO announced their first fan meetings in Southeast Asia late last year in Bangkok, Jakarta, and Singapore, I was hoping that they would add other cities nearby, but they never did. So, I ended up making the short trip down south to Singapore with my girlfriend and our teenage daughter. They are both ARMYs and only casual MAMAMOO fans, i.e they know all the members names and the comeback songs, but not the B-sides.

Even queueing up on-line well before the ticket sales opened, we ended up in VIP E which was to the right side of the stage, though at only 4 rows from the stage it was quite close. They sold out the 2,500 seats. Speaking of the venue, the hall is the only Zepp auditorium outside of Japan. When MAMAMOO had their concerts there, they also performed in Zepps in Osaka and Nagoya. Glad that they or their company insist on venues with good sound quality.

I would estimate the crowd ratio to be 80:20 females, and I think a big portion of the guys were there to accompany their girlfriends. Age-wise, mainly college and late teens. After a brief video intro, MAMAMOO appeared in the Bling Bling version of their Gogobebe clothes (the one they party in in the MV) and when they squatted down in the opening formation for Egotistic, the crowd went wild. They followed that up with Wind Flower. They didnt bring their backup dancers though, so they changed the choreo especially the ending.

We had our first talk segment after that where they introduced themselves as a group (hearing the I say Mama Mama Moo live is a blessing) and then individually. They had a lot of fun learning Singlish and spent the whole show saying things like Thank you-lah, I love you-lah, Sorry-lah, especially Solar. They even said Alamak during the Wheebyul moment (see below). The MC spoke in English and they had a translator, but I think they clearly understood most of the questions though they answered in Korean.

After the break, they sang Better than I thought and No more Drama. The 2nd break followed where they played a game with 4 randomly chosen members of the audience. Each of the 4 members picked out a seat number and all of the 4 selected were really stunned to be on stage with them. MAMAMOO are very down-to-earth with their fans, so Hwasa hugged the fan she chose, as did the other members, and by the end of the game, all 4 lucky fans were the envy of everyone in the crowd. They even individually got to take a group photo with MAMAMOO.

This was followed by a segment called Moomoo Tree where each member chose to fulfill a wish from a fan written on a Post-it note. This was where their vocals truly shined since we ended up getting Moonbyul singing and dancing, Solar singing Moonbyuls favorite song to her, and Hwasa doing Locos rap from Dont with the other members shouting the Hye-jin ah part. All were done with no musical backing, but the highlight had to be Wheein and Moonbyul dancing to Moderato. It was a fanservice for the Wheebyul fans but sadly it was stopped by Hwasa before it got more interesting. Watch the fancam :P

It was back to the music then with Never Letting Go (I Love Too) and Star Wind Flower Sun. I was a bit sad that these were the only ballads they performed. Would have loved to hear Paint Me, I miss you, or Morning. But SWFS did give us the chance to enjoy the voices with minimal background instruments. It was also during this song that Hwasa strolled over to our corner of the stage and sat down on the edge. My daughter kept saying So near, yet so far

We had a short video of the filming of the Wind Flower MV in Hong Kong while MAMAMOO changed their clothes. Kind of like a condensed version of MMMTV. They spent quite a bit of time showing the filming of the drinking scene, with Hwasa hilariously shouting out More Oolong Tea! or One more bottle of Oolong tea, please! instead of beer.

One good thing about going to this fan meeting instead of the earlier ones is that they decided to wear the clothes from the Gogobebe promotions. And they came back with my favorite ones, the green version that they wore on MBC Show Music Core (). Sadly no braids for Wheein. Speaking of Wheein, my girlfriend told me after the show that she couldnt take her eyes away from Wheein the entire time, and that she was much prettier in person than on TV. Something I can definitely agree with. Once you Wheein, you can never Wheeout

They performed Starry Night, Gogobebe and Yes I am, drawing possibly the loudest cheers and fanchants of the evening.

There was another talk segment where they spoke about their feelings performing in Singapore. Hwasa said something like I hope to see you again soon in the very near future so Im hopeful that means an East/Southeast Asian tour. They had earlier announced 2 concerts in Taiwan on the 15th and 16th of June. There was then a video made by the Singaporean Moomoos and there was a surprise birthday cake (in the form of chicken feet!) for Wheein with everyone singing Happy Birthday to her. MAMAMOO sang along and they even harmonized the final Happy Birthday to you!

They then performed a slightly re-arranged version of Decalcomanie before leaving the stage.

After the chants of Encore from the crowd, there was a video of each member giving their personal message to the fans and then MAMAMOO returned wearing the nyonya/sarong kebaya, the Singapore national costume. They performed Waggy (not the most extravagant costume for that song certainly) and then ended the night with Um Oh Ah Yeh. I think they like performing UOAY since it really gives them the freedom to ad-lib all they want. During UOAY, they didnt follow the choreo and each of the members took turns coming over to our side of the stage. And with that it was Goodbyes with Hwasa and Wheein more or less rushing off the stage, lol. The whole show took just over 2 hours and while it was not a concert, it was well worth the price of the VIP tickets + Flight + Hotel.

**Summary/Thoughts**

Most of these are already known, but now personally confirmed.

I thought I was prepared to hear them live, but boy, they exceeded even my high expectations. If you didnt know better and they didnt toss in their usual ad-libs, you would think they were playing the CD.

Solars voice was very clear and powerful. And she was her usual cheerful self. She didnt seem embarrassed at all from her part in Waggy. Though Im not sure if that was an elephant or maybe lion she was trying to imitate.

Moonbyul sings very well and seems to be more confident in not just rapping. She also got the loudest cheers from the crowd.

Wheein is a really good dancer and her dimple is lethal. She does seem the shyest among them during the talk segments, and it was great to hear the Singapore Moomoos cheering for her loudly.

Hwasa was in a playful mood, ad-libbing lyrics and dance moves, and throwing out the Make some noise or Sing to hype up the audience. And when my girlfriend commented on her curves, I just nodded and agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Setlist**

1. Egotistic
2. Wind Flower
3. Better than I thought
4. No more Drama
5. I love too
6. Star Wind Flower Sun
7. Starry Night
8. Gogobebe
9. Yes I am
10. Decalcomanie
11. Waggy
12. Um Oh Ah Yeh

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

The next best thing to watching their concert

They really DO sound as good as the studio version

Theyre beagles when not singing and down-to-earth with their fans

Once you Wheein, you cant Wheeout",25,91

4252,2019-4-30,2019,4,30,1,birfoa,"[DISCUSSION TIME!] In light of the Burning Molka scandal, did your perspective of men change at all?",AsianBibleGirl11,1556555045,"So, we all know far too well how shitty Seungri, JJY, CJH, and the rest are and just how little they respect women. I even saw one comment about this whole mess that went along the lines of ""men are so disgusting that I'm only going to date women now"". But some of you may be wondering, are all men really like that? Do we have to go to the extent of cancelling all men? 

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind, there are probably a lot of men with at least some perverted thoughts. It's just a matter of whether they act on them or not. But I wouldn't go so far as to make a statement like ""all men are trash and disgusting pigs"", because for the most part, I've had good experiences with male friends and relatives. I don't want to demonize the male gender, because I'm guessing there are lots of men, including those in the K-pop industry, who are also disappointed with people like Seungri and how they bring a bad rep to men in general. And besides, it's not even like males are the only ones who can be exploitative and abusive - there are women like Madam Shin, Madam Lin, and Hwang Hana involved in the Burning Molka scandal, whether it be through spreading molka videos, providing for prostitutes, or other means. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a Psychology major,  I always try to look for the factors in a person's life that lead them to commit despicable acts. I can see that for Roy Kim, his problem was that he continued to hang out with the wrong crowd, even after his father advised him to stop hanging out with JJY, and now he might be losing out on his education as a result. For a country like Korea that is still pretty behind on women's rights, a lot of the issue could be traced back to the patriarchal structure of Korean culture and how it enforces or simply condones taking advantage of women and treating them like mere disposable sex objects for men's sick pleasures. And as a Christian (and I'm sorry if my occasional use of profanity may imply otherwise), I don't really believe that people are totally ""good"" or totally ""evil"". Morality is a really complicated thing, and I certainly don't think Seungri was this bad when he debuted at like 15. Everyone, regardless of gender, has the capacity to commit awful sins, but everyone is also capable of doing good in the world, and it's so easy to forget that when a lot of the news only talks about people murdering, raping, or otherwise hurting one another. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I'm not condoning these acts or sympathizing with the perpetrators. They all do need to take responsibility for the countless women they've hurt and be brought to justice. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on whether this whole situation affected your belief system at all - especially you men out there on r/kpop!

I'm seeing NCT127 this Sunday and I'll be seeing BTS next month for the second time. But there are a few groups that I'm really hoping go on tour soon.

Seventeen ~ Seeing them would be the cherry on top of my kpop cake! Their campaign on MyMusicTaste has over 20k points, they've released 3 EPs in the last 2 years, and it has been 2 years since their last tour in the US. I predict that they will come on tour here within a years time.

The Rose ~ They're so good and I really want to see an actual band (if only Day6 had come down south!). They also have over 20k points on their MMT. 

Oneus ~ I would say it is far fethced, but some rookie groups have done some crazy stuff recently, so maybe a US showcase could happen.",195,97
