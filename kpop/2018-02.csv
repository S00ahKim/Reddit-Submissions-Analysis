Screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/FGM6V

I just finished my Apple music trial yesterday and went back to GPM. I was feeling pretty bummed about missing out on some of my favourite songs from Apple's catalogue - but was so surprised when I searched for TWICE (looking for the songs which I had to upload from my own catalogue) to find albums which I didn't have! 

I checked a few other JYP Artists and their discographies were there too! I'm not sure how long they have been available as I have just resubscribed, but I haven't seen it reported anywhere.

Some older releases aren't there like OG Wonder Girls (Similar to SM not having OG SNSD on GPM), but this is awesome news nonetheless!


I also checked Spotify (Australia) and I couldn't find JYP songs on there. ",55,237

#### New Mod Applications

It's been almost a year since we added to our mod team, and we could really use some extra help.  Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for:

* **Experienced with reddit and /r/kpop**: We are looking for experienced redditors with an account that is at least 1 year old. We also prefer users who have contributed productively to this community whether that be with submissions or just thoughtful comments.

* **A strong interest in K-Pop and the subreddit**: We want people that are knowledgeable and interested, so obviously you need to be a fan of K-Pop.  You should also have a desire to make r/kpop a better subreddit and be engaged in discussions like Town Hall.

* **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators**: You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be understanding, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our discord, modmail, and backroom sub, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members.

* **Free time**: You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to carry out daily moderating duties.

* **Thick skin**: K-Pop fans love to promote and discuss their favs. When they are not allowed to do so because of our rules they can get rather salty.  So be prepared to shrug that off.

* **BONUS POINTS**: We need extra help between the hours of 7AM - Noon UTC (4PM - 9PM KST).  If you are available and have access to moderate from a PC during those hours, **please apply**.  It is not required that you have these hours available to get accepted, but anyone who does will be given extra consideration.

Some of the responsibilities of being a mod include:

* Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
* Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
* Enforce the subreddit rules.

##### [APPLY HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/CEOpx2yaYaHKeJ7T2)

The application has several open-ended questions.  Take the time to answer them.  As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered.  You don't need to write an essay, but you'll need to put some effort into them.  None of the answers will disqualify you, so please be honest and accurate with your responses.


&amp;nbsp;

#### Knetz Reaction Posts

We last discussed Knetz reaction posts in the [July Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6em379/town_hall_june_2017/).  Reaction then was fairly mixed.  The mod team feels strongly that these submissions from sites like Netizen Buzz, Pann Choa, and other clones do not provide any value or newsworthy stories to the subreddit.  The comments are often cherry-picked to paint a certain picture that's not always accurate.  For these reasons and others, we **propose to ban submissions where the main focus is the translation of knetz user comments**.  If you feel strongly against this policy, please let us know in the comments and why you think they should be kept.

&amp;nbsp;

#### K-Pop in Western Media

As K-Pop continues to grow in popularity in the West, we are seeing it more and more in traditional media.  We believe it is time to adjust what we consider to be ""newsworthy"" in these cases.  We no longer feel that K-Pop songs playing on the radio or in the background of a sporting event or TV show are particularly newsworthy.  It was a novelty at first, but now it's fairly common and we feel these submissions are better suited to the group subreddits.  We would also like to reconsider ""fluff"" or background articles from Western media outlets like BBC, NBC, Billboard, Vogue, etc.  When these sites post stories about K-Pop, they are often just a boring introduction to a group or the genre with no new info that most K-Pop don't already know.  We would like to know how you feel about these stories though.  Do you think a submission should be newsworthy **ONLY** because it's from a Western media company, or should it also meet the same requirements we have for other newsworthy submissions?

&amp;nbsp;


#### YouTube vs Vlive MVs

A lot of new music videos are being posted to both YouTube and official Vlive channels now.  Currently, we usually allow whichever one was posted first, but we'd like to hear if you guys have a strong preference.  If watching new MVs on Vlive is a pain or a worse experience, then we could favor YouTube submissions when both are posted at the same time or within a few minutes of each other.  If you don't mind either way, let us know that, too and we'll keep doing things the way we have been.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Personal Preference Discussions

A lot of discussions currently posted are really just glorified recommendation threads.  Posts like *""What K-Pop songs do you listen to when you're in a bad mood""*, ""*What song should have been the title song for your favorite group?""*, *""What are the best/your favorite whatever?*"" all revolve around just personal preferences; what songs they like the most, what group they like the most, which idols they like the most, etc.  They have no room for discourse and they're more like surveys than ""real"" discussions.  With the advent of r/kpoppers, should those discussions be sent over there and r/kpop be reserved for discussions with an expectation of discourse, or do you prefer that these types of questions stay here on r/kpop?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Introducing Ko_Ko_Bot

We have a new ""mod"" that's been working for us for a while now named Ko_Ko_Bot, but never gave it a formal introduction.  Ko_Ko_Bot is our Discord bot.  It allows us human mods to remove or approve posts by sending it a command in Discord complete with a removal reason and everything.  The bot is 100% controlled by human mods and **does nothing** automatically.  So if you see a post that was removed by Ko_Ko_Bot, one of our human mods made that decision and sent the command in Discord.  Ko_Ko_Bot will not respond to PM's or replies, so if you have questions about an action it made, please send us a modmail.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",183,34

I pre-ordered the Twice in Switzerland Photobook on the first day which it was available to do so. I compared the prices of Kpoptown to that of multiple others after getting to the pages where it tells you your total after shipping options and taxes, and went with Kpoptown specifically because their price was the best option for me. 

[I just received this email today](https://i.imgur.com/jPCQIW1.png) from them saying that they made a mistake regarding the weight of the item and thus require me to paypal them an extra $9.  A communication error between them and JYPE or anyone else shouldn't be my problem, it is theirs.  Their mistake.  

Like many other people, I don't just buy from one store but that which will be the best option for me, Kpop stuff isn't cheap especially with the shipping. If what I thought was the best deal is held from being sent to me until I send them an extra fee after the fact, then none of that matters anymore. In fairness, I should say that they did offer me the option to message them to cancel. 

It's not really a matter of $9 being a large amount of money, but being contacted after the fact to pay a fee once I thought I had already purchased this item turns me off a lot, and I will for sure be avoiding purchasing from them if I can in the future.

It can be a plot point, a face shot, a dance move, a filter, etc., anything that you love from an MV that wouldn't be on most people's Top MV Moments List. 
Feel free to try and explain why you love the moment if you can!

Here are some of mine:

- NCT U's [red filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA&amp;t=0m15s). I get almost breathless every time I see it. I think it might be because of the dark, gritty, edgy vibe it gives the whole MV, which matches really well with song. I just love it so much and keep going back to it.

- Hotshot's Timoteo [walking away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9s2N7d2aLY&amp;t=0m44s) in the Take a Shot MV. It's a rarely used camera angle and an interesting editing style and Timo plays with it really well. I also love when he was feeling [inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9s2N7d2aLY&amp;t=1m30s) behind YoonSan, and when he is [center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9s2N7d2aLY&amp;t=0m58s) for the choreo because he looks like he's doing ab crunches. On the whole, Timo went absolutely crazy for this MV and I keep going back to his moments because of it.

- Crush's [downwards point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHoLaLlL5lA&amp;t=1m12s) is something I have back-tracked to so many times. 

- Yuju's [fingerpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se8bbsUFjC8&amp;t=1m08s) is iconic to me for whatever reason.

- Lay's [eyebrow raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBD2dt7tRng&amp;t=1m31s) in the Chinese version of Monster. He looks incredible and has impeccable eyebrow control and timing. Ugh, it's so good.

- Seohyun's [hand-flip-thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY&amp;t=0m58s).

- Seulgi's [movements are so smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE&amp;t=0m21s). I also love Seulgi [hyping up Joy and exiting with sassy head movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE&amp;t=1m49s), and Joy's [rope-pull-thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE&amp;t=2m42s) is such an incredible camera shot.

- The fact that Dean dropped the [skateboard on its wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw&amp;t=1m17s) was weirdly satisfying, and then I was hit by [this incredible edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw&amp;t=1m21s) directly afterwards.

And also, if you wish, you can also comment of which songs/albums did NOT stand up against time that well.

My Song Choices:

Haru Haru by Big Bang (2008) - When reading Allkpops Classic K-Pop Songs You Didnt Know are turning 10 years old this year, the first song that came up was Haru Haru, which by memory (dont exactly remember if it was either this song or Lies) was the first Big Bang songs I had ever listened to. I was literally shocked that it has been that long since it came out because it still sounds good, even in 2018.

Mirotic by DBSK (2008) - I was never a Cassiopeia nor have I listened to not a lot of DBSK songs, but Mirotic is a song that I would not get tired of listening to it repeatedly.

Umbrella by Epik High (2008) - Until early last year, I had been trying to find this song and the artist for literally AGES because every now and then, Younhas vocals when singing during Umbrellas chorus were stuck in my brain at random times in my life. It aggravated me because I did not know either the songs title nor who sang it. This continued until last year when I asked my sister (who along with my other sibling, were the ones that got me into K-Pop) in helping me identifying this song by me humming the parts that I could still remember. Immeaduately afterwards, searched it up on YouTube. Lo and behold, it was the song that I was searching for for years and it still sounded as beautiful as I remembered it. Today, Umbrella is one of my all time favorite Korean songs and one of the songs that I listen frequently listen to even though it has been a decade since it first came out.

Into the New World by SNSD (2007) - Even though it has been over ten years since it came out, I personally think that this is still among the best (if not the best) K-Pop debut songs of all time. ITNW has such a timeless feel to it with its sound and lyrics, which helped this song stand up gracefully against time.

251,2018-02-04,2018,2,4,4,7v1npj,Do you think kpop songs or kpop in general could be as commercially successful as it is if it were all just about the music?,gills__,1517687890,"I dont know. I want to say no because of the language barrier but then I remember that English isnt my first language and yet I've been jamming to pop music since I was 5 basically and that I started to listen to Kpop after *listening* to - not watching - Bang Bang Bang.

But at the same time, I'm aware that kpop is what it is today because its a very visual genre. Its what makes it unique and fun and I feel like companies do spend more on the visual aspect of things than the music itself - there are exceptions, but the fact that visuals are important is p.much an uncontended observation.

So, knowing what you know about kpop as a genre and setting it apart, do you think that kpop songs would make it big purely based on the music? Just the music itself - not the artists but their discographies.

What do you think it'll take marketing, image, visual, music style and branding wise for Korean music to become mainstream world wide? Or do you just think thats an impossible feat to achieve? Why so?

**T/N**

When I say visual genre I'm not referring to just the handsome/pretty idols. Referring to the genre's focus on aesthetics over all. From promotional images, logos, light sticks to M/Vs, concepts, outfits etc. 

Its 1:30am rn so I apologise that my comments in the post are a bit ramble-y but my point is basically that do you think kpop songs could get popular in *isolation*? If its stripped of the groups, members, positions, fandoms and all that we deem unique to it except the music - do you think kpop as a musical genre is good enough to have become popular without anything else?

Think of it this way:

####**Would you still be listening to and loving the songs you do if the artists they're by weren't attached to them?**

Sometimes its best to just confession/admit/verbally(?) express opinions on topics instead of constantly holding them back to make others feel better. Im not so much talking about fandoms as I am about something like styling, concepts, should more groups go to America or should they attempt Japan? Should more groups try complex concepts?

For example: in my opinion I detest the current outfit trend of tutus. I dont know WHY theyre happening but it needs to stop. Same with the micro bangs and wearing 90s denim on denim on denim AND throwing on fishnet for that edgy measure. I really wish we could see the return of clean and crisp and FLASHY mvs and concepts. I miss seeing simplistic and stylish concepts and am completely fed up with neon colors with mixed-match animal print or the stylists just grabbing anything in all black and thinking its stylish.

Quick Summary of what happened:
- BM is extra
- Somin is a veteran
- Jiwoo is at par and in sync with the team despite being a true rookie
- J.seph is reserved but is doing a lot to communicate in Chinese and English
- BM said there will be a comeback very very soon.
- Hi-touch was surreal and fast but wow they all look great and better off-camera. Also they are quite thin even BM despite being very buff.
- They all have soft hands and J.seph was noticeably the softest among the 4.

- BM promoting his Soundcloud which I didnt have time to take note. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!!!! (Thanks to u/theangrycamel)

 [1st update: 04 February 2018 2323 (GMT+0800)]

Was seated at the Wild KARD area so had the hi-touch session at the end of the concert. It was initially a standing only concert but got changed around January 18 to a seated one. And I could understand why. 

Organizers may have a booked a bigger than expected venue and would be awkward for our (s)quad to have 3 groups of people and huge gap in between. All the seats for General Admission were filled while Ultimate (front rows) and Wild KARD (middle) had some gaps esp with Ultimate KARD.

I arrived barely 5 mins til showtime and was still able to get a seat in the 1st row of Wild KARD. Was seated next to some young local Cantonese girls who had some grasp of Korean so they were able to help me understand what KARD was saying when BM wasnt talking as the translator was only translating in Cantonese.

Showtime START

Concert Opening Set:

Into You

Outfit for this and the next songs were their black x white promo outfits seen in the MV of You In Me. And wow from the beginning you could really see the performing power of Ms. Veteran Jeon Somin. As the mood of this mini was more serious, the performing faces they had when they were performing any of the songs in this mini was very strong more especially with the girls.

You In Me

Oh god. The performance is so better live and while they were performing, was trying my best to find fanchants since it felt like a disservice if we cant chant loud for em.

Dancing is strong and on point and it seems like that they memorized the whole shebang for the Tour like its second nature to them.

Translator introduce the whole concert tour and this stop in Cantonese.

Second Set

They introduce themselves to us mostly in English with some Cantonese in between and this marks the beginning of what I like to call the BM is Extra Moments.

Trust Me (All KARD ver.)

One of the things, that stood out to me was that Jiwoo may have been tired given the whole touring schedule. Her voice at times felt strained but her movements were still smooth yet powerful like the rest of the team.  If you see this, hopefully youll be okay after this and I hope you all rest well!!

Jeon Somi was killer on stage. Wow. The Boys as usual. S L A Y

Dont Recall

I honestly didnt remember much about this performance not because they were bad (far from it) but I really loved this song  so much and jammed a little too much.

Pre-performance talk

So before they start the next song BM asks us to do arm movement of the point dance for the next song which really marks how very versatile J.seph/Taehyeong as a performer. Of course the way our not so little hype man motivates us to join in was done in his most extra way possible.

Rumor

If this song was any more lit, the audience participation set the whole roof on fire!!!

Ice-breaker before solo stage sets

So the mandatory Ask KARD happens. Your usual qs on hows it like in HK. What food did you guys get to eat. Jiwoo steps out to get changed for the rest of the Ice Breaker.

I liked the insights they gave about themselves with how they deal with stress:
- Taehyeong is PC Bang dude
- BM is our music producer, lyricist, and buff man
- Somin likes to be alone. And my Cantonese was rusty but goes to a cafe if I heard correctly.

A birthday song request to Jacky and to another co-celebrant in the audience known as The-one-over-there-in-the-middle-of the-row-at-the-back (Yup Mr. Matthew Extra Kim.) BM Soundcloud plug.

Random Play Dance Session

Songs played were as follows:
Bbom Bbom by Momoland

I swear to God the whole thing became so entertaining because of J.sephs and BMs expression dancing it. BM even danced the rap break before 2nd verse which made it more fun!

Likey by Twice
Ohmygod. I cannot stop laughing. Somin was great to look at dancing this because it feels like her going back to her days as a cutesy girl group member. But the boys again hahahahhaha

Unknown song
A song that sounds like a track from Rainbow. Not sure as it was just played quickly because it seemed like Somin might have only known the dance partially.

Gashina by Sunmi
Once again the boys just blew me away moreso when they did this the second time around. I am not sure how much air I lost laughing loud.

A few more talks and the solo stages begin.

Solo Stage

- Jiwoo covers Winners Really Really
- J.Seph does his own song. I am unsure with the title so much appreciate your help once more bruvs!
- Somin covers The Taeyeons Fine.
- BM performs Living Good, Pt.2

Talks on why they all chose to perform their respective stages happen after another set of costume change for the last group stages.

Group Cover Stage

Side to Side by Arianna Grande ft. Nicki Minaj
Let me just say good call for censoring certain keywords. But wow that booty movement from Somin and Jiwoo. I still found they guys rap parts shookening but still kept the exciting pace of the song.


24K Magic by Bruno Mars
Wow they all are hype beasts!!!!

Another short talk about the chosen songs for the cover stage.

Final stage (of course therell be an Encore)
Push and Pull


Hola Hola


Encore Stage
Oh Na Na

Living Good


Hi-Touch Session
They have very soft hands like wow. All of them look really beautiful (yes even the boys) up close but I can tell that their reported heights are not their actual heights. I think the boys might be shorter by 2 inches. Somin and Jiwoo were very close to my height. Again, seeing them up close made me realize how much hard work they have to maintain not only performance level but their figures as well. They are really thin in person even our extra buff boy BM

Showed them the pre-ordered album with the stickers which Somin and Jiwoo noticed. But I really wanted to tell Matthew that his bromantic photocard with Taehyeong was shookening even if I had the Somin photocard as well as the Hola Hola one.

I accidentally missed J.seph in my first attempt on my hi-touch because I got distracted by the how good Somin looked and Jiwoo being a bit dazed lol. So had to do it a second time and thats where I noticed how his hands were noticeably softer.

My immediate thought of those on this list goes to:

- U-Kiss (several members left and/or were replaced)

- SPEED (leader left, member replaced, indefinite hiatus issue, then disbanded)

- ZE:A (successful as individuals but not as a group)

- After School (too many member cycles and not enough funding for them to have another comeback)

- 15&amp; (only had one comeback as a duo)

- LC9 (did so many English covers but then a member left, another started their military service, and they fell trap to the indefinite hiatus before disbanding)

- The Ark (only one song before disbandment)

- (EDIT) C-Clown (their comebacks were terrible compared to their debut, it's no wonder they struggled)",238,147

I don't really remember what drew me in the first place, it was years ago when I was a kid and had just discovered South Korea isn't actually the same as North Korea and that's all I can remember. Getting back on track, recently I've just stopped enjoying K-pop, I've had plenty of bad interactions with rabid fans, and the community is in general extremely alienating. Good music too has become hard to find, I don't mind slow or bubbly songs, but there are literally no hard hitting songs anymore, or at least *good* ones (which I know is subjective). It all feels like it's trying to overappeal to a preteen audience, who's tastes I feel like align more with mildly average soundcloud ego-maniacs than people who actually want something that gets the adrenaline pumping.

Don't get me wrong though, I want to enjoy K-pop. I just don't know how to anymore. So I'm hoping people here can at least help me a tiny bit.

Edit: I think worship of Korean culture has also contributed to this indirectly. Browsing the internet and seeing everything I enjoy that isn't K-pop somehow become about K-pop is extremely stressful and overloading. 

Edit 2: I find it weird that people are consistently saying ""don't force yourself"". I'm not forcing anything. I said that ""good music too has become hard to find"". Which is totally different to ""I hate K-pop but I want to like it"". I enjoy plenty of the ""old"" music and most of my problems come from all of the new music that's been recommended to me is all the same and I don't know where to find anything different.",67,0

We had an ASTONISHING **797 responses**. Here's an [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/tUKcK) with the results charted out. Yeah, there were almost certainly better ways of presenting this but I'M SORRY, my work computer is not that great and also I'm not that smart. If any of yall desperately want to see the original data, hit my DMs. If a song you nominated isn't there, it's because it got 0 votes (why did you nominate it). 

(For a summary of what this project is, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7r38ct/song_nominations_now_open_for_rkpop_sings_2nd/).)


As of the moment this post goes live, we are officially opening submissions. Submissions will be closed on **FEBRUARY 28th**. That's a LONG TIME because we want to hear every single one of yall's ^^ah sa^^ran^^ghe yos.

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1.** Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13.

**Step 2.** Get some headphones, preferably ones without a mic, and plug them in. We want to hear **ONLY YOUR VOICE**. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is not set to that channel.

**Step 3.** Open the Wolf music video ([THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAal8xHfV0c)) in your browser.

**Step 4.** Open this page to the Romanised Lyrics (from [Colorcoded Lyrics](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2013/05/exo-wolf-neugdaewa-minyeo-korean-version)) If you want, you can sing along to [this lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5nd5UQzoy0) instead.

**Step 5**. Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, then hit play on the music video, then *chogiwa your heart out.* If you want/can, combine multiple takes to get the best moments of each. Remember that EXO is a whole bunch of people. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, **so do a bunch of takes, then combine the best parts of each into one vocal track**. 

**Step 6**. If you want to do harmonies or adlibs, please record those as a SEPARATE file and include them in the email. 

**Step 7**. Save your masterpiece as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com. Include your reddit name if you want to be credited.

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused, DM me.

**Some general recording tips.** (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).

* If you found a lot of noise in your recording, please leave a 20 seconds gap of silence so the editor can get a good sample of background noise.

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you.

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider making a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it &lt;3.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support.

* If you have to go screamo to hit the notes, back the fuck up please. You will hurt your mic, your throat, and our ears.

* HAVE FUN WITH IT, YALL.

#**FAQ**:

**Q**: My friend from twitter/tumblr/school/fanforums wants to submit, is that allowed?

**A**: Sure as shit is, just tell them to sign up for a reddit account. We're only crediting reddit usernames, no other promotion or linking out.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: Oh boy oh boy I can't wait to hear the song! When will it be finished??

**A**: *In a heckin long time*. Not only are we coordinating 10 editors globally for the first time, Wolf doesn't have an official instrumental (thanks for picking the ONE SM song that doesn't, you turds) so some of our audio-talented members are working on MANUALLY REBUILDING THE TRACK. So be patient. The teaser release schedule will be posted roughly 2 weeks out from release.

&amp;nbsp;

**A**: Can I call dibs on the part where--

**Q**: No. No dibs.

**Q**: Can I do the ad-libs?

**A**: Heck yah you can! Send 'em the fuck in! No guarantee we'll use them, and I can personally promise that anyone who asks for specific parts or is generally greedy about lines will 100% *not have their voice included*. **That's not how this works.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: Yall are amazing, is there anyway I can help??

**A**. We're good on editors for now, we'll reach out again if we need more. We would not object to someone designing the album covers or a R/Kpop Sings logo or teaser images. That'd be cute and we'd love it. We can't pay you, though, because no one's paying us. If you're interested in designing, PM me. We'll chat ;)

Super excited for this yall. Thanks again to our amazing editing team, the wonderful r/kpop mods and the community for being so enthusiastic, and glory be to EXO for providing us with such an amazing song. Let's get [lupine](https://gfycat.com/VacantThoughtfulFlickertailsquirrel) up in here.",70,87

Something about it just feels...close? Like so much of their relationship in the MV is said in little gestures like that. it's not a long drawn out hug or a verbal acknowledgment of what they mean to each other, it's something much simpler...but also so complex?

567,2018-02-08,2018,2,8,10,7w1a7z,"Weki Meki ""Lucky"" Album Giveaway",NudePenguin69,1518053841,"Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened Weki Meki ""Lucky"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things

1.  What album version you would like ([You can find information on the album versions here](https://imgur.com/a/UEWxa))

2.  Who is you Weki Meki bias and why.  If you dont have a particular bias, thats fine, just write what has attracted you to the group.

3.  I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I will leave the entries open for a week and draw the winners on 2/15.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.

Albums will be purchased from Kpopmart.com who have agreed to work with me on multiple shipping locations.

________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either Kpopmart or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!",184,101

This month's theme is **""Idol Raps""**!

Specifically, this should be for those artists that dropped memorable bars (whether masterful or memey) without having all that ""experience"" the former-underground artists had. So, whether they _Always on the Go even though the name is Jay Park_ or they just _Roll Like a Buffalo_, post your favorite idol rap verses, features and/or solos. Submissions should be **at least one year old**.

I'm not sure what game she will be streaming, but it is pretty cool that more people from the K-pop industry are exploring live streaming. Hong Jin Young, who opened her channel [a couple of months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7dbsuv/hong_jin_young_opens_a_twitch_channel_for_gaming/), has been a success, IMO. Hopefully Miryo can have some fun and success with this, as well.

718,2018-02-10,2018,2,10,5,7wgfpz,Rules Overhaul and Town Hall Follow-up,SirBuckeye,1518208837,"Welcome to the Town Hall follow-up post for February 2018.  Thank you to everyone who participated in the thread.  We'll be going over the results of your feedback from the Town Hall, but first we have some exciting news to share.

#### Rules Page Overhaul

We have a lot of rules here on r/kpop.  As time has gone on, we've added to them to keep the sub filled with high-quality content and not overflowing with junk.  These additions and other recent changes have made the rules page a little tough to read and understand, so we set about trying to fix that.  One thing we want to make perfectly clear, this isn't about making new rules, it's about cleaning up the existing rules page and making it easier to use.  Almost all of the rules are exactly the same and there are no major functional changes outside of the new topics in this post.  Go ahead and take a look at [the new rules page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)  We had three main goals for this rewrite:

1.) Bring the full rules in line with the sidebar rules.

* A while back we created ten simple rules that we added to the sidebar to give more visibility to the basic essential rules for new users.  Unfortunately, those sidebar rules had different numbers and wording from the rules on our full rules page, so that was kind of awkward.  You'll notice on the new rules page that the first ten rules are now identical to those in the sidebar.  Now, when we say that you broke ""Rule 6"", you'll know exactly what we mean.

2.) Integrate /r/kpoppers into the rules page.

* When we launched /r/kpoppers in September we never got around to adding rules to r/kpop about what content belongs there or elsewhere.  We have taken this opportunity to do a better job of listing all the types of content that are suitable for r/kpop and the rest of the K-Pop subreddits.  We hope this will make things less confusing for you guys when deciding which subreddit you should post your content in.

3.) Fix the ""Stale Topics"" page.

* The stale topics page became too difficult to use and maintain in its old form.  It was impossible for even mods to keep track of what topics were on the list and when they no longer were stale or when to add new topics to it.  However, in the process of trying to fix it, we realized that we could simply make it obsolete.  Instead of trying to keep track of every thread, we'll just use a blanket guide of ""six months"" for repeat topics and use the search function to find them.  This was what we ended up doing anyway with the old page, and this just makes the whole thing simpler.  We also moved the ""Banned Topics"" list to the main rules page so that everyone can find it.

Let us know how you feel about this new layout and if you have any ideas on how we can improve it.

#### Personal Opinion Discussions

You guys were loud and clear that you don't want us to place further restrictions on discussion topics.  It was never our intention to reduce the number of discussion posts on /r/kpop, we just wanted to improve the quality of those discussions.  However, it seems like you guys like things the way they are now, so we'll keep allowing the same topics we have been.  On the [new rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules) you'll see that the rules for Discussions are basically the same as they've always been.  We tried to clarify things a bit without making any major changes.  If you have additional suggestions on ways we can keep the discussion quality high without restricting too much, please let us know.

#### YouTube vs Vlive MVs

It seems that pretty much everyone prefers MVs to be hosted on YouTube.  So, from now on if and only if the YouTube link is available at the **same time or within a few minutes** of the Vlive link, we will approve the YouTube link even if it was posted second.  If the YouTube link isn't available until an hour or even days later, the Vlive link will stay up and the YouTube link can be added to the comments.  Again, this is only when both links are posted at virtually the same time.

#### Knetz Reaction Posts

We have added a new rule to the rules page.  **""Rule 16: Submissions where the main focus is the translation of Korean user comments are forbidden. These articles are commonly found on sites like Netizenbuzz, Pann Choa, and other similar sites.""**  Feedback from the Town Hall was mixed as we expected, but mods are in agreement with the users who feel this content is without merit.  If the focus of the article is something else besides just the translation of comments, then they would still be allowed.  For example, if knetz comments caused something interesting to happen, or if an idol or company put out a statement or reaction to knetz comments, then those stories would be news and be allowed.

#### K-Pop in Western Media

You guys mostly agreed with us that radio plays and background music on TV aren't newsworthy.  Also, we will start considering the newsworthiness of the content in articles from western media websites.  With the Olympics getting underway, there may be a surge of western articles about K-Pop.  If they are related to the Olympics, we will probably allow them because it's such a unique and global event.

#### Concert Sellouts

We don't consider how quickly a concert sells out to be newsworthy anymore either.  There is usually no context on the size of the venue, how many tickets were available, or even if they were purchased by fans, so this information is kind of meaningless.  Unless the concert is some massive venue that makes it especially newsworthy, these posts should be made in the group subreddits.

That's it for this month.  Your feedback is very important to us, and while we can't please *everyone*, we do our best to listen and carefully consider what you guys want on the subreddit.  Remember, you can reach out to us anytime with feedback via modmail, PM, or on Discord.  Keep the feedback coming and we'll see you next month.

724,2018-02-10,2018,2,10,8,7whn6g,2018 ASTRO Global Fan Meeting in Washington D.C. (180207),tastetherainbeau,1518219567,"Be warned, I'm about to go into fan mode. I've been following ASTRO closely since debut and they're one of my favorite groups, and this is the first time I've been able to see one of my very top groups live and do a hi-touch so this was a super special experience! This is also the first fan account I've written so sorry if it's a mess.

The D.C fanmeet was held at the Lincoln Theater, which is a pretty intimate and cozy theater that Google tells me seats about 1200 people. It was a perfect size for this kind of fanmeet.

####Pre-show:

Doors opening was a bit of a mess. The doors were supposed to open at 6, and maybe they did, but I was far down an alley and shivering cold until well past 6 (the show started quite late too). I couldn't feel my feet. It was raining slightly but thankfully not too much. I arrived alone but it was fun hearing fans around me so excited. I loved looking around and seeing so many fellow AROHAs. Once I reached the door, the staff were very friendly.

Finally entered the building. My seat was around the center (I had P2). Then the show started. Some girl, the winner of a dance contest, performed a solo (forgot what song, it was one of ASTRO's that they performed later) and it was cute.

####Opening performances:

Then the lights went out and we all knew ASTRO would be onstage soon. The hall was so loud with screams, my ears were buzzing. They started playing ""Crazy Sexy Cool"" and it got even louder. I didn't look at any set list beforehand so I had no idea what to expect. I was waiting for them to come out onstage for this song but they didn't lol.

Then the song ended, the lights were off, and one of the members walked out onto the stage and kneeled with his back to the audience. The screams intensified, RIP my ears (not complaining though, I was also screaming). The music started, some dance instrumental music, and the lights went up and I immediately recognized him as **JinJin**. He turned around and broke into this amazing solo dance. From my seat I couldn't see his feet very well but from his legs, it looked like he was incorporating his characteristic fast footwork that I remembered from their [first ever music show stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8hz_nmfKJo&amp;t=30s) with some twirls and more twirls. His hair was red and he looked amazing. Then **Rocky** came out and begins doing a more lyrical, intense, and emotional dance that of course ended with his famous spin. His hair was dark blonde with a middle part and it covered his eyes. It had great movement when he was flying around.

After JinJin and Rocky's dance stage, *""Again""* started playing and the rest of the members appear onstage and I just had to catch my breath. They were all wearing dark leather jackets (though **Yoon Sanha**'s was tan) and black skinny pants. ""Again"" is the song that deserved so much more. I'm so glad they opened the show with it. Moonbin and Rocky had a dance break in the middle and holy shit. I've just got to say right now the **Moonbin** is my bias in this group, he is the reason I got into ASTRO in the first place. He and Rocky are an incredible force.

Then *""Baby""* came on and this was such a fun song. **MJ**'s live voice is amazing. The members were so in sync and the dance is amusing. The lyrics were fun to sing. I now love this song even more than I did before.

####Talk time:

The MC then came out onto the stage and I didn't catch his name but I belatedly realized it was a Youtuber who I used to follow named Shimmy. He did a great job throughout the show.

Half of the members ditched their jackets. Then they all introduced themselves. They each gave an English introduction and said something along the lines of ""I'm happy to be here"" ""it's my first time in D.C."" in obviously pre-memorized phrases which was adorable. Fans screamed after each introduction and from what I remember, the screams were loudest after **MJ** and **Yoon Sanha**'s introductions which made me really happy.

They had the members sit on stools and answer pre-selected questions that were sent in by fans. **Moonbin** was very talkative. **Cha Eunwoo** spoke in English for as much as he could. **MJ**'s answers were always funny. **Rocky** was quiet as usual, I think he only said one thing that wasn't asked of him directly.

I just want to interject here, the girls near the front who were screaming ""ROCKY!"" the whole time (even when members other than Rocky were talking) should be ashamed of themselves. It was already hard to hear what the members and translator were saying in response to the questions because there was a medium level of noise throughout the hall, but then those girls had to keep screaming and just drown out so much of the dialogue. I couldn't hear some of ASTRO's answers. It was really disappointing. I sincerely hope they are still pre-teens so once they mature they won't do this in any future concerts. I found [this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/5gk9vN7.png). Honestly, shame on all of you.

Anyways, this section was fun from the answers I could hear. There was one that stuck out to me, and it was this one: the MC asked,

&gt; Which member pays for meals most often?

and the members each pointed to **JinJin** and **Cha Eunwoo**. There was a bit of talking (couldn't hear some of it) but one of the members (forgot who, maybe Moonbin) said,

&gt; JinJin used to pay for our meals the most but he doesn't anymore

When asked why, JinJin replied

&gt; It's because my mom changed her credit card

LOL.

Another question I remember was asking **Moonbin** his workout routines and he demonstrated some of the routines he does. I hadn't noticed it before, but after that question, I became aware of how built he has become, he's got some muscle!

Another question was about **MJ** playing the girl in their ""Crazy Sexy Cool"" MV. He said that **Yoon Sanha** was supposed to play the girl but he went to the bathroom so MJ was stuck as the girl. Hmmm sure lol

Another question was ""What are your travel necessities?"" and **Rocky**'s obsession with face mask packs resurfaced once again. Throwback to ASTRO PROJECT A.SI.A. This was also when a funny moment happened, during **Cha Eunwoo**'s answer, he was speaking for around 10 seconds and then paused to let the translator translate, then the translator condensed what he said into like 3 words. He sat there waiting for the full phrase to be translated and then when he realized that that was all that was going to be translated he cocked his head like ""oh"". I had to find a video because I can't explain it properly, [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTcpDG0OakA&amp;t=53s).

And another, the question was 

&gt; Who is the best cook in the group and what foods does he cook well

and **Yoon Sanha** answered,

&gt; (in English) Nothing!

It turns out no one in the group can cook well and they rarely cook in their dorm. Then **Moonbin** revealed that he recently made seaweed soup and he wants to cook it for them. **JinJin** replied,

&gt; (in English) I'm fine, thank you

Someone please help them.

####Continued performances:

Then they performed *""Run""* which is a lovely B-side off their latest album. **Cha Eunwoo** teased **Yoon Sanha** by refusing to give him the mic in the beginning. **MJ**'s voice was so smooth.

Then it was time for *""Crazy Sexy Cool""* and oh boy, the fan chants. Thank you for knowing the fan chants, American AROHAs. It made it that much more fun to sing. I forgot how perfect JinJin's rap was in this show. And I love the choreography so much, with the motif of wind blowing. The clean spins that ASTRO does so well, I still can't believe I saw it live.

####Game time:

They played 3 games.

The first was Mystery Box. Having watched a shit ton of Mystery Box videos from Broduce and enjoyed every single one, I was really happy they chose this game. They divided into Hyung Team (older 3: MJ, JinJin, Cha Eunwoo) and Dongsaeng Team (younger 3: Moonbin, Rocky, Yoon Sanha). Shimmy asked each of the teams to say something beforehand. **Cha Eunwoo** said,

&gt; (in English) We win!

Then for the Dongsaeng Team, **Moonbin** whispered something in **Yoon Sanha**'s ear for him to say, then Sanha said,

&gt; (in English) You lose!

and everyone acted like Sanha just dropped the biggest diss in the world.

Hyung Team went first. The mystery object was hard to see from where I was sitting, it was completely flat. They went one at a time. **MJ** screamed multiple times during his. When it was **Cha Eunwoo**'s turn, he took off his jacket so he just had on a white T-shirt. The sleeve was caught at the top, exposing his upper arm, and the whole room exploded in screams, lol. When each of them picked up their hands from touching the object a liquid would drip from it. After smelling their hands they realized what it was, and in the end they said ""egg!"" and got it right. Seems like it was a sunny side up egg.

Then Dongsaeng Team went. Their object looked like a white ball, and from where I was sitting it looked like a whole egg but it wasn't. **Cha Eunwoo** got a look at it and said

&gt; (in English) It's moving!

when it obviously wasn't haha. Dongsaeng Team was concerned.

They threw **Rocky** under the bus and made him go first. He was really freaking out, could barely touch it. **Yoon Sanha** freaked out a bit too and I think pulled apart the object a bit. When it was **Moonbin**'s turn, he just went for it and squeezed the object. Some of it stayed on his fingers and smelled it and freaking ATE IT OFF HIS FINGERS. When it was their time to guess, I think Moonbin guessed "" (flour)"" but it ended up being a ball of mozzarella cheese.

So Dongsaeng Team lost and their punishment was to write their (romanized) names in the air with their butts, and were instructed to do it as sexy as possible. Not my favorite game at all, I could hardly watch. **Rocky** was living for this game. They made **Yoon Sanha** do his full name including his surname lol. He made it a cute version.

The next game was the dance guessing game. They were paired into 3 random groups and chose which was the dancer and which was the guesser. It was kinda like charades where the dancer is given popular dances and the guesser has to guess which dance they're doing. They had to guess as many as they could in one minute.

The scores:

1. dancer Moonbin, guesser Cha Eunwoo: 7 
2. dancer Rocky, guesser MJ: 5
3. dancer Yoon Sanha, guesser JinJin: I think only like 2. Sanha kept saying ""pass, pass!""

The highlight of this section was **Moonbin**, he was so good. I'm going to need a full dance cover of ""All the Single Ladies"" please.

The punishment was making the 4 losers do 40 pushups per team. **Yoon Sanha** went first. He could have just done 1 pushup and left the rest to JinJin, but he chose to do all 40 by himself. I did not realize that maknae could do 40 pushups, that was a surprise. Then it was the other team's turn. **MJ** made a big show of not knowing how to do a pushup, with bad form and his butt up in the air, but then he actually got into position and did 40 good pushups by himself. What the heck, was not expecting that either.

The last game was basically a Random Play Dance with popular kpop songs. One of the songs was from BTS, I think it was ""Dope"" and ASTRO, being experienced in BTS covers, did a great job sans **Cha Eunwoo** who lagged behind a bit. I forgot what the other dances were.

####Final performances:

Then came my favorite portion of the performances. They announced their next song, """" and there were less excited shouts in the audience than expected, but then I realized that the fans probably didn't know which song it was because they said the Korean name. Then the song (*""Breathless""*) started playing and the audience roared. They knew the fan chant to this as well. I've got to say, shout-singing this song was really freaking fun. My throat was almost dead but I sure as hell shouted those ""YAPPAPPA! BARABWABWA! NAPPAPPA! NAREUL BWABWA! YAPPAPPA! BARABWABWA!"" and it was exhilarating. The choreography to this was so fun too, the jumps and the ups and downs, it was so high energy and so summer 2016. This was the oldest song they performed (was holding out for them to do Hide &amp; Seek, I might've actually cried if they did that song). So so so much nostalgia. I didn't want it to end.

Finally they drew their show to a close with *""Confession""* and they were sure to announce the title in English this time. Another high energy song where the instrumental reminds me of something like an anime opening. The dance to this is one of their cuter ones, especially where they're ""confessing"" with their hands behind their backs and plugging my bias once again, **Moonbin** is an absolute natural. Whatever the mood of the song is, whether it's a smooth R&amp;B or one of their cuter bops, he absorbs that mood. He's a freaking chameleon. 

####Closing remarks:

They each said their goodbyes. I don't remember much of this part (it was also hard to hear) but I do remember **Cha Eunwoo** talking in English about how they had done some sight-seeing in D.C. He said they went to the ""big tower"" and someone corrected him that it was called the Washington Monument lol. They thanked us for waiting for them, and they promised to come back. ASTRO, I don't know what Fantagio's new management will do with you, but please do come back.

####Fan song + encore:

**Yoon Sanha** then taught us the special dance to their fan song *""You &amp; Me""*. It consisted of lots of hearts and clapping the hands of the fans standing on either side of you. It's the cutest thing in the world. The song had so much fanservice and goofing off onstage. The best part was when **MJ** stole **JinJin**'s rap part and JinJin was just hyping the heck out of MJ and then they laughed hysterically afterwards. Had to find a video of this too, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wee-EXPZQIs&amp;t=1m20s)

They left the stage and we shouted our hearts out for them to come back on. Then they appeared again, this time everyone wearing black shirts and holding baskets. Their last song was *""I'll Be There""* and they threw a bunch of little yellow things into the crowd which I later found out were little Valentine-themed Haribo gummy bear packs. They were sure to throw them up to the balconies closer to the stage which was nice. Fans came up with their phones and some members took them and recorded videos on stage, others just did cute things in front of the phones.


####Hi-touch:

Here is the part where /u/tastetherainbeau almost died (figuratively speaking).

They set up a table on stage and the members stood on the other side. The order was: JinJin, Yoon Sanha, Moonbin, Rocky, Cha Eunwoo, MJ. I immediately thanked heavens that **Cha Eunwoo** was not first, because I knew I would go into shock after seeing his face up close. It happened to me with Jaehyo, it happened to me with Bang Yongguk, and now I was about to witness one of the most perfect faces in Kpop so it was very important that he wasn't first.

Approaching the table I could only look at the ground, then I came face to face with **JinJin**. He looks much thinner up close than he does online. His eyes were sharp. I was really taken aback. Next was **Yoon Sanha**, was just adorable. Then **Moonbin** and that's when my heart just raced.

If anyone is hesitant to buy a more expensive ticket that would give them a hi-touch, it is really worth it. The way they make eye contact with you makes you feel *human*. For a split second all your bias is doing is looking at you and thanking you for coming. As an international fan it makes everything worth it. I know it's just a thing everyone does and it's not that deep but it really was a special moment.

Anyways continuing, next was **Rocky**'s brilliant smile and then it was **Cha Eunwoo**'s turn. His face was also thinner in person and is still imprinted in my mind. After that, I am so sorry but I don't remember **MJ** whatsoever. I knew that would happen. I'm sorry, MJ.

My friend asked me to try to remember who had the softest hand but I was concentrating too hard on the visual aspect of the experience that tactile sensations did not even register in my brain. I did keep my left hand immobile for a long time afterwards. I can't remember what I was doing with my other hand but it was probably covering my face, so I probably looked like a complete idiot.

As we were exiting the stage, the girl behind me started crying out of happiness.

I met up with some people afterwards and waited for them in the lobby. This girl came out and she presumably had a P1 ticket so got to do the photo with them. She started sobbing, hard. She still hadn't stopped when I left. Whoever you are, I feel you.

_______________________________________________________________

**If you read my Weki Meki giveaway post, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened CLC ""Black Dress"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

1.  What is your favorite CLC song?  Are you a fan of their poppier work or do you prefer 4minute CLC?

2.  Who is your CLC bias and why.  If you dont have a particular bias, thats fine, just write what has attracted you to the group.

3.  I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I will leave the entries open for a week and draw the winners on 2/15.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.

Albums will be purchased from Kpopmart.com who have agreed to work with me on multiple shipping locations.

________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either Kpopmart or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

[Entries are still open for the Weki Meki give away!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7w1a7z/weki_meki_lucky_album_giveaway/)

**You ARE free to enter both giveaways.  To keep things fair, in the unlikely chance that someone wins BOTH giveaways, I will give them the option of which one they want more and redraw for the other one.**

I love second gen varieties like Star Dance Battle, Star Golden Bell, and Strong Heart as well as new ones like Knowing Brothers; but are there any new concepts?

I would love for idols to try out a restaurant/cafe variety like Youn's Kitchen or Kang's Kitchen. Have idols famous for cooking come in and run the kitchen (head chef/main mc Kwanghee, sous chefs Jin, Wendy, Taeyong, JJCC Eddy, D.O) and idols with fun personalities in the waiting staff. It'll be a fun concept and a cool way to bring idols together. Obviously, both Youn's Kitchen and Kang's Kitchen are very popular shows rn and plagiarism accusations will run rampant, but it's just wishful thinking on my part.

---

I'll try to talk about Red Velvet! It'll definitely be a while till another Red Velvet comeback  but  I think they will continue to explore more mature aspects of their Red &amp; Velvet sides since it proved successful in their very recent comeback. 
SM's production team might continue to explore synthy electronic styles for Red Velvet from looking at B-Sides such as [I Just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXk4YQZ8yR8) &amp; their most recent [comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE). I think its also a safe 
bet since such styles continue to be a kpop trend overall.

A wilder guess for me is that they will incorporate elements from future-core (*hybrid of future-bass + hardcore, example:[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rIxlKtgsqI),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TarjGuskopM)*) to create an odd but upbeat track like [Russian Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslJYDX3o8s).

I personally would like more soulful gems like [Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px2Q47O0_eE), [Kingdom Come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJEAMow2A4o) &amp; [Perfect 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cdOFuPPdDU) since no other girl groups go for RnB quite like Red Velvet imo. However I'm honestly satisfied with any direction they take as long as they keep the fun &amp; experimental elements in their music.

Just gonna copy/paste what I said last week: You know what to do! Leave your review as a reply to the comment with the artist and song title in it! Leave with your review a score between 1 and 10. You can talk about the song, the lyrics, ~~Rose mopping the floor~~, whatever you feel like talking about! Its your space to give your opinions. If a song has an [MV] tag that means you can review the MV as well, but thats totally optional! You can review songs up to 8:00 PM PST by next Friday. Reminder: I dont pick em, I just randomly generate them. Screenshots later. Did pick one song this week, that was the TVXQ one.

Just gonna copy/paste what I said last week: You know what to do! Leave your review as a reply to the comment with the artist and song title in it! Leave with your review a score between 1 and 10. You can talk about the song, the lyrics, ~~Rose mopping the floor~~, whatever you feel like talking about! Its your space to give your opinions. If a song has an [MV] tag that means you can review the MV as well, but thats totally optional! You can review songs up to 8:00 PM PST by next Friday. Reminder: I dont pick em, I just randomly generate them. Screenshots later. Did pick one song this week, that was the TVXQ one.

I think her voice would be lovely to hear singing Hozier's song, and especially nice in Daniel Caesar's. Additionally, I'd love to hear Sunggyu's rock (or something like it) of Take me to Church if that is possible.

Also, to make it extra fun, if it were to happen I'd love to hear Lee Hi sing with Zhavia from the Four. Maybe a collab or featuring. ",31,20

But had other members been given or come across an opportunity, who do you think couldve been just as popular or even more so? 

For example, I always that that Hyejeong in AOA couldve been more popular than Seolhyun. When AOA was becoming even more popular with miniskirt, i thought that was totally hyejeongs era and chance to get noticed.

Also the popularity of Kang Daniel got me thinking about GOT7s Jb. The visual traits that got Daniel popular reminded me a lot of JB. The eye smile, mole(s) around their eyes and broad shoulders. They both have a soft side especially for their cats and when on stage, deliver manly concepts very well. So it made me think people were really missing out on JB because they assume Got7 is just Jackson.

An example I can give in AOA is Yuna, who is often given a lot more singing time and fun lines in album tracks. I can only assume it's because Choa is a wonderful performer. My friend also brought up that SNSD's Sunny tends to be the star of a lot of SNSD b-sides.",57,43

841,2018-02-12,2018,2,12,0,7wtblk,"Musically (Based entirely on the quality of their songs), which Girl Group would be your favorite?",Zenosignia,1518362456,"Mine would undoubtedly be *After School*. Even now, their songs remain classics, timeless, have withstood the test of time, while I have mostly outgrown songs from girl groups from the same era.

*Because of You* stands as my absolute favorite K-Pop song of all time, and up to now I have never listened to anything as beautiful.

AS has:

- Because of You (already explained)
- Shampoo (nice melody, beautiful choreo, and the lyrics are achingly sad)
- First Love (catchy, love the beat)

Those are their three best songs in my opinion, but they have other decent ones:

- Flashback (After School at the peak of their sexiness)
- Bang (very unique concept)
- Diva
- Heaven (A Japanese only release, one of my favorites)
- Amoled

Not to mention Orange Caramel's *Catellena*, *Lipstick*, *Magic Girl*, *Aing*, and *My Copycat*, as well as Uee's quiet *Soksoksok*, if we're counting songs from sub-units and solo projects.

What about yours?",212,52

My first chance meeting was with Wonder Girls Sohee, Yubin, Sunye, and Hyelim. 

My brother and I were dropping off our grandpa at the LAX airport and while my mom and my grandpa were checking in baggages, we decided to sit in a secluded area at the food court, and sat right next to the table where Sohee and Yubin were, along with a couple people that was with them. I clearly remember telling my brother they look like Sohee and Yubin and he just goes, ""It is them."" They were eating In-N-Out and we just sat there quietly for like 15 minutes trying to figure out if we should approach, ask for an autograph/picture. Eventually, I came back to where the check-in lines were to ask my mom for paper and pen, and on my way I saw Sunye and Hyelim just walking around. We eventually approached them and asked if they were the Wonder Girls, to which they didn't answer at first then hesitantly said yes. Then I asked for an autograph, not a picture because I'm pretty sure they would say no and they were also bare-faced and in very casual clothing. Sohee was pretty stoic the entire time and Yubin was more friendly. They asked for our names, and I shook hands with them and said ""Have a safe flight,"" to which Yubin said thanks in reply. I forgot the exact date but this was probably 2011. 

Met Amber at Sul and Beans patbingsoo shop in K-town.

Was just there to grab some dessert, and shortly after we sat down, Amber strolls in with another person. There was probably 5 customers in the store at the time, and again I said, ""She looks like Amber,"" then my friend says ""It is!"" Then the cashier started playing f(x) songs, then I waited for her to order and approached saying how I'm a big fan and if I can ask for a picture. She was super casual, super nice, and when I was fumbling for my phone I muttered something along the lines of, ""I'm shaking, I'm shaking,"" and Amber looks me in the freaking eyes and just goes ""Don't shake, don't shake!"" Then we took the picture, I said I love her, f(x), and their music, talked about watching the stream for their first concert. She told me to go to their concert and I said you guys should have it here and she says ""Maybe in Japan?"" and that was it. Then we left the store and she was just chilling with a friend but at some point she threw one of her shoes and it was kinda weird and funny. 

Met Sunny while in line for Howlin' Rays in Chinatown. 

We have been in line for about 3 hours at this point, and all of a sudden I see Sunny walking along with her sister, Soy of Soshified and another male. This was over just this past winter break, btw. SNSD is my bias group so I thought I was going to die. I knew she probably wouldn't agree to a picture since it was about a week after Jonghyun's passing, she was wearing very minimal make-up, and was also dressed casually. I approached her, smiled, and said that I loved her music and thanked her for being a source of inspiration. She smiled and said thanks. However, my group of friends were pretty rowdy and one of them forced me to ask for a picture so we went and she asked in Korean for me and Sunny politely declined, and I just said that's okay and thanked her again and told I've been a fan for a long time and I loved their music. 

Anyways, yeah those are my experiences. It's just weird to think that somehow stars aligned to have this chance meetings happen, and I'm really curious about other people's story. If anyone really wants proof, I'll post something but yeah! Excited to hear some fun stories. 

tldr; shared my experiences meeting Wonder Girls, Amber, and Sunny in Los Angeles ",19,34

EDIT: I meant kpop songs/albums on the title. 

If this has been posted before mods, please do take this down.

The Pinkerton effect is based off the album of the same name by Weezer.

The album wasn't well received when it was first released, but as the years went by, it's now considered as an amazing album. 


A bit like wine, gets better with age.


The few songs that I can think of are:

I'm going to pick an obvious one: Hwang Minhyun. He [created](https://youtu.be/2flIFl7dLlM) the legendary Sorry Sorry Team 2 based on each member's strengths, most notably pointing out that Kang Daniel ""draws people's attention"" back when he was still 23rd. When Never team was voting to kick people out, Minhyun predicted at least the top 5 of the remaining team in the right order. Overall, Minhyun is good at making insightful observations, being analytical, and being organized, so he'd be really good at being a CEO.",89,155

Lyrics like ""don't deny our r squared pi"" and ""shut your tongue"" were sprinkled in so many kpop songs.

I can't tell if I became super desensitized to it or if kpop producers stepped up their game, but I can't seem to remember this happening in the past couple of years. The last time I remember it happening was in lovelyz ""you're the best ever come in my life"" candy jelly love back in 2014.

Any recent examples (let's say post 2015) of English being poorly used?

There were years where I was GRIPPING onto every teaser / social media / kpop blogs to read the latest (anyone remember 'BEST FICTION'?). One year in particular in which I became OBSESSED with K-Pop was 2009; albeit me listening since 2007.

2009, to me, was the beginning of the 'Hallyu-Wave' and the imperial phase of modern pop music. I felt like it was Korean Pop music was challenging the Western Pop world with more of a disciplined, focus approach to the overall package (music, visuals, MV's, album covers, etc.). 2009 also felt like the year of *so many debuts*, good debuts too.

* 2NE1
* After School
* T-ara
* f(x)
* 4Minute
* Rainbow
* MBLAQ
* Secret
* Beast

Girls Generation, KARA, Jewelry and Brown Eyed Girls were also dominating that year with incredible music. It's a shame that most mentioned have disbanded.

So I want to know, whats your FAVOURITE year in K-Pop and why?",81,50

Here's a little proof picture ft. the Poster I got from the fansigning and wristbands- [pics](https://imgur.com/a/jhzWI)

Anyways, I arrived with my group around 2:45 PM to pick up our wristbands. We had both wristbands for the fansigning and for the VIP entrance to the actual concert. After waiting out in the rain for almost an hour, we were able to get our bands- just in time for the fansign which starter at 4:00 PM.

For the fansign, they had everyone line up outside again and then brought people through the line about 20 at a time up to the room where Dreamcatcher was sitting. Before we got to see the members, we were all handed a poster as seen in the image above and then got to go through the line to meet each member and have them sign the poster. I think most people had the poster signed, but at least one person had one of their Dreamcatcher albums signed instead. I had made plans about various questions I wanted to ask the members in Korean, but found that we were being rushed through the fansign way faster than anticipated- however I still managed to get a number of questions in!

The order was Dami, Gahyeon, Yoohyeon, Siyeon, JiU, Handong, SuA. So, these were the questions and responses I managed to get. I am a big fan of their covers of other songs so I asked a lot about that- 

Q for Dami: What rapper do you want to do a cover of?

Dami: Kendrick Lamar

[Q for Gahyeon: What kind of alcohol do you want to do an alcohol commercial for?
](https://youtu.be/7Ii5g-efZyg?t=48s)

Gahyeon: Any- I like all alcohols.

Q for  Yoohyeon: What K-pop singer do you want to cover?

Yoohyeon: K.A.R.D

Couldn't think of anything to ask Siyeon- so I just told her that she was awesome and we high-fived!

Literally had no time to talk to JiU before I got asked to move. 

Didn't remember what question I wanted to ask Gahyeon so I just said she was a trilingual queen! (true facts)

Q for Sua: What Kpop singer/group do you want to cover?

Sua: EXO

(After this she asked my friend who was behind me if they liked EXO lololol)

Anyways, it all felt very rushed! Some people complained afterwards that they had seen videos of the fansign in Brazil and that people got more time- but I was at least happy to get a couple questions in!

The concert doors didn't actually open until 7:00 so my friends and I had a bit of downtime and grabbed some food before lining up around 6:15 outside again in the rain. We ended up grabbing a plastic bag to protect our posters. Around 7:05-ish (I think) they started letting us into the room from the VIP section. It had been advertised as there being separate VIP and General standing sections, but really all the difference was was just entrance time. Unfortunately, if you were in the standing section and wanted to buy merchandise, you had to wait in a very long line in the room of the concert on the opposite side from the stage- so buying merch kinda meant sacrificing a good standing location. 

The concert itself wasn't meant to start until 8:00 PM- so up until about 7:40 they played random non-Korean pop songs at which point it switched to some of the Dreamcatcher title tracks to get people hype up. 

Here was the set list:

1. Chase Me
1. Sleepwalking
1. Trust Me
1. Lullaby
1. Cover of Just Give Me a Reason by Pink (Gahyeon, Yoohyeon, Sua, Dami)
1. Cover of Sunday Morning by Maroon Five (Siyeon, Handong, JiU)
1. Cover of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together by Taylor Swift
1. Cover of Into the New World by Girls' Generation
1. Cover of Lucky Strike by Maroon 5
1. Dance cover of Believer by Imagine Dragons
1. Emotion
1. Full Moon
1. Fly High (Finale)
1. Good Night (Encore Pt. 1)
1. Cover of Regret of the Times by Seo Taeji and the Boys (Encore Pt. 2)

There were a number of Breaks- 

Between 2 and 3 they did an Introduction to the members, between 4 and 5 they answered fan questions that had been put on post-its- (this included an impromptu rendition of Really Really and dancing to Gashina ofc.) They also tried to pronounce some words in a British accent and answered about their favorite desserts. **One of them tried to claim Ramen was a dessert** (I think it was Yoohyeon). Between 9 and 10 they announced the random winners of the polaroids they had taken before the show. Between 11 and 12 they discussed their impressions of London and the concert (saying that the next two songs would be the last. Gahyeon also literally started biting her tie during this section- I really hope someone got a photo cause it was hilarious. After it ""ended"" and seeing how they had just neglected to mention performing Good Night, there was a general vibe that it wasn't actually over. Everyone started to chant Encore and Dreamcatcher comes back on!

Anyways, I didn't write up full descriptions of all the performances, but there were a lot of people filming so I imagine that videos will be posted of all of them on youtube! But if you have any specific questions let me know!

After the concert, they announced that they needed to set up for the Hi-touch so everyone with VIP tickets was sent to a room right outside of the concert hall. We all waited there for about 15 minutes until they had set up and we all got to go through a line, high-five each member and say a quick word- I just asked them all to come back to London! (really didn't have much more time) and then we were handed a packet of photocards specific to the concert series- one card for each member.

It was a really amazing concert. The girls are all so so so so talented in a bunch of ways. The dancing was incredible, the singing was incredible (OMG Siyeon's high notes people!!!) and yeah- just an incredible experience. I already want to go back and see Dreamcatcher in concert again! And of course if you have any questions feel free to pm me or ask below!

1176,2018-02-15,2018,2,15,21,7xq5bq,Weki Meki / CLC Giveaway Survey Results + Whats In the Future For Giveaways?,NudePenguin69,1518699115,"Well, I have successfully wrapped up my first 2 giveaways and the winners have been notified.  I want to thank everyone who participated, I got nothing but kind words from everyone, so it made it very enjoyable to do.  If you didnt win, I hope you will try again in the next giveaway!

One of the perks, for me, of doing the giveaways is that I get to ask for a little something back from you guys.  In both my giveaways, I had people answer a few questions about the groups (who is you bias, favorite song,ect) as the entry.  The reason I wanted to do this is because one of the things I aim to do with these giveaways is to not only support the groups, but build our community as well.  One of the great things about free stuff is that people will go a little out of their comfort zone to have a chance at it.  As such, I ask these questions because I think its great when we can share what we love about these groups and show our support for them.  

I enjoyed reading all the entries, and I have compiled the answers into some data points that I think are interesting, so I thought I would share them.  Remember that these results are only based on the 160 entries into the Weki Meki giveaway, and the 133 entries into the CLC giveaway, but I think it provides a decent look at the active fan-base of each group on this subreddit.  Anyways, here you go:

________________________________________________________

__________________________________________________________________

The other thing I wanted to do in this post is give you guys an idea of what you can expect in the future.  

As I stated in my posts for my giveaways, the reason I do this is to support the groups that need it most.  As such, I believe in spending more on rookie, nugu, or struggling groups rather than groups that are already doing well.  As such, here is a list of groups that I am considering doing giveaways for in the future, should they release a new album:

Dreamcatcher

Stray Kids

P.O.P

Marmello

Weki Meki

CLC

Momoland

Oh My Girl

AOA

Laboum

Brave Girls

FtIsland

Cosmic Girls

Gugudan

DIA


Now, I am NOT saying I am guaranteeing a giveaway for all these groups, but that they are the ones I would most consider.  

As you can see, that list is fairly long already with just groups I specifically care a lot about, so yes there may be other groups that could use the support, but I have to draw the line somewhere, so if there is a group you like that is not on the list, I am sorry, but my funds are finite. 

______________________________________________________


If you have any questions, suggestions, or other comments, feel free to let me know in the comments!

Good luck in future giveaways!

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment

Some things to consider..

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2. for the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web.

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P",13,4

The JYP whisper, ""I need a cha-cha beat boy"" and of course, BUH-RAVEU SOUND.  The unique thing about Brave Bros. producer intro is that unlike others in Kpop where the tag is casually dropped, ""Brave Sound"" is frequently incorporated into the timing and opening lyric of the song so deeply that it is considered part of the song itself.  Even something as simple as [""Speed!  Yeah, and Brave Sound""](https://youtu.be/mQUwJxKkhNo) works so well.  So which are your favorites.  I am extremely partial to T-Ara's So Crazy intro because I was pretty obsessed with that song for a while so whenever I hear that opening percussion I immediately break out into doing the finger dance and repeating the fantastically pronunciated English.

So judging a song completely based on its chorus and excluding parts like verses, pre-chorus, etc.  

I was mainly thinking about this since I recently decided to get into Gfriend and have thought that their choruses are just really good in general. The chorus in [Rough](https://youtu.be/0VKcLPdY9lI?t=1m5s) is amazing, totally elevates the song imho. I also felt that way about one of their b-sides [Hear the Wind Sing](https://youtu.be/PpoBd_kskq8?t=46s).

Obligatory LOONA reference: I like to think that Sweet Crazy Love is a pop masterpiece in general but [the chorus](https://youtu.be/cG7FkoNKBzI?t=1m18s) is the best part. 

The chorus in [EXO Forever](https://youtu.be/ypsQ-2BMLDU?t=1m) gives me chills. 

And for a throwback I'm guessing [KARA Step](https://youtu.be/zYoYoBtLqOY?t=48s) has indisputably one of the best choruses in K-pop. ",138,123

The first one is Rookie, I somehow thought Joy was singing ""boys are men, boys are men"" here ([at 0:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCHeBmuhNEc&amp;t=35s)), but she's actually saying ""beolsseo nal, beolsseo nal.""

Second one is with Russian Roulette, I thought at the chorus they were singing ""don't eat me"" [at 1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJQ6ev5LQ6A&amp;t=59s), but it's actually ""neon imi"". I probably somehow confused the concept with Red Flavor since that one has fruits lol.

Those specific examples are probably just me, though. What are yours?

Edit: Maybe it's just me, but somehow the comments doesn't seem to show up?

1373,2018-02-19,2018,2,19,14,7ykfg6,NBC special feature during Sunday night primetime coverage: K-Pop with Eric Nam!,Rainedout788,1519017941,"At the end of the Sunday night coverage of the Olympics on NBC (after the ice dancing figure skating), they ran a special feature on K-Pop. Tara Lipinsky and Johnny Weir, two of the commentators for figure skating, met with and interviewed Eric Nam. It was cool to hear Eric talk about his creative process and his insights, given that he can describe it well to American audiences because of his fluent English. 

They played parts of his song ""Can't Help Myself"" and showed him in the recording booth doing his thing. When asked why go with the K-Pop industry instead of the American pop industry, he said, ""To be honest, I think K-Pop was the genre that gave me the opportunity. I don't think that American or Western audiences were ready for an Asian face in music. I think now they are, now people are opening up their eyes and ears and being a lot more accepting, but 7, 8, 10 years ago, we didn't have these opportunities. I've never seen an Asian face doing music in the States."" 

He then discussed how he was discovered (Korean company saw his YouTube cover of ""Lonely"") and how his career unfolded. He talked about his creative process, and how he writes songs in English and then has help translating it into Korean and making sure the songs still flow and make sense. (He sang a few lines from an upcoming song he's working on: ""I wish I had no shame / I wish I felt no ways / Wish I could do what I want and feel no pain / I wish I could hurt you / The way that you hurt me / Wish I could do what I want and feel no shame."") Kim Boa was briefly featured helping him translate it into Korean. Then he talked about the appeal of K-Pop and how lucky he was that he had this opportunity to be in the industry.

They also showed footage from KCON LA 2017I saw Donghae/Eunhyuk greeting fans, KARD dancing onstage, and some other groups (QQ I'm sorry, I didn't recognize them all because the clips went by so quickly)and throughout the feature, they played bits of BTS's ""Fire"" and ""DNA."" It was a brief/shallow dive into the world of K-Pop all things considered (nothing that a serious K-Pop fan wouldn't already know), but it was still very cool to have K-Pop acknowledged on NBC!",27,213

1432,2018-02-20,2018,2,20,4,7yp8bn,What is your opinion on idols acting in dramas/movies?,LemonJongie23,1519067915,"For me I think it depends on who it is and how long they have been in the industry. Like Key (SHINee) for example, he's been on shows and dramas and stuff before so I think he has truly earned to be on this upcoming movie he's going to be in. However a member in EXO or BTS or groups like those if the member has never acted ever and has a ***major*** role in a movie or drama then I think its unfair to actors like Lee Minho or Kim Woo Bin who are actual actors, especially if the idol has never acted before in his life. Sungjae, Minho, Onew, Lee Joon, T.O.P etc have been in things before and movie directors probably actually reach out to these idols, whereas I could see SM or BigHit reaching out to the directors and be like ""my very famous popular idol being in your show/movie would be great publicity"" (which I feel is what SM did with Kyungsoo for Its Okay Thats Love) or JYP did with Suzy (or I may be ignorant and she might have done some acting before, I dont follow many girl groups) like I understand an idol can both be an idol and an actor but I just think sometimes its insulting to actual actors when this idol has a major role *just* because he's really popular",27,0

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)
	

**[Son Hyo Kyous 1st Concert Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonhyokyou/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 27, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Son Hyo Kyou?

Son Hyo Kyou is a soloist signed to Choon Entertainment.

He debuted in 2015 with the single [White Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r33vwKQ1jvw) and has been releasing at least one digital single a year since. His most recent single was [We Should Have Been Friends]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4rYn77o6Wk) in 2017.

I havent been able to find much else about him in English.

**[Mckay Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mckay/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 28, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Mckay?

Mckay Kim is a singer-songwriter from San Diego, California. He is most well known for appearing on K-pop Star Season 2 in 2012, where he was placed in the team Raccoon Boys. The team ended up placing 5th in the competition, and he eventually signed to Dorothy Company. However, he is currently signed to U.P. Music.

He officially debuted in 2015, with the single [Angel 2 Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64vgmNlq84), featuring Filipino-American singer Jeff Bernat.

I cant really find too much else about him, but it seems he hasnt had a proper comeback since 2015. His last single was the song [Month of June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krHshoFGpf4)"".

His Makestar was slated to end February 7, but got an extension until the 28th.


**[Jang Moonbok 1st Mini Album Celebration Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_jangmoonbok/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 5, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Jang Moonbok needs no introduction, but Ill give the short version.

Moonbok rose to prominence in 2010 after his horrendous audition on SuperstarK2 when he was 15. Unfortunately, instead of becoming a good-humored meme, Moonbok got extremely bullied and harassed both in person and online. It got so bad that he had severe depression and contemplated suicide. However, after a period of time, he decided to battle against these negative feelings and instead worked to get healthy, be better at his craft, and to not let his detractors bother him anymore.

One of the things he did was reclaim the meme nickname Hip-Hop President title that people nicknamed him with after his audition, while also releasing [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxKCOWPpBU) prior to his stint on PD101. People praised him for his improvement and tenacity while some even apologized for their mean spirited comments in the past.

Moonbok auditioned for the second season of PD101, and placed #27 in the final competition. His most notable performance was as a member of Boys Under the Moon, who performed [I Know You Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W__ugoS3-lc).


**[Heyne Single Album Project Part 2](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_heyne_02/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 8, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Heyne?

Heyne is a soloist originally signed to Crescendo Music, but is currently at Wellmade Yedang
 (yes, thats actually the labels name).

She debuted in 2013 with the single [Dalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kdzuul6nTA) and her last album *Love Cell* was funded via Makestar (though the page oddly seems to no longer exist on the site). 

According to her Makestar, she has also dabbled in MCing and acting, with a few of her notable activities including MCing Suspicous Show and acting in JTBCs Seonam Girls High School Investigators.


**[AOORA Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_aoora/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 8, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is AOORA?

AOORA is a soloist who is former member of AA (pronounced double A) and is singed to Wellmade Yedang. He debuted in AA with the song  [So Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vXFefnd9x4)"" in 2011. During his time with AA, he also was in a subunit with member Hoik, simply known as AOORA&amp;HOIK. They released the song ""[   (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQxekY0rWqU)"" feat. Taeyeon of the girl group shez. He left AA in 2016 to pursue a solo career.

Hes a rapper and singer, who (I guess) has a reputation for making 19+ solo tracks, has a very active [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/channelAOORA) where he posts new tracks and covers.


**[Gunmin and Heedo Unit Album Project]( https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_big_03/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 28, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Gunmin and Heedo are two members of the k-pop group B.I.G, who have run [two](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_bigfanmeeting/) [previously](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_big/) successful Makestars in the past.

Gunmin and Heedo make up the groups first subunit.

A little bit about B.I.G (which stands for Boys in Groove), they are is a five member group signed to GH Entertainment. The group debuted in 2014 with the song [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp2emtZWc_k). According to the interwebs, Gunmin and Heedo trained at the Plug In Music Academy prior to joining B.I.G.  B.I.G didnt start getting more notice until their single [1.2.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MKp9dtH3eI), which was released without Minpyo (who was taking a break due to health issues at the time).

Gunmin and Heedo both auditioned for *The Unit*, performing a remix of Usher, Lil Jon, and Ludacris ""[Yeah!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5gGRvOkWKs)"". Heedo initially was the only member to pass the judges' votes after the duo failed to get a superboot, but Gunmin was eventually called back to join the show. Gunmin placed 33rd in the competition, while Heedo placed 28th.

Gunmins most notable performance was as part of Team Black in Unit B, which was a [mashup performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiS5uxrAjRM) of Stay by Zedd and Alessia Cara and Chained Up by Vixx. Heedos most notable performance was in Team White of Unit B, which performed the original song [My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL3wsFcU7Ts).

**[The Rose Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose_02/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. Also a relatively new group, they debuted on August 3 with the single [Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

The group previously ran a successful Makerstar for their previous [single album](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose/). They grossed 618% over their initial goal.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

They have an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bandtherose/).


**[Blah Blah 2nd Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_blahblah/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 3, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Blah Blah?

Blah Blah is a five member girl group signed to FAB Entertainment.

The group debuted on November 22, 2017 with the single [Good Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJARCe-5MnI).

Not too much else has been written about them besides the standard idol stats, but rapper Yuri was previously a member of SIDA under the name Yoori.

The groups main concept seems to a mixture of  innocence and sexiness (as stated via their makestar page), and their fandom name is Blahsome.

The group has an active [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWPh0P7Fqg2x78Si1uZ_LQ) page though.

**[A-yeon First Solo Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ayeon_01//)**

* Date Project Ends: March 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is A-yeon?

Not to be confused with JYPs Baek A-yeon, this A-yeon is a female drummer who is a member of the Korean girl band Bebop, which has been active since 2013.

Not much has been written about the group in English, but the group is signed to Loen Entertainment. While Im not certain, the groups debut single was [I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ_f0MiDx6c), although they featured on Hummingbird Urban Stereos track [Maem Maem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-sDFUXskgU)"" a year prior.

The group has an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bebopofficial/), while A-yeon also have an active [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdld7SHk9IyYSkNrHA9B6Dw) channel where she posts her drum covers.



**[S.I.S Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is S.I.S?

So there actually isnt too much written about them in English, but [relevant wikia](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/S.I.S) page.

From what little I could gleam from the internet, S.I.S (which stands for Serendipity in Stars) is a six member girl group signed to XX Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Ive Got a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwx68Z99uk)"". According to their Makestar, the groups image is going for a little sister vibe. They do have a pretty active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sis6girls/) page.

The group auditioned on *The Unit* with a performance of GFriend's ""[Glass Bead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cng6NnsntK0)"", though only 3 members (Anne, Gauel, and Sebin) made it past the audition rounds. Anne eventually placed 22nd, Gaeul placed 39th, and Sebin placed 56th in the competition.

The project was initially slated to end December 28, 2017, but got an extension by Makestar to run until February 19. This is the projects second extension.


**[MONT Mini-Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mont_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 18, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is MONT?

MONT is a three member boy group signed to FM Entertainment. They officially debuted on May 18 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-aXAJR60Y)"". According to their official thread on OneHallyu, the group was initially intended to be five members, releasing 1 single as 3 members, then another with 4, and then the final single as 5 before officially debuting. However, the information is unsourced and with the release of this Makestar, it seems that the group will only have three members.

Their fandom name is MINT.

The group became popularly known due to their audition on the YG show *MIXNINE* due to having their label be situated in the middle of the woods in the country (and due to their CEO stating she used to sell kimbap). The group gave a [very polished audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9kFEv-Wbs) that impressed YG and passed all 3 MONT boys.

The boys did relatively decent while on the show if you take into account no one had heard of them prior to MIXNINE. All three were eventually eliminated prior to the finals, with Sangyeon (Bitsaeon) and Joongmin (Roda) being eliminated during the 1st round of cuts and Hyunwoo (Narachan) being cut during the second round of eliminations.

They have an active [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/montlove1/) and [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/montlove1/) as well.

But I'm a Shawol and SHINee's official fan color is actually a big part of the fandom culture lol. Their color is ""pearl aqua"" and I feel like SHINee incorporates it a lot. Their merch always has that color and the members have worn aqua colored outfits when performing. Some fans will buy something just because it was ""SHINee color."" And we all paint our nails aqua lol. Here are some examples of SHINee and their fan color: https://imgur.com/a/Hk7UI

Lots of groups these days don't care about having an official color, but do any of your favorite groups use their color a lot? Or can you think of any interesting examples of a groups color being used?

Honestly I think ASTRO could pull it off. I mean they pulled off all the seasons concept well so I could see them doing a similar concept to a release every month and releasing 2 full albums within the year. Starts off fun and random and then towards the end maybe some kind of story plot (love triangle like with Wonpil who likes Sungjin who likes girl who likes Brian who likes Dowoon and then ends off on maybe something christmasy) I can totally see that with ASTRO. Or maybe a for another group a whole 12 month storyline every month the plot deepens and then December's MV would be the ending to the story, but I feel like that would be more suited with like BTS or INFINITE or a group who isnt too cutesy. I loved the triologies the past years like with BTS I Need U/Run/Forever Young VIXX's Greek Mythology trilogy, MONSTA X's The Clan trilogy even DAY6's love triangle story that I mentioned. It's only the beginning of the year so I truly hope a group takes on something like that, it would be nice to see",22,46

Would you add any fanmade merch to your collections? Or would you guys solely prefer the official merch?

I've encountered a few fanmade merch that are very pretty. They were really well made that some of my friends even thought they were a limited edition of official merch. 

I would definitely be happy if I were able to encounter more pretty fanmade merch. I don't think they would effect the sales of official merch, as they are totally different designs all together.",18,6

But we know that as the road goes on, they start releasing songs that are much better bops than their debut title. 
So the question is: Out of all of the songs the group has released so far, which one would you choose as their debut so they could've had a much better, successful debut?

For me, I know that 'Happiness' was probably a half-assed song by SM to get Red Velvet out to cover the Exo shenanigans, as well as just doing whatever because Yeri hasn't been added yet, but imagine having the Automatic / Ice Cream Cake era as their debut. That'd be epic.

They're doing good now anyways, so not that it matters...",86,35

She had also recently made her solo debut

1671,2018-02-22,2018,2,22,20,7zec0x,Fan Account: My minute with Dreamcatcher in Amsterdam,luperizer,1519300135,"Hi everyone! I recently went to Dreamcatchers concert and signing session in Amsterdam and I wanted to share my experience with you guys. Im a Korean guy living in the Netherlands and I can speak Korean fluently, so I actually managed to have a decent conversation with them. It still feels like a dream, and in a desperate attempt to engrave all these beautiful memories into my mind, Ill write down every detail I can remember.

I think roughly 200 people showed up for the signing session. We were all standing outside in the freezing cold for hours until they finally started letting people in in order of their wristband numbers. As we entered the room, we were each handed a poster for them to sign. I noticed the people in front of me were all coming back out incredibly quickly, so I mentally prepared myself to absorb everything in the short amount of time that we were given.

When I stepped into the room, I looked around the corner and the first member I saw was Dami, and I just couldnt believe how beautiful she is. Shes already gorgeous on camera, but believe me when I say that shes even more so in real life. I could only catch glimpses of the rest, as they were blocked off by fans.

Finally it was my turn.
___
**SuA:** As I stepped in front of SuA, I said ! **(Annyeonghaseyo!)**. At first she said Hello~ in English, but half a second later she had a surprised look on her face as she asked ? ? **(Oh, are you Korean?)**.

I immediately replied ! .  . **(Yes! Im Korean. My name is Yoobin)**.

To which she responded with a very happily surprised look and said ! ?   ! **(Wow! Really? You have the same name as Dami!)**. For those of you who dont know, Damis real name is Yoobin.

I couldnt even say bye to SuA as I was quickly shuffled forwards to the next member, but she waved goodbye. Sua maintained eye contact throughout this entire exchange and was just stunning from start to finish.
___
**Handong:** At this point my mind was slowly turning into a blank slate and starting to forget everything I wanted to say to them. Handong casually greeted me with a sweet Hello~.

The first thing I blurted out to Handong was  !        **(Youre so pretty! I think my hearts going to stop T__T)**.

She brushed her hair behind her ear looked up slightly and replied with a shy  \^\^ **(Thank you \^\^)**, to which I almost died on the spot.
___
**Siyeon:** Siyeon quickly caught onto the fact that I could speak Korean and greeted me with ~ **(Annyeonghaseyo~)**.

I replied with !  ! **(Hi! Im a huge fan!)** I was clutching at my heart at this point.

She said     \^\^ **(Thank you for coming to see us \^\^)**.

I replied !      **(No, thank YOU for coming here T__T)**
___
**Jiu:** Jiu smiled as she asked ! ? **(Wow! Youre Korean?)**

I replied  ! ,     ! **(Yes, thats right! Oh, and I saw you performing at ISAC!)**

Her face lit up as she said  ? :D **(Oh really? :D)**

!   ! **(Yeah! I cheered for you from home!)**

She flashed the brightest smile in the universe, gave me two thumbs up and said  ! **(Oppa, youre the best!)**. She maintained eye contact, continued smiling and did cutest little thumbs up shoulder dance as I moved on. I will never forget this for the rest of my life.
___
**Yoohyeon, Gahyeon, Dami:** At this point, the people ahead of me were all done, so I was essentially talking to 3 members at once. Yoohyeon greeted me cheerfully and said   ! ~ **(Oh, youre really Korean! Hello~)**.

I replied , !    .      . **(Yes, hi! Youre all so pretty T__T. Im a fan currently living in the Netherlands and my name is Yoobin.)**

Gahyeon took a very surprised look on her face, turned to Dami and put a hand on her shoulder to grab her attention and said ! ,   ! **(Wow! Unnie, oppas name is Yoobin!)**. Dami smiled as she said  ? **(Wow, really?)** and she gave me the cutest little applause.

Yoohyeon asked  ? **(Are you here as an exchange student?)**.

I replied ,     18 . **(No, its been 18 years since I started living in the Netherlands.)**

All three of them went ~ (Oh~) as they looked at each other, as if I was somehow cool for living in a foreign country.

Gahyeon, being the adorable maknae that she is, wrote [To.  &lt;3 **\(To. Yoobin Oppa &lt;3\)** on my poster](https://i.imgur.com/9qtw3ax.jpg). [**YOOBIN OPPA.** OH MY GOD. MY HEART.](https://i.imgur.com/tc9jQ3M.jpg) There arent enough words in the English language to describe how that makes me feel.

Yoohyeon and Gahyeon waved goodbye at the same time. Those eye smiles melted me.

Finally I was left with Dami. I jokingly said    ~ **(Yoobin-ssi, your name is so pretty~)**. She shyly replied  \^\^ **(You too Oppa \^\^)**.

As I walked away I said ! **(Hwaiting!)** Dami said the same with a cute little fist pump gesture.
___
Thanks to whoever actually read all of this. It seems long when written out, but all of this went by in the blink of an eye. I stumbled all over my words, couldnt say everything I wanted to, and was left with so many thoughts of what I wouldve done if I could do it again. Im sure Ill get another chance in the future!

All the members were absolutely breathtaking, incredibly polite and friendly. If any of you have a chance to meet them, I strongly suggest you do. Trust me, you will have no regrets whatsoever.

1701,2018-02-23,2018,2,23,1,7zg33y,K-Pop from an Equity Investments Perspective,balloon_wanted,1519316550,"I came across this Equity Research Analysis with regards to the Idol Industry published by Hana Financial Group. The analysis focuses on the industry more as to why these groups are successful (what marketing tactics they have done correctly) and which companies and groups are worthwhile in investing rather than focusing on the quality of music and members.


Translated parts of the analysis from the first 25 pages. Most of the content not included are tables and graphs more difficult to re-produce as well as the summary prospectus for each of the four companies (page 26 to end). I have mainly focused on the overall picture, though there is also a focus on BTS and their success, however most of the information provided is already known.

If there are parts of the document that are not translated and do not involve graphs, I would be more than happy to follow up with a translation and also clarify any parts that may have been unclear in interpretation.

There are quite a few choreos where groups have creative transitions or formations and it really adds to the whole performance imo. For example there's this [transition](https://youtu.be/nVCubhQ454c?t=1m57s) in SNSD Lionheart which is really cool as they change positions staying in a line and so effortlessly include Sunny as they finish up the change. There's also the transition in [SNSD Holiday](https://youtu.be/YwN-CN9EjTg?t=1m35s) where the camera moves with them as they rotate their formation which is a really clever use of the camera and the traditional V and line formations. CLC Black Dress is more of a [song and dance transition](https://youtu.be/hF6Wds75rjg?t=1m7s) because of how it goes from Seungyeon dance solo to group pose to Yeeun rap but really highlights the members talents, The song in general is really good at that but I especially adore that part.

I also noticed some really cool formations in Oh My Girl's [Love O'clock](https://youtu.be/k0dnQyImq_k) The head bobbing with the tick tock sound at the start and the opening of their arms which they repeat at the end but closing their arms instead. The head bobbing that Jiho, Arin and Hyojung do as they move around at Binnie's every minute like ~0:56 and the flying formation they do around Seunghee's high note ~3:10 it really adds to the clock concept and the flying formation makes the high note even more beautiful.

So what are your favourite ones and why?",111,156

* Dasoni (Hani X Solji from EXID) - They had one EP and [one MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpMScAlOzHo), Since then they have had other collabs for a [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrlrKR56j4w) or [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOxQ6oR21ak) but I wish they would release something else under Dasoni. I love their voices together and another album or MV together when Solji is feeling better would be awesome.

* GD X TAEYANG (Big Bang) - Of course they have been [featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuuiBjL09KY) on [each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6C2geiH0SQ) other's [solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9EYUmqVzY) albums but still I want to see them promote and have another MV together. [Good Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZRb1we80kM) is as much of a banger today as it was when it was released. Now we will have to wait at least 2 years for another subunit song. T_T

* Bom Hi (Park Bom from 2NE1 and Lee Hi) - These girls only released [ONE song together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvI89r8Tt9s) and it was a Christmas song at that. I still love it but I can only listen to it once a year and their voices together is heaven. I'm so salty YGE didn't give them another opportunity. Now with Bom in ~the dungeon~ hiding, I don't have much hope for another collab.",141,128

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
for the sake of time, 
2. I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation. 

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P

1815,2018-02-24,2018,2,24,12,7ztxg8,Girl Groups and Producing Music,Aquamaraqua,1519442477,"Main question: how do we get more female idols to be able to put out music they  have produced? 

I feel like there's so much always talked about girl groups on forums and social media for a few years now in terms of support and concepts, and a lot of it comes down to the shift of girl groups that happened from the 2nd gen girl group era to the 3rd gen era.

 

Personally I don't find girl groups of the 3rd gen very appealing, and the whole ""meninist"" term being thrown around for anyone that doesn't stan a girl group that isn't Blackpink or Mamamoo gets tiring--let people like who they like without labeling them.

 

A huge misconception is that girl groups are hated on by boy group fans, and that boy group fans only care about ""girl crush"" concepts (which is partly true).

 

While yes, I'm sure there are some bg fans that hate on girl groups, it's definitely not the major demographic that cares about girl groups enough to hate on them... because that has proven to be time and time again to be fans of girl groups themselves. Or at least the male demographic (who tend not to be boy group fans). [Case 1](https://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2017/04/dia-unveils-their-two-new-members-at.html). [Case 2](https://onehallyu.com/topic/527601-new-fantagio-girl-group-introduces-final-four-members-ahead-of-debut/). And there's more where that came from. It's always about pitting women against women... tell me how many ""whose the best visual"" threads you get comparing male idols vs. female idols. I've seen way more for women across various forums...

 

Onto the point of boy group fans (who tend to be girls) only liking ""girl crush"" concepts. While that may be true because of the prevalence of the diametric innocent or girl crush concepts in the 3rd gen, it's a lot more than what is just observed. People have a tendency to want something they can relate to and feel empowered by. While many innocent concepts may be received well by a younger female audience, generally speaking as you get older you tend to like more mature concepts that you may subconsciously want to emulate an essence from. I'll also use this opportunity to bring up the ""cute concept"" hate. It's not /cute/ things people necessarily hate, it's the fetishizing of youth and infantilizing women that many people don't find as attractive. Take a group of high school girls like Busters dancing in high school appropriate clothing vs. obviously older women dressed to seem ""innocent"" and pure to basically sell sex (see Korean army performances). And as for cute concepts, if it's quirky or cute like Orange Caramel/Momoland, it doesn't matter your gender or age, anyone can enjoy that, especially since OC aren't trying to give off the impression of being pure, they're just being cute while having fun and owning their own personas.

 

I digress though. Back to only liking girl crush concepts... it doesn't have to be badass, it could be sexy, it could be chic, it could be wearing a potato sack, whatever. It's evident when you look at the fanbases of 2nd gen girl groups like KARA, 2NE1, f(x) , After School etc. that badass isn't all ""boy group stans"" (code word for fangirls) want... all very different from one another, but all representing their own style of womenhood and all pulling off different concepts.

 

In the 3rd gen, save a few groups, I feel like there's a huge identity issue with girl groups (and boy groups, but moreso girl groups due to the way the industry is structured). They just don't know who they are, and companies don't know what to do with them either. I'm hoping girl groups will be able to find who they are and what they do best, like Momoland, but it gets difficult especially with groups that are large and have varying opinions.

 

It's the idol world and isn't really all that deep, I get that, but there's a lot of negativity within the fandom which wouldn't exist I feel if companies took a more organic approach with their idols.

 

The biggest thing for me is the lack of female idols producing music. While producing your own music doesn't necessarily mean you will always form your own identity, it is a push in the right direction to distinguish yourself. I know not all male idol groups produce their own music, but the producer ratio is terribly biased toward male idols. You've got Jinyoung, GD, Zico, Jooheon, heck even rookie boy groups are allowed to produce their own work these days. And then on the female side... LE and BEG. Seriously... where is everybody else? It's no secret female idols have been denied from producing music they wanted to in the past (see Hyorin, 2NE1 as a whole), and the treatment of female idols is really poor, even compared to their male counterparts. These are the sort of sexist attitudes girl group stans should be talking about instead of dragging boy groups stans every chance they get on Twitter...

 

I just want to see more women doing whatever the hell they want to in the K-Pop sphere. Even soloists in K-Pop are lacking divas. The last real diva we had was Lee Hyori and she's a generation old. I guess Chungha comes the closest for this generation? Regardless, we need more women to hone their skills.

 

TL;DR Let the women produce, K-Pop companies...",51,0

What is this?

&gt; Inspired by u/Galyndean's Hanteo sale compilations, this is an attempt to record digital performance of Korean songs released in 2018.

But Gaon doesnt record sales anymore?

&gt; Yes. But they have a heat index in place that give us an indication of how songs are performing digitally.

Why am I doing this?

&gt; I like charts. Ever since I started following them last year, I noticed that we, as ifans, often don't discuss and are clueless about what's *actually* charting in Korea - a lot of the times its actually not kpop. I'm hoping that these compilations both let us know how our faves are doing and introduce us to non-kpop music via their charting status.

&gt; Overall, its an attempt to keep track of it all so that we can observe and discuss trends in Korean music, make judgments about the way our faves are doing and hopefully discover new non-kpop music that's charting well.

How this is going to go? (open to suggestions)

&gt; I'm actually not too sure. Currently, I have made some vague guidelines for myself. Here they are:

&gt; * I will record the heat index score for songs every week on the excel sheet I have linked. Then I will make a graph out of them so that its more ~interesting~ or whatever. No, its actually because graphs reveal more about the song's growth and performance over weeks. Its cool stuff.

&gt; * **Only songs released in 2018 will be considered** to be recorded on this excel sheet. Pre-2018 Gaon system has sales, not heat index and there's no way to convert.

&gt; * **Only notable songs' performances will be recorded.** Way too many songs release for me to record them all. Judging how a song is notable is a bit vague but for now my method is observing the ranking on Gaon's Digital Chart every week and compare with the song's charting on Melon/iChart. If a song is consistently in top 10 in Melon, iChart, Gaon's Digital Chart for 3-4 weeks then I consider it notable. I'll figure it out along the way, I hope.

&gt; * In these posts, I will post a table that tracks the cumulative points for all these releases. They will be sorted by points.

**Other noteworthy stuff:**

* A problem I'm facing and would like you guys' suggestions on: if I limit myself to *just* notable releases, it leaves most idol groups out. Would you like me to make exceptions and record some idol releases too? I will note their cumulative sales in the table I post here instead of including them in the excel sheet but it'll give you guys an idea. OR there can be a separate excel sheet that I'll update only idol releases in and you can access that for just idol releases. The table on here can just be the top ten cumulative points. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

* Another problem is that currently, there are a lot of pre-2018 and non-Korean releases charting really, really well and it'll make it to Gaon's year end charts for sure. I would like to record them to give you guys a picture of other notable releases that are massively loved. Currently, my idea is to note exceptional pre-2018 and non-Korean releases in a separate table on here to make note of it somewhere but I will not my keeping track of their points or anything on here - just note them and their rank. But I'm open to suggestions.

____________

This is the very first post. I'd really appreciate you guys' feedback and changes you want to see here. Also, lmk if these posts should be made bi-weekly/monthly and whether you want me to include all idol songs or even if you want me to include pre-2018 releases or something. Open to listen to everything. Thanks.",6,25
1869,2018-02-25,2018,2,25,0,7zxean,What are some of your favorite pre-choruses in K-Pop?,Fakayana,1519487650,"[Pre-choruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_structure) are simply the part leading up to the chorus, but quite distinct from the regular verses. You can tell them apart since they're often quite different melodically, and they're *usually* shorter than the verse.

I love pre-choruses since they're usually a bit more experimental than the rest of the song, I guess? Like while the verse are what hooks you into the song and the chorus the part where you can't resist singing along, pre-choruses can be anything they want lol. They can really spice up the song.

Here's a few examples. I put the timestamp on just so it's easier to find, you should still listen from the beginning since the point of the pre-chorus is to bridge the verse and chorus (same goes for the other examples in the comments).

- Oh My Girl's [""Liar Liar""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNZKqhXCv5c)  (at 0:43). Those descending notes is just so great I don't know why.
- Red Velvet's [""Happily Ever After""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJr4wYRL9Kc) (at 0:38). With how busy and chaotic (in a good way!) the instrumentals on the rest of the song are, I really like how soothing the pre-chorus compared to the rest of the song. It makes for a really awesome transition when it goes back into full-gear on the chorus.",84,91
1870,2018-02-25,2018,2,25,0,7zxfim,Kpop Numbers Thread - Hanteo Sales - 180224,Galyndean,1519487985,"This is a wrap up through the end of January, so if you're looking at twitter the past couple weeks, you likely have more accurate numbers.

I've got direct access to Hanteo Charts now (yay), so at least for the time being, I should be able to get out a monthly chart.  I may or may not be able to continue with that depending on how much it costs when the international site goes out of beta.  We'll see.

As a warning, there are some kinks (Hanteo's international site doesn't have a native english button yet), so if an album title seems written weirdly (for instance, it's like be BTS is Bang Bang Boys) or a release date is wrong, give me a heads up in the comments.

Enough talking, time for numbers!  (Sales over 5K only).

You know what to do. Leave your review as a reply to the comment with the song title. Say whatever you feel like saying, so long as you are 100% respectful of the artists  you are reviewing a song, not the persons who sang it. Along with your review, please leave a score between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you (optionally) review the music video as well. Feel free to review all seven songs or only one, whatever you choose! 

As a reminder, I usually dont pick the songs that appear on Jukebox! This week since its a) the 24th, and b) the 24th Jukebox, I picked three songs to commemorate that. Hope you dont mind! The other four were all randomly chosen, I really didnt pick them (although funny how 24K ended up being picked ahaha). The rest were randomly picked though! And, next week, none of them are gonna be randomly picked  all of them submitted by you! More on that in the Other Business section in the comments below. You have until this Friday at 8:00 PM PST to submit your reviews.

Turns out EXO's masterpiece is a bit of a hassle to record. We've had tons of requests for extensions, and even try-hards like myself were unable to finish a single recording. Because of this (and since our production team is still working on the instrumental), we're going to keeping the submissions open until **MARCH 24th**, because go big or go home amiright?

If you need a refresher of what the heck this is about, check out the official submission post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7vqbu9/rkpop_sings_second_digital_single_song_results/).

The last time I posted this discussion was 10 months ago and the last two times were fun so I thought it might be fun to have another. 

The way it goes is basically:

Post an opinion/view you have regarding kpop and people play devils advocate and reply with counter arguments.

Nothing is necessarily meant to change your view, but they lead to interesting discussions and it's healthy to sometimes look at things from another view point.

Try and refrain from writing stuff like ""my favourite xyz is.."".

I missed Ft. Island in October and I still regret it, so I promised myself to try and see every group that comes to Budapest, to support Europe concerts. When The Rose announced their tour I was so excited, because I really liked their debut, Sorry, and I even tried to convince my flatmate to come with me, but in the end she didn't. But fortunately I didn't have to go alone, because u/allmyfrensarealiens took me up on my offer I made in the announcment thread about going together. They had VIP, so we were supposed to go there for the start of the numbering, then go eat or something, but because I have the worst luck with organization none of that happened. 

**my bad luck with organization**

The organizers said that they will start numbering at 16:00, and after everybody can go, and come back by 18:30 when they will open the doors, and concert will start at 19:30. Now, I don't know what went wrong (and honestly, I don't really care), but in the end, they started letting in the VIPs first (so we got separated), but they didn't do anything about GA, and we spent almost 3 hours lining up in the -5C weather. It wasn't nice. Thinking back, I should have just gone home and come back to door opening, but they didn't tell us anything until it was too late to go home anyway, and I was hoping I can catch my new friend inside (didn't happen either). At least the [wristband](https://imgur.com/Tl4sSni) is one of the prettiest I've ever got 

**the concert (talks &amp; fluff)**

I was giving myself a crash course on the boys the week before the concert, but I didn't manage to pick a bias, because they seemed equally talented and funny and beautiful. They are all that in person as well, but after the concert I have to say that my boy Jaehyung really got to me. He was so adorable speaking so much Hungarian! He was always saying *ksznm* (thank you), he learned *sziasztok* (hello) but my favorite was *szpek vagytok* (you are beautiful). The man knows what to say, and he and Sammy are such flirts, it's not even funny, these men can wink.  Sammy said, that to him, Hungarian sounds like a mix of Spanish and English (what even). Sammy was trying to talk in English most of the time, but there was a Korean-Hungarian translator, so the boys (especially Dojoon) mostly talked in Korean. There were quite a few people who didn't speak Hungarian around me, so I tried to translate to them everything, but it was hard bc of the excessive screaming. 

Sammy's actual birthday was yesterday, so the members prepared a cake and we sang Happy birthday in Korean together to him. He said that this was the best birthday he had, because he got to spend it with us, fans. They thanked us for making it possible to them to tour Europe, and said that they want to come back. I think they mentioned about preparing a mini album after the tour ends (but I didn't hear it right). 

**the concert (setlist &amp; music)**

Because they only have two songs, they mostly played covers, and I have to admint I didn't recognize everything, but it was a mix of Korean and English songs. The ones I remember: Thining out loud by Ed Sheeran, Marry You by Bruno Mars, Viva la Vida by Coldplay, Breakeven by The Script, Scars by James Bay. Hajoon and Woosung preformed Dean's Say something, and Jaehyung and Hajoon did Missing you by 2NE1. 

BUT

I knew they did a cover of Last Dance by Bigbang. I knew it. But I wasn't expecting it at all. They sing it beautifully, it totally does justice to the original. And I was crying so much. I just really felt grateful that I got to hear this song live, and because Jiyong is enlisting tomorrow, it was super emotional for me. I tried to make a fancam, but you can hear my ugly sobbing. One of the girls next to me even asked if I was okay. Another one asked that ""this is from G-Dragon, right? Is it his song?"" and then noticed I was bawling and handed me a tissue. Kpop fans are so nice.

of course they played Like we used to and Sorry, and the crowd was really great. We had [banners](https://imgur.com/ujstpD6) for Sorry, and after they boys said that they won't forget us either. 

The only bad thing is, that is was really short, only one and a half our.

**post concert &amp; overall feelings**

I actually managed to find /u/allmyfrensarealiens after the concert! They promised they would give the [rose I crocheted](https://imgur.com/iCjsXhX) to Jaehyung (I'm still waiting on an update on wheter it was successful or they had to put it with the rest of the fan stuff). They are so nice, and I'm happy I got to meet them.

All in all, I really enjoyed the concert, the boys were great, and even more beautiful in real life. But I'm starting to lose hope in the organization of these event, because after the fail that was Live Nation, now My Music Taste also fucked up and my toes aren't happy.",6,14

There are Idols that are not very good at being idols. Most Idols fall in the middle-tier of in the area of alright to good. But there are some, a very select few, who are made to be Idols. They are on another level compared to most other Idols. Their talent is no joe, but where they really excel is their stage presence and their complete and utter domination of Idol life. You can see that every early morning and every late night, every single promotion cycle, they are always energetic and absolutely loving what they do. A group is lucky to have one of these members and in some cases they might even have two. 

So I just want to know who everyone thinks these idols are. For me, I think Seungyeon from CLC can fit into this category. Also I think both Amber and Luna from f(x) fit into it as well. The three of them just have the feeling that they were meant to be Idols. So what do you think?",120,80

Now that sort of sentiment has always bugged me because, to me, that doesn't mean they like KPop (as in the actual thing of Korean pop music), but rather the idol industry itself (~~and how it basically turns fans into stalkers who think not having 24/7 access to their favs is barbaric~~... &gt;.&gt;). Of course, that doesn't mean they don't like KPop, just that it's more about the access than the music (which is exactly what the idol industry is all about - ie selling *the idols*).

So, I'm curious: if the Korean idol industry still put out exactly the same music at the same quality etc etc but the ""access"" to the artists was similar to that of American pop stars (ie no music shows, fancams only from concerts, basically no fan photos, appearances limited to things like talk shows and radio shows, they'd still use SNS but nothing special like VLive or YouTube videos, etc etc), would you still be as in love with it as you are now?

I suppose the tl;dr would be: is it about the music (Korean pop) for you or the idols (access to your favs)?

2195,2018-02-28,2018,2,28,11,80si4h,What is a quote or something a member wrote that stood out to you?,AZUR3WRATH,1519785200,"A few weeks ago, there was a pretty neat discussion on [fave quotes from *leaders* of a group](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7wavbd/brag_about_your_leader_what_is_a_quote_or/). This time, what are some of your favorite quotes or comments of your bias, or any just any member in a group? No limitations this time and can be very any reason.

For me my favorite idol was/is SISTAR Dasom, and some of my favorite quotes that made me feel good are her putting people in their place online (so it's not really by word of mouth):

SISTAR were having a live Q&amp;A on Facebook where someone commented ""ching chong ching chong,"" followed by ""just kidding."" Dasom replied with [""so mean""](https://imgur.com/a/nvGOq) lol.

On Instagram someone kept telling her that she was ugly &amp; that she can't sing.. To which she replied with 

&gt; [""I wonder why you are so rude. Your opinion is not important. This is my Instagram right? can you stop?](https://imgur.com/a/2RwlM)

Again on Instagram.. someone messaged her saying some obscene stuff apparently. She replied back &amp; revealed what she responded with

&gt; [""What a pathetic life...just how hurt you must be to send a message like this. I'll pray for you. For your wretched life.""](https://imgur.com/a/i6olg)

On a serious note, some things said towards these idols are terrible. There's more that she said in the last one that is sad.

On the other side, for something warming, she wrote and signed [this to a fans'](https://imgur.com/a/9t7D3) Shake It album. It apparently translates to

&gt; ""Although the scale of our fans looks smaller than others', they are definitely stronger."" [credit: [All For Som (@BaiduDasomBar)](https://twitter.com/BaiduHyoLynBar/status/722443643768803330)]

Sistar members have always been aware of their fandom size. I mentioned this in the other discussion, but it still feels weirdly satisfying to know I've been apart of a fandom that wasn't huge, and the members recognize that, yet the group still managed to become incredibly successful with other top groups.
