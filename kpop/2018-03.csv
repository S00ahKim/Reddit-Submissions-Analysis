&amp;nbsp;

#### Group Shows

It seems like there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of group shows being posted to the subreddit, so we wanted to find out if you guys are okay with that or if you think there are too many?  If you think it's fine the way it is, let us know.  If you want to cut down on the number of episodes being posted, there are a couple options we could consider.  The first is that only the first episode of each new show could be posted.  That way you would know when a new show starts, but it would be up to you to follow or subscribe to get the new episodes.  We could also set a minimum time length on shows of perhaps 10 minutes per episode.  This would eliminate short daily shows but still keep longer weekly-type shows.  We could also do both, i.e., ""First episode or episodes longer than 10 minutes only.""  Let us know how you feel about these shows and if you have other ideas that might work better.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Award Show Stages

As we look back on the end-of-year shows from 2017, we wanted to reconsider what stages we allow to be posted.  Right now, we only allow new songs to have their own post and all other stages are kept inside the master post and wiki page.  We have considered expanding this rule to include Collab Stages and Cover Stages as well.  Would you guys like to see those stages get their own post, or do you feel like it would be too many posts from one event?  It's difficult to predict how many such stages there will be for future events.  Some events might have less than five while others could have up to fifteen or more.  I think we all love direct links to live performances, but let us know if this sounds good or if it sounds like too much.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Former K-Pop Idols Revisited

We talked about former K-Pop idols who have left Korea back in the [May 2017 Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/68ld9h/town_hall_may_2017/), but we think it's time to talk about it again.  Do you guys still want to follow the career news, releases, rumors, etc. surrounding former idols like Kris Wu, Luhan, Meng Jia, etc.?  If so, for how long?  Forever?  Kris Wu especially seems to be trending upwards in the US music scene.  Do you feel like his news, events, and music are still relevant for r/kpop or should we put some kind of limit on these types of stories?  All of these things are pretty rare right now, but that could change quickly in the future, so we'd like to have some sort of plan in place to handle it.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Sunday KPOPPERS Crossposts

Hopefully you are all aware of our sister subreddit /r/kpoppers. It's a place for all sorts of fan-created content and more fun discussions that are typically not allowed on /r/kpop. For the past few weeks we've been crossposting one discussion to help /r/kpoppers gain some traction.  Are you guys still enjoying those posts and should they continue?  Do you have ideas on how we can make the Sunday Crossposts better?  

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Mods

[In case you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7yim03/welcome_new_mods/), we have added three new mods to the r/kpop mod team: /u/alleybetwixt, /u/dravvie, and /u/tuckyd.  They all hit the ground running and have been doing a great job.  We hope you'll make them feel welcome and not be too upset if some mistakes are made.  We're all working hard to make r/kpop the best subreddit it can be and we appreciate your support, ideas, and feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",112,56

**Translation**

&gt;Hello. This is Starship Entertainment.

&gt;On Thursday's(today) schedule on Mnet M Countdown, Exy had symptoms of a fever &amp; dizziness after the pre-recording stage. 
She had to be admited to a hospital. A check up is in progress.

&gt;For all the fans that waited for a long time for today's comeback stage or fansigning,
Exy wanted to stay together till the end, with her will and strength but, 
She couldn't attend today's scheduled live broadcast stage and fansigning. It would've been too hard / too much work.
To all the fans, we ask that you understand.

&gt;After a detailed checkup and seeing a doctor, she will recover and see fans with a healthy appearance. 
To all the fans, we are sorry to cause you to worry.

Thanks to **Bink Nasty** on WJSN Discord Server for the tip and full translation.",21,223

I'm writing an essay (for a class on the history of the English language) on Korean influence on English in the era of K-pop. Prior to what I'm calling the ""post-psy era"", Korean influence on English was minimal (ex. kimchi, taekwondo). Recently, I've noticed a lot of word borrowing on k-pop stan social media and when I watched BTS perform in LA I was blown away that so many people knew Korean words. My thesis is essentially that as k-pop grows in influence, so does Korea's soft power, and that will lead to English speakers borrowing far more words from Korean. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas, observations, or resources that might help me out. ",24,12

I'm reviews editor over at The 405, we're a UK based music and culture publication, if you're not familiar. As a fan of the genre I've covered it for the site for some time, and since I stepped in I've been hoping to make the site more K-pop friendly, before when I was solely a writer it was pretty much just me covering IU and Red Velvet and the like - it's something, but obviously such a tiny slice/my own biases. Now that I'm able to help decide the site's spin, I'd love to get some more folk involved!

So, I figured, what better place to find enthusiasm than Reddit's K-pop corner. For those of that are passionate about music to the point where we're writing about it in chats or sites like this anyway, it can be a blast having your thoughts go 'official'; getting on Metacritic, having an audience, articles you can show friends, etc, etc.

Beyond that, for me, the end goal is to make some inroads into the industry. I talk with PR for pretty much every other genre / the site gets advance copies for most albums, but K-pop is an elusive beast. The more we get known for covering/caring about the genre, I hope we can start doing interviews and such, the way the site already does for Western artists. Granted, might need to brush up on our Korean, eh? (But, naturally, plenty of singers know some English).

So! It is a freelance gig (not paid, though that could change eventually), don't join up for the riches,  just if it's something you'd enjoy. I personally spent a long time just writin' away before jumping into the editor role, and I always enjoyed converting my opinions into a well thought out argument/piece.

If you're interested but not sure/have questions, feel free to PM me or email me at chase@thefourohfive.com. If you want to join up, also email me, just with a writing sample. It can be about anything K-pop: review a favorite release of yours, do a hypothetical column on something, whatever!

PS- Personally, I'd love to get a piece up on this whole TS/Secret mess. 'Poison' was one of the songs that got me into the genre as a relative latecomer (that video, ugh, perfection), and have been bummed watching them linger without releases for years. Do tell if you have any thoughts (whether just opinions or knowledge) on the situation!",15,39

For starters, SNSD and f(x) have sadly been inactive(although not disbanded, so there's definitely possibility for a comeback). Another point is that SM has a bunch of girl trainees atm, who have been around for a good long while actually(may I add, Lami is adorable &lt;3 ): http://kprofiles.com/sm-rookies-members-profile/
Video of them performing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSC8otpFOFg

Yes there are guy SM trainees, but they all seem to be going into NCT bc of the whole ""multiple units"" concept. The five girls are the ones who aren't really going anywhere atm. With five members right now, they could probably debut sometime this year. I definitely would love to see a new SM girl group, although Red Velvet has given me more than my fill of that &lt;3 ",78,121

128,2018-3-2,2018,3,2,16,81cn2d,Who was the most unexpected Kpop fan you've encountered in real life?,markleenct1,1519976652,"Had you ever encountered someone (irl), who from their outlook, or just in general... just looked like they wouldn't like Kpop, but it turned out the opposite?

I know there's no such thing as a ""looks like they like Kpop"" look, but from my school demographic, I can usually pick out who would know/like Kpop and who wouldn't.
Mostly because those who does like Kpop at my school (at least from what I've noticed), are super lowkey and chill. You just can't see them being one of those who fools around, is super loud, etc. And the Kpop fans usually hangs in crowds where everyone likes Kpop too (and most of them are Asians xD).

So when I was in math class, casually taking out my binder that I've filled it with a bunch of Park Jihoon photos, I was surprised when one of my classmate, who hangs around with a bunch of class clowns (those too cool for you kind of group) said that she knows him (Jihoon) and that he was cute, I was a bit taken back. Also because she knew who Wanna One was (It's so hard to find someone who knows/likes Wanna One irl speaking internationally, let alone... even on this subreddit)",48,63

I've been on the Korea Times Music Festival (KTMF) line-up page since this morning because I was waiting for another artist announcement. I refreshed now (1:00 PM PST) and EXID is no longer in the line-up. There's also a disclaimer that says ""Depending on the shows preparations and situations, some artists are subject to change without any notice.""  

I also can't find it on their Facebook page anymore so I guess that was deleted too.

I was listening to a Girl Group spotify playlist and I liked the aegyo of the song so I kept it on. Then, the drop happened. That night, I watched every MV. Chuu had just came out 3 days earlier. The next day, I discovered the loonaverse. Ever since then, LOONA has replaced Red Velvet as my second favorite group and I just love them so much. 

Another would be the Dumb Dumb MV. The scene where Irene is getting into the car while Yeri is lifting her head is absolutely stunning. I remember being on my couch and eating cheesy fries when I actually dropped the fry and burnt my leg. Ive never seen a more beautiful MV scene and I doubt that I ever will. 

A moment for me thats not musically related is a variety show that I watched where Sojin of Girls Day was talking about how she always worries whenever Girls Day has a cute concept if she can pull it off. Her entire debut story is so sad but to have to continue to worry if youre doing well is just heartbreaking.

I didn't expect them to become so big, especially after Growl, i personally lost interest after Wolf and jumped on BTS whom at the time just debuted lol 

(Fan Fact: back in 2013 on Facebook many ""Exotics"" were talking about this newly debuted Kpop group and how one of the members looked like Kai, the group was BTS, the guy who apperently looked like Kai was Suga, i didn't saw any similarities and they sure don't look alike now lol but it was in that moment that i fell for BTS!)

Still, even if i don't follow them anymore or have interest, looking back at how much EXO achieved and still achieve i can't help but feel happy for them, they came a long way :D

For BTS, as i said i became an Army right at their debut, the struggle as a fan was real compared to EXO but that didn't stop me from supporting them, it's weird to think at how different things were back then and even more weird yet amazing how things can change so much, by 2014 tho, after Danger, i lost interest in their music and right from there they would have started to slowly blow up, as said, looking at them now i feel amazed by their success, that nugu super talented dorky group i spent my early teens spazz over wishing for the world to notice them finally did it and did even more than i could have ever imagined, it blows my mind and just like EXO i can't help but feel happy for them even though i'm not a fan anymore, they are the most popular groups, can i say in the world? Cause i want to see them take over the world haha, i expect both of these groups to own this year even more than the last years! :) 

Now are there any groups whos success amaze you and makes you feel genuinely happy for them? ",31,23

Hanteo is giving me only the most recent current month, which means mathing on my end (yay).  It also means that if I didn't grab last month's total, I just don't have it.

For albums that I was able to find January numbers for, I went ahead and updated with the current totals.  For albums that I wasn't, I put in a + sign, so that you know they sold more.. I just don't have the complete total.

For my own sanity, I'm trying to keep it to albums that sold over 5K in the month, but I know that there are a lot of groups (especially nugus) that you guys are interested in (and I don't follow every group out there to know who is or isn't releasing something and when).  If there is a group who had an album come out in **February** that isn't listed in the chart and you'd like me to see if there is a number available for them, please request in the comments with the group and album name.

Hope you enjoy the songs that are on this week!

But first, lets have a quick recap of last week! Artists featured included TWICE, EXO, Sunmi, and more! The highest ranked song of last week was **BoAs Every Heart** with a score of __8.79__! Congrats to one of the OG queens, BoA!

Alright yall, heres the songs that were submitted by you that I ended up picking! I read through all your responses, listened to every song you sent to me, and narrowed it down to these seven! Do you swear and promise to me mah baby? Do you love her? DO YOU LOVE HER? Cuz its all about you, you you you you! Yall like your brown eyes, white t-shirts, sugar-free songs, and beautiful things in general  here are this weeks songs!

1. [Brown Eyed Girls - Abracadabra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y)

7. [MV] [INFINITE - Lately (White Confession)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZu3fRDrK5c)

If I didnt choose your song  please dont think I didnt like it! I really enjoyed reading through all of your submissions. However, like I said last week, I really did want to prioritize artists who have never appeared on Jukebox or have only appeared once on Jukebox. I got a lot of submissions, and I really did try to have as much of a variety on Jukebox as I could. 

You know what to do! Leave your review as a reply to the comment with the song name and artist. Say whatever you want to say about the song, this is your time and space to leave your thoughts! Leave with your review a score between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can review the MV along with the song, although you are in no way required to! Totally optional. Feel free to review just one or all seven songs that are on this week. 

All songs this week were submitted by you and chosen by me from your submissions  so ultimately, chosen by you! Were back to your regular ol Jukeboxes next week, but dont worry  in the future, youll have the chance to submit songs once again!

273,2018-3-4,2018,3,4,9,81ueym,What are your favorite song endings?,FineAppleDice,1520124878,"Here are some that was very memorable for me even from 1st listen:

* [IU - Jam Jam:](https://youtu.be/2NH7avOIZvc?t=3m19s) IU getting disrupted like that was really unexpected and very intriguing .

* [WJSN - Dreams Come True:](https://youtu.be/IrircflFHzw?t=3m41s)The way they softened it to just vocals and strings was very catchy &amp; refreshing

* [OH MY GIRL - Secret Garden:](https://youtu.be/QIN5_tJRiyY?t=3m55s) I think this is one of the most striking endings that I've ever heard. The combination of the soaring voice &amp; a newly introduced dramatic segment  is just something that I find so captivating.

How a song ends is the most recent memory you'll have from listening to music. But they aren't usually the most memorable song component since other parts are made to be more intriguing to keep our attention
till such ending. It makes sense that we have frequent threads for other song components while song endings are rarely discussed. With this in mind what are some of your favorite kpop song endings and why?",122,151

My pick for a hit song that seems to have disappeared from public consciousness is 4minute's [What's Your Name?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-IJWqIHioA) It was [ranked 6th](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/01/gaon-chart-releases-yearly-digital-ranking-download-and-streaming-charts-for-2013) on the 2013 Gaon year-end chart and was one of the best-selling singles from an idol group, just below Sistar19's ""Gone Not Around Any Longer."" It also won a Digital Bonsang at Golden Disk Awards and garnered 7 music show wins. Idols danced along to it on variety shows. It was *everywhere*.

Fast forward a few years and the song doesn't even get covered or remotely referenced (unlike ""Hot Issue,"" which still gets covered by trainees). It's one of those songs where you look back and go, ""oh yeah, that was a thing."" In comparison, some other 2013 hit songs that were definitely not as successful as What's Your Name: Apink - Nonono, Shinee - Everybody, Dream Girl, IU - Red Shoes, Sistar - Give It To Me, f(x) - Rum Pum Pum Pum, 2NE1 - Missing You",218,226

So, I was talking to a lovely member here in r/kpop and noticed her flair had EXO and Lovelyz (absolutely adore both) and asked her why she stanned them, because Lovelyz is such a huge contrast from EXO's concepts and styles.


For me personally, I would argue that Oh My Girl is by far the most different from my top favourites: BTS, Red Velvet and EXO.

Their songs usually have more intensity, but I still think they pulled off the concept well. Most of the other groups I stan like SHINee, CLC and f(x) are known for their experimentalism, so it's hard for me to pinpoint a song or concept that was really out of their style; their whole concept revolves around them experimenting with different genres and different styles. I guess if I had to choose SHINee, I'd probably say SHINee World doo bop. Anyway, I'm curious to see what your thoughts are! Did you like the change in style, or do you prefer their normal style better? ",64,61

As an Indian myself, when I was younger I did have dreams of trying out for an agency and going into the industry. Obviously, I kind of realized it's not feasible, and so I gave that up. Years later, as a devoted fan, I am still curious- would the agencies be willing at all to take an Indian on as a trainee/have them eventually debut as an idol? Please don't take this as offensive/racist in any way, I don't mean it like that, just genuinely curious since I've never seen it.

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process. 

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection. 

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation.

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P",12,5

**If you read my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **5** brand new, unopened Marmello ""Wake Me Up"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

1.  What drew you or intrigued you about Marmello?

2.  Which did you prefer, Puppet or Cant Stop?

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I will leave the entries open for a week and draw the winners on 3/14.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.**

**Other Chartings:**

* Havana at No. 7 (down by 1 places)
* Hand Clap at No. 9 (up by 3 places)
* Heart Shaker at No. 16 (up by 1 place)
* Like It at No. 8

__________________

**Noteworthy stuff:**

* **Chungha's Roller Coaster** reached a new peak of No. 6 this week after 2 months of release.
* **H.O.T's 'Hope' and 'Full of Happiness'** entered the charts at No. 47 and No. 87 respectively thanks to their reunion on nation's TV program 'Infinite Challenge.'
* **   by 4MEN** released in 2017 climbed up 32 spots to place at No. 31 on this week's chart.
* Notice that of all the pre-2018 releases I'm noting: **Gift, Instagram, Good Old Days and Contrail** - Good Old Days and Gift are still holding up in high positions on TOP 10 every week with Contrail a bit behind the two and Instagram - which was actually released not too long before 2018 has started falling off. The other 3 will end up charting higher in year end charts than Instagram.
* **Bolbbalgan4's 'First Love'** dropped a bit severely in the long run. Nothing too crazy but not up to par with Bolbbalgan4's standards.
* Of **Sunmi** and **Chungha's** releases - Chungha has better longevity - in the long run, Roller Coaster will probably be ahead of Heroine which is dropping while Roller Coaster is increasing in points every week.
* **iKON's Love Scenario** and **Momoland's BBoom BBoom** have *high* possibilities of being the highest placing idol releases in the year end charts.
* **iKON's Love Scenario** has consistently had the most points for any song on the chart on a weekly and monthly basis. The song has shown high numbers in a consistent manner making it a winner both in initial sales and in the long run.
* By placing No. 1 this week, Love Scenario is now tied with **IU's Good Day** and **PSY's Gangnam Style** to have spent the most weeks as #1 on Gaon's weekly chart with 5 weeks.

Countdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5yfjdx/produce_101_pick_me_%EB%82%98%EC%95%BC_%EB%82%98_mnet_m_countdown_170309/). So I decided to put together a special post of what they've done since then.

Some basic information: **at least 65** of the 101 trainees have released music since Broduce 101. Plenty more have been active in performing, fanmeetings, advertisement contracts, and acting. A few have left trainee life after participating in the show. There are also a few who have been silent online. If anyone can fill in any information, I would appreciate it!

I am working on a [page of the contestants' SNS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broduce101/wiki/sns) so people who would like to keep up with a given contestant can use it. So far I've gotten everyone's Instagrams (that I'm aware of) and I'll fill in the rest eventually.

790,2018-3-10,2018,3,10,0,837bp8,Spotlight - The Boyz,hyunniebun,1520608052,"#Spotlight - The Boyz 

So! The Boyz are having a comeback in March, and I decided to create this post to help some who might be interested in them. I've seen the Spotlight posts and I've kind of always wanted to make my own, but never really had the chance until The Boyz came around! Hopefully I can share some of the love :) Sorry in advance to other Spotlights, I'm pretty much borrowing the format for myself (I mean, it does look pretty good...) Also, I know that 12 members can look pretty intimidating, but trust me, they fit amazingly well together and it is surprisingly easy to get to know them. 

##Intro

[The Boyz](https://imgur.com/a/l5Ejy) is a 12 member group who are under Cre.ker Entertainment. They debuted on December 6, 2017. The members are: New, Q, Hyunjae, Juyeon, Jacob, Eric, Kevin, Juhaknyeon, Younghoon, Sunwoo, Hwall, and Sangyeon. As of now they have no fandom name (the fans call themselves the fanz right now, I personally would rather it not be that). The group was first announced as Cre.kerz on social media by Cre.ker but it was later changed to The Boyz. They held their first fanmeeting ""Heart to Heart"" for 1000 fans on October 28. 

##Members

For each member, I'll include things like birth date, full name, etc. All ages are international. The group is newer (It's been about three months since their debut! woo) so there aren't many pictures of the members or them as a group yet. Because of this I'll include their official debut photo and then 3 or 4 photos I really like that I think show their different sides well. I'll include whatever facts I can think of that are interesting and a few short clips that show their personality. Trust me, this group has plenty of personality. Each member has an offical introduction video that is only a minute or two long, so I will include those as well! I focused a lot more on personality here than in past Spotlights, but there really isn't a lot known about them considering they just debuted. 

###[Juhaknyeon](https://imgur.com/a/6riue)

Full Name: Joo Haknyeon ()

DOB: March 9, 1999 (age 19)

POB: Jeju, South Korea

Position: Lead Dancer

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpO9bsC1KB4)

Haknyeon is well-known for being on Produce101 Season 2 last year, where he was eventually eliminated at 19th place. Haknyeon is actually [really good at b-boying](https://youtu.be/S_AGyrgqtRw?t=28s). He is half Chinese and half Korean. He has one older sister and one younger sister. He grew up on a pig farm in Jeju, and also spent some time in Hong Kong. For a little while after P101 it was uncertain if he would debut with The Boyz, and so fans took pictures of smashed crackers and sent it to Cre.ker, their company (It cracks me up just thinking about it so I included it). For [his first vlive after his confirmed debut](http://www.vlive.tv/video/33728), he drew 263, 432 viewers and 15,028,683 hearts, by far the most for the group's vlive channel since. He also did the broadcast with a [pig from his farm](https://imgur.com/a/jNPOw) (it's too cute, I can't...). His parents even gave him a ""Feeding Award"" because as a kid he did such a good job feeding the pigs (I CAN'T). On vlives for the group, they usually use emojis to represent the members in each video when it isn't too many of them, and Haknyeon's is usually a pig!

###[Kevin](https://imgur.com/a/errWC)

Full name: Moon Hyung-seo () 

He goes by and prefers his English name: Kevin Moon ( )

DOB: February 23, 1998 (age 20)

POB: Vancouver, Canada

Position: Main Vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh8zud_OjwQ)

Kevin is a fluent English speaker as he was born in Canada, and is the best English speaker in The Boyz (both Eric and Jacob speak English fluently as well, but I believe Kevin's English is the most natural with little to no accent). He has one older sister. Pre-debut Kevin had a YouTube channel known as FLOSS, where it's been shown that he is [about as weird as it gets](https://youtu.be/5mMa_aoPh1c?t=2m52s). He can also [draw really well](https://youtu.be/5mMa_aoPh1c?t=58s) and he even designed the group's logo. He went to college for four days before dropping out to join The Boyz. He also [really, really loves Beyonce](https://youtu.be/5mMa_aoPh1c?t=1m34s). He has a very cute [boxy smile!](https://imgur.com/a/4VUP4) He was the host for Dreamcatcher's ASC episode. He was also on [K-pop Star 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfCnXsyW328), and has a very nice voice. He was casted for The Boyz from his time on K-Pop Star. He can also play the piano and composes. In their vlives his emoji is usually a moon since that is his last name. 

---

###[Hwall](https://imgur.com/a/qU7kE)

Full name: Heo Hyun-joon ()

DOB: March 9, 2000 (age 18)

POB: Busan, South Korea

Position: Dance, vocal, rap

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZwCyuH4dZ8)

Hwall is considered in charge of fashion with The Boyz, and has a talent for coordinating outfits. He is one of those idols that has an extreme dichotomy, similar to Taemin: he goes from [stone faced to extremely cute](https://youtu.be/2ekXt5lDiPA) so quickly it can cause whiplash. He is an [extreme BTS fanboy](https://youtu.be/lLrHS0R62WA?t=1m3s) (he's the only one that knows the dance and the others just start doing the DNA formation lmao). His role model is Jimin (BTS). His name actually means 'bow' and he says he's the secret weapon of The Boyz. He was also in Melody Day's Color music video along with Hyunjae, Younghoon, and Eric. 

---

###[Sangyeon](https://imgur.com/a/AbBsX)

Full name: Lee Sang-yeon ()

DOB: November 4, 1996(age 21)

Position: Temporary leader, Vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiF6B_M88Rs)

Sangyeon is the temporary leader of The Boyz and considered the 'father' of the group. He was street-casted for his profile as he was going to get rice burgers after school one day. He was an actor with Pristin's Nayoung in [Ailee's If You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3tIkwvUjJg), and is also in [Melody Day's You Seem Busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbpszsQXoLs). He has one older sister. There isn't too much known about Sangyeon so far, so [here's an extra clip](https://youtu.be/7Avj1ql-vAM?t=4m39s) that really showcases his personality.

---

###[Hyunjae](https://imgur.com/a/IjYEk)

Full name: Lee Jae-hyun ()

DOB: September 13, 1997 (20)

Position: Visual, Vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtRC_xK1G4A)

Hyunjae graduated from Hanlim Art School. He appeared with Haknyeon in [Melody Day's You Seem Busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbpszsQXoLs) music video, where Sangyeon starred. He was also in [Melody Day's Color music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKfpMkDk87I) along with Hwall, Younghoon, and Eric. His talent is spinning things, and can spin almost anything (as shown in his introduction video). He also [makes random squawking noises](https://youtu.be/Dpamkv9wPYs?t=36s) a lot.

---

###[Jacob](https://imgur.com/a/J9GQm)

Full name: Bae Joon-young ()

He goes by and prefers his English name: Jacob Bae ()

DOB: May 30, 1997 (age 20)

POB: Toronto, Canada

Position: Vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4utuu1471YY)

Jacob is one of the three fluent English speakers in The Boyz. If Sangyeon is the dad of the group, Jacob is the mom, and he takes care of everyone. [He's pretty much the angel](https://youtu.be/xDvOQFdJgYc?t=2m28s) of the group, and he [really, really likes cereal](https://youtu.be/xDvOQFdJgYc?t=24s). He is really good friends with Kevin, and the two are nicknamed 'Canada Bros' by the international fans. [He also really hates horror movies](https://youtu.be/AtWly7CKodI?t=10m29s). He can also play the guitar and compose. 

---

###[Q](https://imgur.com/a/IYvvm)

Full name: Ji Chang-min ()

DOB: November 5, 1998 (age 19)

Position: Dance

[Introduction video](https://imgur.com/a/IYvvm)

Q is known as the [best dancer in The Boyz](https://youtu.be/IKu95KqVh1s?t=24s). He is similar to Hwall in that he's adorable most of the time but becomes an intense dancer unexpectedly. He was casted from his dance studio. His stage name is Q because When you say Q, it has a feeling that everything is starting. I named myself Q because I liked that and I feel that I am in the center at the start. He takes pride in his long neck and says it is his charming point. Because of this he is often associated with a giraffe among the members, but since they can't find giraffe emojis he is often represented by a squirrel in their vlives.

---

###[Younghoon](https://imgur.com/a/d5Nh8)

Full name: Kim Young Hoon ()

DOB: August 08, 1997 (age 20)

Position: Visual, Vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCAxcIPkUXw)

Younghoon has one older brother. He is known as the main visual of the group, along with Hyunjae and Juyeon. Younghoon is very quiet, is a little strange, and can be a little intense, although he [can be really cute](https://youtu.be/8FXj7bM2Zec?t=4m38s). Younghoon modeled for the [Paul Miranda Italy Pictorial](https://imgur.com/a/lCa5Y). Younghoon has also modeled for [Seoul Fashion Week 2017](https://imgur.com/a/4qbO2), along with Juyeon. Younghoon was scouted for his looks while he was eating bread at a convenience store. He was also the boyfriend in IOI's [Whatta Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOn5tSagerY) MV, and appeared in [John Park's DND MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6_IK4Tt_PQ).

###[New](https://imgur.com/a/k7U2D)

Full name: Choi Chan-hee ()

DOB: April 26, 1998 (Age 19)

POB: Jeonju, South Korea

Position: Vocal

[Introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfrWXk59wQg)

New is one of the [unofficial visuals of The Boyz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1dpPjq8Nus) (they're all  visuals, really). He has one older brother, and is really good at [mental math](https://youtu.be/EL4x-xttSeQ). Here is his cover of [When We Were Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faHAcw98Gwk). He seems confident but can be very shy. He seems close to Q especially. New is probably the only really sane member.

---

###[Sunwoo](https://imgur.com/a/NYhig)

Full name: Kim Sun-woo ()

DOB: April 12, 2000 (age 17)

Position: Rapper, vocal

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qj9gSDUaeE)

Sunwoo is the main rapper of the group. Here is a clip of his [rapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqr_emLpH8E). Sunwoo [really, really likes juice.](https://youtu.be/DNbmgAIYXQc?t=4m53s). He is very mature for his age, and acts more like an older uncle than one of the youngest members. He is currently a sophomore (2nd year) at Hanlim Art High School. He was on MNET's [High School Rapper](https://youtu.be/kB6k3hBEZGA?t=1m48s).

---

###[Eric](https://imgur.com/a/3GVI3)

Full name: Son Young-jae ()

DOB: December 22, 2000 (17)

POB: Born in South Korea but grew up in Los Angeles, CA

Position: Dance, vocal

Eric is the third fluent English speaker in The Boyz. Although he was born in South Korea, he grew up in LA. He has one older sister. He has a talent for solving rubix cubes in less than a minute. He is the youngest member and tends to never stop talking. 


---

###[Juyeon](https://imgur.com/a/ja0Y8)

Full name: Lee Ju-yeon ()

DOB: January 15, 1998 (age 20)

Position: Dance, visual

[Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0GUtrHvUB4)

Juyeon is the third official visual for the group. He modeled for [Seoul Fashion Week 2017](https://imgur.com/a/4qbO2) along with Younghoon. He is considered one of the best dancers, after Q. He is very serious and tends to be a little gullible, so he gets upset easily. He got street-casted while he was watching a performance with his family and was given the casting director's business card. Juyeon is very flexible and can even do a split while in jeans, as shown in his introduction video.

##Songs, Performances, and Covers

##Vlives, Variety, and Social Media

Facebook: [officialTHEBOYZ](https://www.facebook.com/officialTHEBOYZ)

Twitter: [Creker_THEBOYZ](https://twitter.com/Creker_THEBOYZ)

Instagram: [official_theboyz](https://www.instagram.com/official_theboyz/)

Youtube: [THE BOYZ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJ1rbOrsyPfBuHNfnLPm-Q)

V-live: [THE BOYZ](http://channels.vlive.tv/DE341F/video)

Their v-live channel is extremely active right now, with a video almost every or every other day. Because there are so many videos, and they are constantly updating these are the videos I recommend at first:

They have a series, shot pre-debut, where they own and manage their own cafe, along with random little variety snippets like dance battles happening as well. It is very good for getting to know them, and there are eight 45 minute episodes, so it is quite a lot to watch. It's called The Boyz 'Flower Snack.' [Ep. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl39AHikC4I&amp;t).

[[THE BOYZ] 1010](http://www.vlive.tv/video/43316?channelCode=DE341F) is a favorite of mine.

They also have an ongoing series called [The 100](http://www.vlive.tv/video/59120?channelCode=DE341F) that showcases their personalities very well. Each episode is only about ten minutes long, so they're easy to watch if you don't have a ton of time. 

If you watch all of that you have a pretty good idea of whose who and who you prefer to watch, since they tend to do vlives in pairs. They are a very new group so there isn't really a dedicated subbing team for these vlives that I know, so it can take a while for new videos to get subbed.

I also recommend Kevin's chill drawing streams, they're very relaxing. You can usually tell its him by the moon emoji. [Here's one](http://www.vlive.tv/video/60040?channelCode=DE341F).

You also can't miss this [legendary all English vlive by Kevin, Eric, and Jacob.](http://www.vlive.tv/video/45068?channelCode=DE341F). ~~Drinking game: count the awkward pauses.~~

As for non-vlive variety, they have a Come On! The Boyz series on YouTube which has 4 episodes, each around 25 min long. [Ep 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUOX3RQRrGo&amp;t).

##Coming Soon

The Boyz have announced their next comeback for late March, so check it out if they have caught your interest! They're really special and they've done a lot to help me lately, so hopefully they can help cheer up some of you guys too!

As we get to the end of the first quarter of 2018, there are a lot of groups and artists (at least for me) that have gone ""missing"" with no word on comebacks or activities this year. In some cases, almost 2 years has passed with no word on any planned activity.

Some groups and artists I've followed who have gone missing are listed below. What are some other groups you followed that have dropped off the face of the earth?

* Bestie - no new release since 2015. Down to 2 members. Hye Yeon recently on The Unit.
* Blady - no new music since 2015
* Lim Kim - reported to have ended her contract with Mystic Entertainment in 2016. Dropped off the map since.
* U Sung Eun - no new music since duet with Kisum in 2016
* Sunny Hill - left LOEN in 2017 and regroup under different management. MIA
* 4Ten (Poten) - no releases in almost 2 1/2 year
* Berry Good - approaching 1 year since last song. Members appeared on Mix Nine.

Welcome to the Artist Spotlight for Wanna One!  Wanna One is a group composed of the top 11 trainees from the 2017 show Produce 101 Season 2!  Wanna One is a temporary group, and will disband at the end of 2018.  Their fans are called Wannables!

I wanted to make a Spotlight for this group ever since seeing a couple discussions about whether or not this sub was sleeping on the group.  It's definitely understandable that Wanna One isn't as big on here, considering that PD101 didnt blow up nearly as much internationally compared to nationally.  I decided that I wanted to help broaden the appeal of the group to a larger audience here if I could at all.  I really love all these boys a lot, and hope that you can give this group a chance!

This Spotlight was inspired by all the other amazing Spotlights fans have created on this sub (apologies if I missed any!): [Stray Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7p2ssr/spotlight_stray_kids/), [Pristin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6u2d7a/spotlight_pristin/), [NCT](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6woh7c/spotlight_nct/), [AOA](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/76octc/spotlight_aoa/), [KNK](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/77yxcr/spotlight_knk/), [Sistar](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7a0xvb/spotlight_sistar/), [Pentagon](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7eoed5/spotlight_pentagon/), [LOONA](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6xypcp/a_primer_on_loona/), [BTOB](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7519rb/spotlight_btob/), and [The Boyz](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/837bp8/spotlight_the_boyz/)!

#Produce 101 Season 2

Produce 101 (PD101) is a reality survival show.  In this show, 101 trainees from a multitude of different companies compete against each other.  The public votes for their favorite trainees from the show, and after several eliminations the final top 11 trainees are selected to be in a project group that will disband after a certain amount of time.  

Season 1 had female trainees, and created the legendary group IOI.  Season 2 had male trainees, and Wanna One is the group created from this season.  IOI was a temporary group, disbanding in the beginning of 2017.  Similarly, Wanna One is set to disband at the end of 2018.

With IOI, trainees in IOI were able to promote outside of that group (thus, Whatta Man was with a subunit of IOI as Mina, Sejung and Chaeyeon promoted with their other permanent groups).  With Wanna One, the members are by contract unable to promote with other groups while they are with Wanna One.

Throughout Produce 101, the contestants formed into teams to present stages.  Some highlights stages from the show are: 

* [Sorry Sorry Team 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg6b6VUIW80) - My personal favorite - if you only watch one of these, watch this one!  I can go on all day about this team and its importance to the show (and I kinda do in the bonus document, see the very end of this post).  This performance was for the very first challenge, when there were still 101 contestants.  Of this group of 6, four of them (Daniel, Jaehwan, Ong, and Minhyun) made it into the top eleven!  This stage was the first one to really go viral in Korea, and for a good reason.  This was an amazing mature cover of the song, featuring [phenomenal vocals](https://youtu.be/Gg6b6VUIW80?t=1m42s) coming from Jaehwan!  
* [Never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmbMEZq8tIg) - Never was an original song produced for the show by Hui and E'Dawn of Pentagon!  Never is a tropical house song, and these boys absolutely did the song justice.  On this song, all but one member (Kim Jonghyun of Nu'est) made it into the final group.  This song once again features some [phenomenal vocals](https://youtu.be/kmbMEZq8tIg?t=2m42s) coming from Jaehwan!
* [Downpour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGjZmKqSBug) - This was a phenomenal and very emotional vocal cover of the IOI song!  Of these five boys, all but Hyunbin (currently in the group JBJ) made it into Wanna One.  Ha Sungwoon got noticed for his [very emotional fancam and his strong vocals](https://youtu.be/YGLEUb91zo4?t=1m12s).  Once again, [Kim Jaehwan's vocals](https://youtu.be/nGjZmKqSBug?t=2m26s) absolutely slay the stage (Are you sensing a trend with this?  Seriously, Kim Jaehwan's vocals are incredible!).
* [Open Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPJRT1cSxM) - Open Up was another original song created for this show.  This stage is one with a very sexy atmosphere.  Unfortunately, only Kang Daniel made it into Wanna One from this group - but he really shined on this stage.  Iconic is his [sultry opening look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPJRT1cSxM) and[ thigh move](https://youtu.be/ahPJRT1cSxM?t=2m7s).
* [Get Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqeMUdEMImI) - For this challenge, these boys had to create the choreography to an existing song.  In this cover, we got to see some of [Daniel B-Boying](http://i.imgur.com/q3iyzqQ.gif), [Ong's crazy expressions](https://youtu.be/aqeMUdEMImI?t=1m42s) and Woojin's [amazing stage presence](https://youtu.be/5l9JIQyueNk?t=22s).  Even though Woojin was [much lower ranked than his teammates](https://youtu.be/z7Hkl61swn0?t=3m38s) at the time of this challenge (that team consisted of the trainees ranked 1, 2, 4, 5, 6...and Woojin at rank 24), he placed first among this team!  Jihoon from this team also made it into Wanna One.
* [Shape of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-97IBVz0U) - This was for the same challenge as Get Ugly so these boys had to create the choreography to an existing song.  Unfortunately, no one in this group made it into Wanna One, but this stage is still a legendary one for how amazing the choreography they created is.  Notable is the killing part [soon after this](https://youtu.be/H2-97IBVz0U?t=53s)!

There were so many other excellent stages from Produce 101!  If you want to see more of them, [this site](https://liliananbookish.wordpress.com/2017/06/07/wednesday-k-pop-with-liliana-best-produce-101-season-2-performances/) has a great write up of their top 13 stages from the show.

Its really important to know just how much this show blew up in South Korea.  It became a cultural phenomenon there, with schools being [covered in flyers](https://i.imgur.com/Erafgks.jpg) people made for their favorite contestants.  Both in views and in likes, [all ten of the top ten naver videos of the year](https://www.soompi.com/2018/01/30/naver-tv-reveals-popular-videos-channels-2017/) were PD101 related.  PD101 was announced to be the second most influential show of the year, with Goblin in first place.  People were not joking when they said School 2017 would have to include this show!

Do you have to have seen Produce 101 to love Wanna One?  Of course not!!  Wanna One is more than just the result of this show, they are an amazing group with amazing people, and its totally fine to love them even without seeing PD101. :)

Also, if you want to know more about PD101 stages, see the document at the very end of this post!  I made a really long and much more informal (and meme filled!) document about this for an irl friend, and I attached this document at the very end of this post. &lt;3

* Has a really strong mentality.  I really admire him in [this segment](https://youtu.be/yAxvx5PrKOg) from PD101.  Here, he was the lowest ranked trainee put onto this team, and had a chance of being eliminated before being able to perform this song.  Yet he still worked really hard.  In this clip, the dance teacher had just asked for a volunteer to dance the song alone, and he was the only one who volunteered.

#Music Videos

* [Energetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVaV7AwqBWg)  This is Wanna One's debut song, produced by Pentagons Hui!  It's a tropical house song with the most aesthetic MV ever.  The [piano choreography at the beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeekjXMmv38) is really interesting, and some [amazing fansite pictures](https://twitter.com/flowerroad_0527/status/894778057826877441) have been the result!
* [Burn It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwGqz8BhHho)  This song has a really hard hitting choreo, Id recommend watching the [dance practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqeEcAfHggI) instead of the MV to see it (especially [this part](https://youtu.be/hqeEcAfHggI?t=3m4s))!!
* [Wanna Be \(My Baby\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiCnvgH6fz4)  Fun song that integrate some PD101 Season 2 memes into the choreography.  This is a live performance they filmed at their debut show-con!  Some cool behind the scenes of right before their debut at the very beginning of this video.
* Beautiful  [Story Version Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtjXehMBpLQ), [Story Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_tHTmniw4) and [Performance Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXWyJEo6VgA) (this one is amazing)  A slower ballad song.
* [I Promise You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NlNEj2mCIg)  A song released for their fans recently!

#Wanna One Go

Wanna One Go is the debut reality show of Wanna One!  So far, two seasons have aired, and a third season is on the way!  If you want to learn more about the boys, this show is hilarious and well edited, and is a really fast way of getting to know them all.
The first season shows the boys all move into their dorm, and then are grouped in pairs/one trio and tied together for twenty four hours.

The second season was called Zero Base, named after the secret hidden space which hid an amazing secret space that had basically everything a person could want.  There, the boys were able to relax and decompress after their really hectic schedules.  Occasionally, some of the boys would leave the base to complete challenges, such as paragliding down a mountain.

[Wanna One Go Season 1 teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCFBJFQZL9I), and [behind the scenes of the teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hN_nXGVF88) (important video)

[Wanna One Go Season 2 teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cL5hZI-Vk0&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLm26vEznHcmfknQNtPmQfVSsRAgQFL9Cn) and [behind the scenes of the teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVH9Zn2Owjo&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLm26vEznHcmfknQNtPmQfVSsRAgQFL9Cn)

####Recommended episodes:

Season 1 episode 1  In this episode, the boys move into their current dorm and roommates are picked.  Groups are made, with each group having to remain within a meter of each other for 24 hours!

Season 1 episode 2  In this episode, the boys visit a theme park, and the 24 hours of being a meter apart from each other ends.  The end of this episode shows the boys at their debut show-con, which is, of course, very emotional. &lt;3

Season 2 episode 1  I really want to highlight the segment from minute 6 to minute 18.  This segment is self filmed with our main vocal Kim Jaehwan as the MC.  This segment follows the group as they travel around the globe to various fanmeets, and Jaehwan tries to write a song for Wannables with help from the rest of Wanna One.  This segment really shows off the group and their hilarious interactions!

#Subreddits
Currently, there are two subreddits that both have Wanna One content.

r/Broduce101 - This subreddit was where PD101 was discussed during its run.  Content about all the trainees from the show is posted there, and this includes Wanna One content.  Currently, this sub is also discussing Idol Producer, a Chinese show with a very similar premise to PD101.

r/WannaOne - This subreddit focuses only on Wanna One.  This subreddit is less active than the other one, but still has a lot of amazing content on the boys :)

***
#Bonus: JBJ and Rainz
JBJ and Rainz are two other groups that are formed only from Produce 101 contestants!
The story of JBJ is a really emotional one.  Fans had created this group as a dream team made of eliminated contestants with amazing talent and stage presence.  Those trainees noticed this and expressed their interest in becoming a group, and eventually JBJ actually came into existence!  They debuted with [Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGYIpwovVsc), and recently had a comeback with [My Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uexk7jWXYmU).  I love JBJ to bits, they really do deserve the world.  As an aside, whoever the graphic designer is for JBJ is amazing, everything from their logo to their profile images to their album designs have been total eye candy.

Rainz is a third group created from PD101 contestants.  These contestants all became friends on the show, and their companies came together to make the group a reality!  Their debut song, [Juliette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odNUd0t4AlA), was amazing (a truly underrated bop), and the music video featuring a VR girlfriend was really interesting.  They had a comeback with the song [Turn It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECkZ2eKGyck).

#Final Notes

Wanna One really is an amazing group made of amazing boys.  I hope that reading through this essay of a post was interesting for you and helped you learn about what makes the group so awesome! [For those curious about the character count of this thing.](https://imgur.com/a/emOnE)

Wanna One is having a comeback on March 19th with title song Boomerang.  If this post got you interested in the group at all, I hope that you'll give the song a listen! 

A couple of days ago, I posted a rough draft of this post to r/broduce101 to get feedback on it!  I'd like to thank the awesome folks who looked over the rough draft - u/uera, u/tastetherainbeau, u/zPappy, and u/NyanNyan_.  A really huge thank you to u/pinkishblueish who spent a lot of time helping me with the member profiles and who had some really amazing ideas for this post.  Ya'll gave some awesome suggestions and I really appreciate all of you! &lt;3

Let me know if you have any questions about the group, or if any of the links aren't working!

[I love Wanna One so much!  &lt;3](https://img.kpopmap.com/2018/02/2018-gaon-chart-awards-wanna-one-daesang.jpg)

#And One Final Bonus!

For an irl friend that wanted to know more about PD101, I created a document talking about the must see stages.  This document is about four pages of text and 120 pages of the (spiciest) memes, fanart and fansite photos!

As a disclaimer, this document is much more informal, since it is for an irl friend, and also focuses a lot more on the older members of Wanna One, specifically Daniel, Ong, Minhyun and Jaewhan.  It also talks a bit more about JBJ and a lot more about the rise of Nuest!  If you want to see this document, you can view it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TNvcY7h6tmZaL9CnBxpIGDhmxMWVkmJE/view?usp=sharing)!  

Enjoy, and thank you for reading this post! :)

I saw a larger than usual crowd gathered around one performance, and when I approached I heard Hobogoblin was being played. When I got closer my thought process went something like this: this dance crew is really good - they even nailed the outfits and totally have idol visuals, that's very impressive - damn they even got one girl that looks like Sorn - WAIT! That is Sorn! So that's really CLC! I'm not familiar with CLC members other than Sorn, but all stood out to me because they really are all very pretty irl. Apparently I came in quite late because they performed Black Dress before Hobogoblin, in fact they crashed the performance of a dance crew called Diana (you can see it all on their vlive channel). I thought about calling out to Sorn when they finish performing but by the end a lot more people have gathered around and fans immediately swarmed them when they started to leave, so I decided I value my life too much for that. Notably they had *lots* of fangirls around, more than fanboys actually, and all seemed to be endlessly excited after seeing the girls live. Good for CLC for doing something like that, it was a really fun surprise and I wish I could have come in sooner!",32,314

For example, I love how casual the comment section for [Up and Down](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2eow3u/mv_exid_up_down/) is.

Also remember when Gfriend was just  a [cute homage to SNSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2sh59j/%EC%97%AC%EC%9E%90%EC%B9%9C%EA%B5%ACgfriend_%EC%9C%A0%EB%A6%AC%EA%B5%AC%EC%8A%ACglass_bead_music_video/)?

 ^(Definitely guilty of that mindset myself.)

The IGAB teaser and MV comment sections crack me up too.

I was speaking about kpop generations to a new kpop fan and realised that while it is obviously a fan concept with no real grounds for it, a lot of kpop fans refer to them to place kpop groups in time; but there is no real agreement on the so called generations.

The one that mostly everyone seem to agree on is the separation between 1st generation groups and 2nd generation ones. It goes from the 1990's until the mid 2000's when some of the ""old groups"" have disbanded (H.O.T., S.E.S, ...) and new groups begin to rise. The line is a bit blurry but groups from 2006 and onwards tend to be considered as 2nd generation groups (BIGBANG, SNSD, Brown Eyed Girls...).

That's when it gets even more complicated. There's no real consensus on the beginning (or not) of the 3rd generation and what would define it. Some people even argue that there is a 4th and 5th generation after that.

**So what should be the delimiters between kpop generations?**

To me, 2006 marks the beginning of the *generalisation of kpop Idol groups as we know them*; with YGE debuting BIGBANG, JYPE debuting Wonder Girls and SM debuting Girls' Generation. All that was before that is thus part of the 1st generation.

The delimiter between the 2nd and a 3rd generation could be *the ""boom"" of new Idol groups* happening around 2012 following or not the international hype around Psy's Gangnam Style. There is a dozen or less relevant groups founded each year of the 2nd generation (based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_Korean_idol_groups_(2000s\)) and [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_Korean_idol_groups_(2010s\))) until 2010 and 2011 with around 20 each, and 2012 with nearly 40.

I would then argue that there is a 4th generation afterwards that would, for me, be delimited by *the  hype around survival shows such as Sixteen and Produce 101.* There were survival shows before (that resulted in the creation of VIXX and Monsta X) but the phenomenon arguably became domestically massive with Twice and IOI.

**What are you thoughts on this, how many kpop generations are there and what makes them different from each other?**",42,51

Its rare to have that many members and have that many that can sing. Usually its like Mamamoo or Davichi or a rare case in DBSK. 

So the challenge is averaging out all the members and finding out whos on top in these categories:

Vocal, Dance, Variety, Face, Rap

My pick will be girl groups coz Im not familiar with boygroups

Vocal: Gugudan
Dance: hard, coz usually there is only one member that is an expert. 
Variety: Snsd or apink. Most of them are gagdols except one or two members (Naeun or Tiffany)
Face: This is hard coz most of them are goodlooking, AOA or if Im allowed to be biased my newly stan group,Gugudan
Rap: same thing as dance. majority of gg are ass on rapping",28,0

For example I think Loona is for people who complex or interesting concepts. Those who enjoy the music and production over the melody and lyrics and who could obsess about the minor details of a group's music and concepts 

I tried lol

e: [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7y3x77/makes_music_for_people_who/) for answers:

&gt; * DJ Khaled makes music for people who dont do anything on group projects.

&gt; * Grimes makes music for herself and herself only.

&gt; * Imagine Dragons makes music for people who don't really like rock music but pretend they do.

&gt; * The Chainsmokers make music for people who tell everyone they're huge EDM fans and listen exclusively to Trap Nation on YouTube

&gt; * Cupcakke makes music for white gay men who like to pretend they're hoes when they're scrolling through memes all alone on their bed and have been for at least the past two hours.",182,188

I want to thank everyone who participated, I got nothing but kind words from everyone, so it made it very enjoyable to do. If you didnt win, I hope you will try again in the next giveaway!

One of the perks, for me, of doing the giveaways is that I get to ask for a little something back from you guys. In both my giveaways, I had people answer a few questions about the groups (who is you bias, favorite song,ect) as the entry. The reason I wanted to do this is because one of the things I aim to do with these giveaways is to not only support the groups, but build our community as well. One of the great things about free stuff is that people will go a little out of their comfort zone to have a chance at it. As such, I ask these questions because I think its great when we can share what we love about these groups and show our support for them.

I enjoyed reading all the entries, and I have compiled the answers into some data points that I think are interesting, so I thought I would share them. Remember that these results are only based on the entries into the Stray Kids giveaway, and the entries into the Marmello giveaway, but I think it provides a decent look at the active fan-base of each group on this subreddit. Anyways, here you go:

___________________________________________________________

I also wanted to announce that the next giveaway I will be doing is for Dreamcatcher!

Once the album is officially announced, I will make a thread for entries but I wanted to let you guys know whats on the horizon so you can watch out for it.

Dreamcatcher is a group that is very dear to my heart and is one of my top 3 favorite groups.  As such, because I want the world for them and I want to see them succeed, this giveaway will be a SUPER GIVEAWAY.

What's a SUPER GIVEAWAY you ask?  Well, I am going to be giving away **20 brand new Dreamcatcher albums**.  Thats right, **20**!

The most entries we have had so far is 160 for the Weki Meki giveaway.  Even if we get that many for the Dreamcatcher giveaway, your odds are still 1/8 to win a copy.  Those are some great odds to win a free album, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled once the album is announced!

Among K-Pop fans, there seems to be differing opinions on when or if a group is disbanded or has been abandoned by their agency. While it's pretty clear cut when the management company formally announces a disbanding, more often than not groups ""disappear"" or ""go on hiatus"", never returning again. In some cases, the agencies release the idols who then go on to join other groups or reconstitute a group under a new name and concept, like Minx to Dreamcatcher. In other cases, they are just flat out in limbo with no word of comeback or promotions. In some cases, the groups appear to be abandoned by their companies, who hold them to their contracts but do not promote the idols.

Just from my own perspective, I would consider a group that has not actively promoted or had a comeback in 3 years or more to be considered disbanded.

Some examples of groups without formal announcements of disbanding or in an unusual state:

* KARA - consists of only Youngji who promotes in Japan as KARA
* Secret - down to one member Hana
* Dal Shabet - only Woohee is left
* After School/Orange Caramel - AS has not released in 5 years, OC in 4
* Blady - no comeback or promotions in 3 years

What are some other groups out there that you think should be considered abandoned or formally disbanded at this time?

What is the most effective way to make sure that idols get the money, rather than some middleman? I used to think buying physical albums was effective, but now I'm not so sure if they're actually that profitable. Since I don't live in Korea, most options for buying merch are from third parties as well. If I buy merch from a site like kpopmart or even ebay, who is that money really going to?

I'm definitely willing to spend money, but I'm also curious about how much you think streaming and watching music performances and generally spreading popularity makes a difference in these idols' pockets.

Edit to clarify: I'm not sure how profitable albums actually are because of the cost it will take to produce an album, not because I'm worried about middlemen taking all the money.",33,110

I ended up with a DVD that had an episode on it and I was able to play it on my tv and it was awesome haha. I might start watching a music show each week now. I was wondering if anyone else does this and which music show is your favorite? And which one has the best camerawork? I noticed in the episode I watched that there was some focus on girls' crotch areas a handful of times lol... I'd prefer to not have that haha.

I found full episodes of M Countdown, Music Bank, Show Music Core, and Inkigayo on kshow123.net and all of them except M Countdown had Eng subs too! Kpop is so accessible to international fans it's amazing lol.

Most representative doesen't have to be the most known but rather the one that displays the elements of the subgenre in the most clear way.

Before we get into the projects, there's just a bit of housekeeping to cover.

**Posting Date and New Format**

Due to starting a new job, Ill likely be able to post these roundups the 2nd and 3rd week of the month. 

Also, due to my work taking so much of my time, thses Roundups will only include projects that are for the current month plus the following month. So for example, this roundup includes projects that end in both March and April. Next month's roundup will include projects that end in April and May.

This new format allows me to still post these roundups but allow cuts down on the amount of extra work I have to do to compile this.

Hope y'all still decide to stick around. Ill still work to get them out as quick as I can!

Now onto the projects!

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)
	

**[MONT Mini-Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mont_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 20, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is MONT?

MONT is a three member boy group signed to FM Entertainment. They officially debuted on May 18 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-aXAJR60Y)"". According to their official thread on OneHallyu, the group was initially intended to be five members, releasing 1 single as 3 members, then another with 4, and then the final single as 5 before officially debuting. However, the information is unsourced and with the release of this Makestar, it seems that the group will only have three members.

Their fandom name is MINT.

The group became popularly known due to their audition on the YG show *MIXNINE* due to having their label be situated in the middle of the woods in the country (and due to their CEO stating she used to sell kimbap). The group gave a [very polished audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9kFEv-Wbs) that impressed YG and passed all 3 MONT boys.

The boys did relatively decent while on the show if you take into account no one had heard of them prior to MIXNINE. All three were eventually eliminated prior to the finals, with Sangyeon (Bitsaeon) and Joongmin (Roda) being eliminated during the 1st round of cuts and Hyunwoo (Narachan) being cut during the second round of eliminations.

They have an active [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/montlove1/) and [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/montlove1/) as well.


**[Gunmin and Heedo Unit Album Project]( https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_big_03/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 28, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Gunmin and Heedo are two members of the k-pop group B.I.G, who have run [two](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_bigfanmeeting/) [previously](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_big/) successful Makestars in the past.

Gunmin and Heedo make up the groups first subunit.

A little bit about B.I.G (which stands for Boys in Groove), they are is a five member group signed to GH Entertainment. The group debuted in 2014 with the song [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp2emtZWc_k). According to the interwebs, Gunmin and Heedo trained at the Plug In Music Academy prior to joining B.I.G.  B.I.G didnt start getting more notice until their single [1.2.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MKp9dtH3eI), which was released without Minpyo (who was taking a break due to health issues at the time).

Gunmin and Heedo both auditioned for *The Unit*, performing a remix of Usher, Lil Jon, and Ludacris ""[Yeah!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5gGRvOkWKs)"". Heedo initially was the only member to pass the judges' votes after the duo failed to get a superboot, but Gunmin was eventually called back to join the show. Gunmin placed 33rd in the competition, while Heedo placed 28th.

Gunmins most notable performance was as part of Team Black in Unit B, which was a [mashup performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiS5uxrAjRM) of Stay by Zedd and Alessia Cara and Chained Up by Vixx. Heedos most notable performance was in Team White of Unit B, which performed the original song [My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL3wsFcU7Ts).

**[S.I.S Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is S.I.S?

So there actually isnt too much written about them in English, but [relevant wikia](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/S.I.S) page.

From what little I could gleam from the internet, S.I.S (which stands for Serendipity in Stars) is a six member girl group signed to XX Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Ive Got a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwx68Z99uk)"". According to their Makestar, the groups image is going for a little sister vibe. They do have a pretty active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sis6girls/) page.

The group auditioned on *The Unit* with a performance of GFriend's ""[Glass Bead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cng6NnsntK0)"", though only 3 members (Anne, Gauel, and Sebin) made it past the audition rounds. Anne eventually placed 22nd, Gaeul placed 39th, and Sebin placed 56th in the competition.

The project was initially slated to end December 28, 2017, but got an extension by Makestar to run until February 19. This is the projects second extension.


**[The Rose Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose_02/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. Also a relatively new group, they debuted on August 3 with the single [Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

The group previously ran a successful Makerstar for their previous [single album](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose/). They grossed 618% over their initial goal.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

They have an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bandtherose/).

**[Blah Blah 2nd Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_blahblah/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 3, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Blah Blah?

Blah Blah is a five member girl group signed to FAB Entertainment.

The group debuted on November 22, 2017 with the single [Good Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJARCe-5MnI).

Not too much else has been written about them besides the standard idol stats, but rapper Yuri was previously a member of SIDA under the name Yoori.

The groups main concept seems to a mixture of  innocence and sexiness (as stated via their makestar page), and their fandom name is Blahsome.

The group has an active [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWPh0P7Fqg2x78Si1uZ_LQ) page though.

**[A-yeon First Solo Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ayeon_01//)**

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is A-yeon?

Not to be confused with JYPs Baek A-yeon, this A-yeon is a female drummer who is a member of the Korean girl band Bebop, which has been active since 2013.

Not much has been written about the group in English, but the group is signed to Loen Entertainment. While Im not certain, the groups debut single was [I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ_f0MiDx6c), although they featured on Hummingbird Urban Stereos track [Maem Maem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-sDFUXskgU)"" a year prior.

The group has an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bebopofficial/), while A-yeon also have an active [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdld7SHk9IyYSkNrHA9B6Dw) channel where she posts her drum covers.

**[Son Hyo Kyous 1st Concert Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonhyokyou/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Son Hyo Kyou?

Son Hyo Kyou is a soloist signed to Choon Entertainment.

He debuted in 2015 with the single [White Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r33vwKQ1jvw) and has been releasing at least one digital single a year since. His most recent single was [We Should Have Been Friends]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4rYn77o6Wk) in 2017.

I havent been able to find much else about him in English.

**[NTB Debut Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ntb_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is NTB?

Not to be confused with the other (now defunct?) boy group N.T.B., NTB is a six-member boy group signed to OneWorld Entertainment.

While not confirmed on their Makestar, it seems NTB stands for **N**augh**t**y **B**oys.

The group has been promoting in a Japan from what seems to be late 2017 but are finally ready to debut in Korea.

While not much has been written about them in English, the group does have an active [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ntbstagram/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4L4rdgE0L-GyCDdJcNHujA) page.

Also, fancams of their Japan promos make it seem that NTBs debut song is going to be called [L.O.V.E.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXeVqt6GP8U).

**[Favorite Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_favorite/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Favorite?

Favorite is a six-member girl group signed to Astory Entertainment.

The group debuted on July 4, 2017 with the song [Party Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8kGYosDhPE). Prior to their debut, the group did pre-debut promotions under the name Astory Girls.

Besides general stats about the members, not much else has been written about them in English.

They do have an active [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/officialFavorite/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJTTbU6UUbaujM3wvm_4EA) channel though.

However, I feel it further infantilizes and objectifies women.",OKC_THROW_UP,1521520783,"To preface: I'm a diehard BTS, Red Velvet, Exo, Twice, and CLC fan. I've watched HOURS of music videos, variety shows, compilations, and dance videos learning the world that is Kpop.

As an asian american man in his late 20s, I've applauded Kpop in actually presenting asian men as attractive and desirable. Something that I have not seen in western media throughout my life. However, I feel uncomfortable with how women are treated in the industry. Are there any insights on how to cope with this confliction coming from a western point of view? I know there are distinct cultural differences so perhaps I'm trying to appropriate my ideals.

I sometimes feel ashamed as to why I like girl groups. I do buy into the attractiveness of the cutesy, aegyo aesthetic but it makes me feel uncomfortable as to why I like it.",25,0

A ballad banger is one that just *gets you*, right there, you feel it within you when you hear it and you just know it's the good stuff. A common factor for most of these that i've noticed is that they almost always build to something, wether it's some gigantic instrumental interlude or a high note where the singer grabs their voice and they just absolutely launch it into the stratosphere. There are few things better than a well built climax.

These are specially useful when you're sad or have had a rough day, you just throw one on and the best way I can describe it is that it's like a syringe that initially hurts when applied, however slowly but surely it drains a bit of that sadness or angst as if it was venom and at the end of it you *feel* just a little bit better.",119,108

I translate kpop songs that might be less popular that doesn't get translated. I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation.

P.S: lastly....I have taken a year off from work to start kpop business. Mostly making kpop videos. Here is the first one. [Zion t. Bio] (https://youtu.be/x3aYGVRmFTg) I hope you enjoy

The group then split into subunits and she debuted in F-ve Dolls. Later Co-Ed School disbanded and she ended up leaving F-ve Dolls and CCM along with another member. A few years later she appeared on Produce 101 but got eliminated. After that she signed with Pledis, then left. She signed with Duble Kick (Momoland's label). It was rumored that she would be in the survival show ""Finding Momoland"" but her label had her planned for a different group. She then leaves Duble Kick and signs with Mostable Music and participates in MIXNINE but is eliminated. She is set to debut in Mostable Music's upcoming Girl Group called High Color.

_____________

**Records this week:**

* By placing \#1 last week, **iKON's 'Love Scenario'** has now surpassed IU's 'Good Day' (5 weeks) and PSY's 'Gangnam Style' (5 weeks) to have spent **the most weeks as \#1 on Gaon's weekly chart in Gaon history with 6 weeks.** Its the longest charting \#1 song in Gaon history.
* **BIGBANG's 'Flower Road'** debuts at \#1 with a score of 74,232,321 points - making it **the highest scoring entry on Gaon's 2018 chart** thus far. And thats only with 5 days of charting. **MAMAMOO's 'Starry Night'** becomes the second highest scored entry with 67,547,097 this week. Previous record was held by **iKON's 'Love Scenario'** with 62,934,023 points.
* **5/6 songs from Heize's new EP '' are currently in Gaon's top 60.** Their rankings are: jenga (\#3),    (\#6),  (\#13),    (\#40), MIANHAE (\#59). With 'You, Clouds, Rain' still at \#36, **Heize currently has 6 songs within Gaon's top 60.**
* **MAMAMOO** prove their status as digital monster by ranking at \#15 in my 2018 cumulative points list just within 2 weeks. Heize follows at \#16 within 2 weeks. BIGBANG is at \#20 in the list with 1 week's worth of points.

**Other good stuff:**

* **Got7's 'Look'** debuted at **\#15** this week.
* **Got7 and Hyolyn's 'One and Only You'** keeps steadily rising on the charts. Debuted in the 90s 3 weeks ago but for prev. 2 weeks, it hit new peaks and is currently at \#76!
* **Busker Busker's Cherry Blossom Ending re-enters the chart at \#85 indicating that spring is here.**
* I just noticed this week that **M.C the Max's '/No matter where'** is still charting. It was released in 2016.
* **Jung Illhoon's 'She's Gone'** climbs up 8 spots to reach a new peak at \#90.
* **MoonMoon's new song ''** climbs up 15 spots to be #95.
* **NCT U's 'Boss'** debuts at **\#97.**
* **BTS's 'Blood, Sweat, Tears'** re-enters chart at **\#100.**
* **Chungha's** long run scores are better than Bolbbalgan4's and Sunmi's 2018 releases. (Not cumulative points, on a week-to-week basis.)

__________________

**T/N:**

This week, **Suzy's 'I Love Someone Else'** and **Jung Seunghwan's 'The Snowman'** dropped out of my noteworthy list. They were falling behind in the noteworthy section. Others at the risk of dropping next week: all pre-2018 releases except Jang Deok Cheol's 'Good Old Days' and Melomance's 'Gift.' BB4's 'First Love,' Sunmi's 'Heroine,' and Red Velvet's 'Bad Boy.' Mainly due to how strong newer releases from MAMAMOO, BIGBANG and Heize are. They'll likely compete with the top scoring ones thus far in Love Scenario and Good Old Days for top spots which makes the rest of the songs in the sheet looks even weaker in comparison. We'll see how they do next week though.",7,32

1954,2018-3-23,2018,3,23,0,86ck5h,Rap trends and Rap Lines in kpop,garfe,1521734155,"I was inspired to make this discussion from hearing NCT's Black on Black.  In it, there are no real lyrics since it's mainly a dance performance track except for the rap line of Taeyong, Mark and Lucas.  Now when people saw this, I saw comments like ""LUCAS IS PART OF THE RAP LINE"" and ""FINALLY THE RAP LINE IS COMPLETE"" as well as listening to ""Yestoday"" which is probably the first time I've really seen an SM song in years that had lyrics about personal feelings and was also rap focused, not a vocal focused song.
  
Reading those comments reminded me of how it feels like fans really anticipate rappers and the rap line in their Kpop groups lately but doesn't it feel like it wasn't always that way?  Or to be more specific, it feels like it suddenly started being really relevant to have notable rappers in a group than the past despite how much of an emphasis it felt like the first generation of Kpop placed on rap and hip-hop (even to the point of having someone in charge of ""english rap"").  When I was really new to the genre, I was very surprised to learn that the precursors of kpop like Seo Taiji were mainly inspired by rap, hip hop and New Jack Swing than just wanting to be their version of N'sync, Backstreet Boys etc. However as time went on, I remember reading that usually the role of rapper was assigned to the member who wasn't good at singing which feels like a complete reversal.  It also almost felt like only YG artists were the only ones focusing on strong rap artists.
  
What I want to discuss is what do you think caused these changing and rising trends especially today when the idea of a rap line feels like an increasingly important aspect.  Also, what do you think makes up a strong rap line?  ",19,34

1961,2018-3-23,2018,3,23,2,86d6if,Examples of matching theme group stage outfits,AyyThatGirl,1521738596,"Usually I find with Kpop girl groups they either all have the same exact outfit [Russian Roulette](https://youtu.be/vvcklHTrvo4) [The Boots](https://youtu.be/hL70Hr_WulE) or have completely random outfits that don't match [Heartshaker](https://youtu.be/T-OUHK_CDMs) [AIIYL](https://youtu.be/R7HFnTOsVNk). 

However I really like it when groups actually have a matching theme that shows off the individuality but they still look like a group on the whole. Ex: [AOA Give Me The Love](https://youtu.be/x3kx5OV1zXo) not a stage outfit but I just really love the differences and how it suits each member. [Like Ooh Ahh](https://youtu.be/2ampM_S-19E) has to be one of my favourite Twice stage outfits with the camouflage, red and black. A more subtle example is [Secret Garden](https://youtu.be/kA-uplDSC3E) I love the small differences between sparkly and more velvety with flowers.

Also not trying to say I don't like the same group outfits or individual outfits, they all look pretty anyway but I really appreciate stylists showing that yes this is a group but no they're not all the same. ",45,77

I'm saying this after reading about Heechul setting up an appointment for Leeteuk to get counseling, it seems openly talking about getting help for it is very uncommon despite the amount of idols who've admitted to having depression, anxiety and the likes, the only other example I can think of is JinE getting help in her battle against anorexia. 

I was reading about Bom and if I understood it correctly her condition and use of medication was only forced out in the open because of the ""drug smuggling"" thing and we only learned about ChoAs condition and getting teatment for it when she decided to leave. 

I just think it's worrying to read about all these people struggling but we rarely know if they're actually getting help for it. I know it's their personal lives but I wonder what the overall view on it is in the industry (and in South Korea in general)?

My study involves examining competitiveness and fandom wars among international K-Pop fans. Your answers would add to the growing literature on the impact of the Hallyu wave outside of Korea.

Since this has to be a proper thread, I suppose we can further discuss the topic here as well! I guess to answer one of the survey questions (what values/beliefs inform fandom war practices): I personally think that when a fan's identity is even more entrenched into who their fandom/idol is, that competitive response comes out much stronger than say someone a little less invested into K-Pop. Saying it now, it seems obvious haha but I'm not here to talk about my opinions... I'm here for your thoughts!",38,64

Some of my favorites in recent memory are:

* [NCT Dream doing the most obvious spoiler playing around with the Korean for Go () and pretending nothing happened, then Haechan literally doing the choreo and getting beat up for it lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3V0T_BTFu4)

* [Sana doing the point move for Likey ""accidentally""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-DauqGWI0)

* [So far we have this from Dahyun as a spoiler for their new comeback lmao](https://twitter.com/dubootie/status/973885024222158848)

Feel free to say whatever you want  but remember, we wanna have fun, so while youre allowed to be critical and maybe harsh, please remember to be respectful. Please leave a score between 1 and 10 alongside your review for the song. If a song has an [MV] tag, you can review both the song and the music video! 

I dont pick the songs  theyre all randomly picked! If I do pick songs, I will explicitly state so  in which case I will right now: I picked Some to be on Jukebox this week! It was a big song of 2014 and I dont think its as well-remembered as other 2014 songs, but its just as good as other 2014 releases and is a lovely duet! _You can review songs up to this Friday at 8:00 PM PST_  this isnt a very hard deadline, but please try to get your reviews in before then!

She's regularly praised for her singing skills however what stands out the most about her is the ability she has at conveying emotion. Give her a sad song and she'll break your heart. She did a cover version of Hi.Ni's [Can't Have You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fdq7TmEtG4) which will have you feeling a lump in your throat by the end. She's the best when it comes to interpreting a sad song. 

Park Ki Young. I wish I could find more sad songs in her repertoire because the following [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ZSPleabTI&amp;index=36&amp;list=RDEMKjVmTES3eyUjrJAbE3O1lQ) is everything I want in a sad ballad.

2196,2018-3-26,2018,3,26,5,873cny,Cube launches CUBE TV Hangtime App,girlsnotgray,1522008763,"This was launched a few days ago, but it is available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiswe.hangtimeCubeTv&amp;hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/cube-tv-on-hangtime/id1325342442?mt=8)

Basically it allows you to watch different channels on CUBE TV including BTOB, CLC, and Hyuna - they're just live streams so you can't really pick a specific item to watch within those - and chat with people while watching. What I find most useful is the ""Private Hang"" where you can have a group chat with friends while watching something!

Also for BTOB fans, there's one channel dedicated to constantly streaming the last BTOB Time Concert *from 12 different camera angles* which means you can watch the entire concert on an HD member-specific cam if you want!",11,37

This means of course that the list is made up mostly of bigger girl groups but I wanted to put this here so that people can add more groups and their shows to it and let me know about any shows that I may have missed from the groups I have. This is only for girls groups and female solo artists because Im just more interested in them but if people want to add some male groups and shows that would be great. The female solo artists are just the ones I liked so I encourage people to add more to that part as well. I wanted to do this as a way I can watch at least some of these shows and get to know each of these groups. Sorry that the post is long but it is a lot of groups and solo artist. They are organized from earliest debuts to recent though there might be some mistakes.

INTRO: Spoiler by SHINee from the Dream Girl album. This song literally name dropped the entire tracklist for the Misconceptions of You series and still kept the lyrics pretty cohesive. This was a really unique way to lyrically introduce the series and capture the energetic sound of the album.  

OUTRO: Cool World by Red Velvet from The Red album. I like how this song really shows Red Velvet's progression through the album and the production sounds so smooth as well. They started off the album with songs like Dumb Dumb where they're nervous and anxious to talk to their crush as well as Red Dress where they want to wear a red dress to seduce their crush and look like their ideal type. But in this song, I like how they've gotten more confident in themselves and want to wear and do things that will make them happy first before thinking about their crush.",66,67

The Dancer - class experience with Eunhyuk, Taemin, etc.",kpopomo,1522213666,"Hi all, I don't use reddit much but was suggested to post here as well (I'd posted my experience on a FB group). Hope you all enjoy my experience on Sunday March 25 where I got to take a dance class from my favorite kpop idols!

(Side note: I'm a huge SJ fan so the post might be a little more Eunhyuk-focused, apologies about that!)

Teachers: Lia Kim (1Million), Super Junior Eunhyuk, Shinee Taemin, Highlight Gikwang, NCT Dream Jisung

Choreography to songs they taught: Lia Kim taught Gashina - shes a teacher at 1Million, so taught very well, and spoke fluent English. When she was teaching, Hyuk, Taemin, Gikwang and Jisung ran in the back of the studio (next to me!) to be students and learn the choreo. Except they were being filmed the whole time and Taemin and Hyuk are NOISY students lol! They kept imitating Lia teaching the accent part making hmph sounds. I tried hard to concentrate in class, but it was a failed case with them beside me and me in the back of the studio too.

SJ Eunhyuk was second to teach. He taught Black Suit.and spoke all in Korean. He even said in Korean, You all can understand right? Im going to teach the song Black Suit and everyone said Yes in Korean lol. Hyuk did try to use English sometimes, like, And now lift then forgot the word for foot and would say foot in Korean. And he taught the hardest part of Black Suit all in one go repeating it quickly due to time constraints, so not a lot of people were able to follow. (I know the Black Suit choreo thankfully otherwise I wouldnt have been able to follow). Even Taemin who was standing near me said ""Hard!"" in Korean. He said in Korean after, Ah, I should have taught Sorry Sorry instead (Lia Kim translated for him), and had everyone that knew that choreo come up and do it with him.

Shinee Taemin taught Move. He taught MUCH slower than Eunhyuk. Choreo was also much simpler than Black Suit too. He talked about keeping your energy in for the entire choreography, which really helped me understand it as a dancer. Easy choreo, but its hard to make it look likewell how he dances it! Hes always smiling and checking to see if he needed to repeat anything for us.

Highlight Gikwang taught the choreo to one of his solo songs (a hidden track that I dunno the name of, sorry). Gikwang was also a good teacher - I dont even remember if he taught in English or Korean but he did the moves to cleanly and repeated it a lot that no translation was needed.

NCT Dream Jisung didnt teach, but performed the choreo to one of their songs. Im not familiar with NCT Dream songs, but the rest of the students in class apparently were, so everyone sang along while he danced.

At the end, Lia Kim asked all of us which choreo we knew best, and asked us to go with that teacher to dance with them. I went with Eunhyuk, and stood right behind him as he went through the choreography. As I mentioned before, I knew it already so just danced to it when he did but the other students did not and kept asking him to do it slowly. The director came to call that part of class quits and just to gather around so the idols can dance their pieces in front of us. While Taemin was dancing to Danger, Ian Eastwood (choreographer for Danger) snuck into class and surprised Taemin. Ian freestyle to Danger and Eunhyuk, realizing this was shocked lol.

That was the end of class. As we filed out, some girls ran to Taemin, so I took the opportunity to run to Eunhyuk and give him a small gift I prepared for him and Donghae. I had to repeat it twice because I dont think he understood me, but understood when I said again, You and Donghae, and he smiled and said thank you to me. I asked him if I could take a photo with him, and he said yes, so I took out my phone for a selfie, but one of the crew members ran to us to almost hit me in the nose to stop me. I said bye to Eunhyuk and ran out of class after that, completely on Cloud 9.",18,295

Recently I have been enjoying Mamamoos [Starry night](https://youtu.be/LjUXm0Zy_dk). Ive also been interested in the hullaballoo about its relationship to [Prayer in C](https://youtu.be/fiore9Z5iUg).

What has interested me has been less the legal or quasi-legal question of whether this is a case of plagiarism  the answer, I think, is no  but rather some more general questions about kpop and originality.

* Prayer in C clearly loomed large in the minds of those creating Starry Night. What other examples are there of kpop that are clearly inspired by, but not plagiarized from, particular songs?

* Is kpop any more derivative than western pop? 

* How important is originality in our evaluation of kpop, and how important should it be? If kpop is, in fact, more derivative than western pop, might that not prompt us to reconsider the value we assign to originality?

Im not sure about these matters, so Id be grateful if you could help me think this through.

2508,2018-3-29,2018,3,29,15,87yyw8,What are some of the worst injuries/diseases for kpop idols that you have seen?,TheSunNeverCame,1522303470,"   Following Hwall's recent surgery, I thought it would be nice to discuss this because so many kpop idols deal with injuries/diseases/conditions/illnesses/accidents. A lot of injuries tend to stem from practicing, albeit a sprain or injuring something internal due to over practicing, I do find that many injuries come from practicing. 

I wanted to share what I personally think are the 3 worst injuries/diseases for kpop idols thus far. I've tried to explain these with simplicity. 

**1. The Boyz - Hwall - Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction.**
 I made this post because of what happened to Hwall.  This was caused due to an injury that tore the tendon or over intensive exercise that overtime weakened and broke the tendon. Basically this is a condition where a core tendon in your leg becomes inflammed or tears, this tendon runs all the way down to the middle of the foot and injuring this tendon causes your foot to lose support in its arch and force a flat foot. This can usually heal itself with proper rest and medication **if it is inflammed**. **If it is torn or isn't self healing, surgery is required** which is what Hwall needed. Hwall's surgery required the damaged tendon getting removed and replaced by another tendon. [I gave a more detailed explanation on Hwall's injury/surgery here](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_boyz/comments/87rlvm/explaining_hwalls_injurysurgery/) if you'd like to look into it. 
Note : The company said Hwall will return in 3 months, however the reality of this condition is that a full recovery will be 12 - 24 months. 



**2. Nct Dream - Jaemin - Herniated Disk**
This was a problem dating back to Jaemin's trainee days, likely from over practicing. Basically a herniated disk is a slipped disk commonly in the spine where the inner/sensitive part comes out of the exterior of the disk. Doctors usually give this condition a wide 6 week - 1 year range of healing because the body goes into a process of **resorption** *this is when the body will absorb the extruding material back in again.* If it doesn\t heal naturally surgery is needed to remove the disk (which carries many risks) but thank god Jaemin didn't need that. However it was unfortunate that Jaemin basically went into hiatus for a year for this condition. [If you'd like to read a little more in depth on a herniated disk go here](https://www.healthline.com/health/herniated-disk#treatment)




**3. EXID - Solji - Hyperthyroidism**
A condition more common in females because of an excess in production of hormones in the thyroids (thyroids are hormone producing glands in the neck) This increase causes significantly increased metabolism that causes extreme weight loss, rapid heart beats and fevers. If not treated properly, this disease can go on to further damage parts such as the bones and heart and put them in life threatening conditions. Solji did suffer from this and had to go through **orbital decompression surgery** to remove parts of her eye sockets. The eye sockets had to be removed because of her protruding/bulging eyes caused by hyperthyroidism. The eye socket walls would constrict the room in her eye and potentially cause blindness if the optic nerve gets squished for too long. Solji is still recovering from this and it's been more than a year ;/. [Read more on hyperthyroidism here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20373659)


Sorry for overtalking xD, I felt really bad with these 3 cases especially and wanted to help people to comprehend them better.

**Notes:**

* (formerly) Stellar's Gayoung doesn't have a YouTube account, but [she does have a VLive](http://channels.vlive.tv/D854DB/video) were she continues her radio show. 
* SNSD's Hyoyeon is presumably [the owner of this account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy09Uze1QeJPWycuOMPhjsw), but it has not been confirmed yet.
* [\(formerly\) Sistar's Hyolyn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJofNT5w33_mycys970x8g/featured?disable_polymer=1) also has an account, but it seems to be more for solo promotions rather than a vlog style channel. 
* In the ""related channels"" list on Dahee's account, there seems to be other girls who took part in Idol School, but since I didn't watch it, I'm not sure who's who. 
* [F\(x\)'s Luna](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06v2Mqte9cfn-3SMwpvFUA) has her own channel, but I'm not sure if it's a vlogging channel per se (as opposed to something more like an official ""show"" type thing). Can anyone clarify?",54,153

I translate kpop songs that might be less popular that doesn't get translated. I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation.

Be back in 48 hours to check!",5,18

I'm new to the Kpop world and am trying to figure out how similar Dispatch is to the paparazzi in the West. I've seen videos of celebs willingly posing for Dispatch a few times while on a trip to the airport and at the end of it, they bow so deeply. Afaik, this is a huge sign of respect. Some threads I've seen, Dispatch clearly breaches celebs' privacy (i.e. taking photos of celebs' phone screens) and others, can see fans definitely hating on Dispatch. So, what gives...? Is Dispatch the only paparazzi agency in Korea? Is it a reliable source for news? Appreciate y'all shedding light for a newbie! ",20,67
