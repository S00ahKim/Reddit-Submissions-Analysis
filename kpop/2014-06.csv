&gt;Lee Seung Chul will be releasing the song I Must Be in Love for You Are All Surrounded. The song was played on May 29s broadcast of the drama and is already gathering much attention.

&gt;I Must Be in Love is **originally sung by Kim Junsu and is included in his solo album, Incredible**, released in 2013. It has been remade with Lee Seung Chuls voice for the drama.

--- 
Today:

C-JeS allowed the use of the song to be recovered. **BUT** The song was broadcasted and not officially released and articles were written claiming that Lee Seung Chul's new OST song was his and **NOT** Kim Junsu's.

Part of the agreement w/ the production company (SBS) were to release the information regarding the original singer for the OST but did not meet the requirements. 

OST Producer and SBS PR have apologize and promised to re-release articles saying it was  Kim Junsus **but no articles have been corrected nor released.** Also to note C-JeS **has no ownership over the song all rights are under Kim Junsu's Name according to Korean Music Rights Association** SBS has remained silent since then.

I contacted them and they got it all resolved, but I just got my album in the mail and they sent two of them. I sent them a message about it, but they just said to keep it, so, as I've been doing whenever I get an extra album for any reason, I'll be giving it away here.

Rules:

* All you have to do to enter is post here. Doesn't matter what you post, it'll enter you in the drawing ( though it'd be kind of cool to have everyone share why they like 4minute, to make it a little more fun!). Everyone can only be entered once. I would ask that if you're posting and don't actually want the album, specify that.

* Winner will be asked to pay shipping. I'll ship it to anywhere in the world, but when it leaves I will send the winner a photo of the reciept so that they know how much shipping cost. I'm happy to give this away, but I kinda don't want to pay to give it away.

* Winner will be decided by a random die roll.

* Entries must be posted *before* 12:00PM CST on Thursday, June 5. I will draw later that day.

101,2014-6-5,2014,6,5,3,27b9mb,Why is there a need for a distinction between K-pop and Korean music?,sophomore9,1401907153,"There seems to be some animosity regarding 'K-pop' as people refer it to mainstream, mindless, bubble gum tunes with lots of gimmick.

However, idols like Big Bang members explore different music styles which aren't always radio friendly and acoustic musician Eddy Kim who went on a popular casting show has some really radio friendly tunes, just to give an example.

With K-pop / Korean music being a small niche in the music industry, isn't it better to not put Korean music against each other but rather spread the enjoyment of music that comes from Korea under one name? I'm just curious.

***
EDIT to say thanks for all your input.

While most argument that K-pop is a genre that is part of Korean music, no one could deny that K-pop itself encompasses genres. Moreover, no one can say where to draw the line to distinct if it's the one or the other.

As an example, a song can be a Korean rap song just as much as it can be a popular Korean song.

Drawing from personal experience, I was once introduced to a Korean singer by a Korean friend. We even heard her song play in a Caf once, so she is popular enough to get airplay but you wouldn't find her music outside of Korea. Made me think that what is considered popular or not is rather subjective. What we have access to outside of Korea might be all popular music from the viewpoint of a Korean who lives in Korea.

Anyways, thanks for the interesting discussion!",22,9

I'll start. I have 2 that both come to mind (Both from the same company coincidentally)

* Lee Hong Ki from FT Island - Something about his voice I can't really pinpoint it. whether it's the emotional delivery or something else; It's really easy for me to tell it's him when he sings.

* Shin Ji Min from AoA - I probably don't really need to explain this one. Nobody in kpop sounds anything like her. (At least that I've heard.)

I left some others out, I'm sure they'll get covered by other people though.",155,36

Two Wednesdays ago, I finally got a full time job after only working part time since the start of the year. I seriously started crying when I got it since I had been looking for ages. I was soo fucking happy that this job started the next Wednesday, as it meant I had time to go to Malaysia to watch 2NE1 on Saturday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The timing was PERFECT, and i knew I would regret if i didnt go.

I went on such short notice, it was the most ridiculous thing i've ever done.. I still can't believe I went all the way there for around 4 days just for a concert.. I saw more members of the YG Family than my own cousins LOL &gt;_&gt;

The concert was amazing!! I went CRAZY, I thought I would cry since I went by myself and no one could prove it, but I felt so much emotion that I couldn't (If that makes sense) like holy shit, I was seeing all four members in real life!!

Words can't express how grateful I've felt this past week. I got a new job and I got to see my favourite K-Pop group. I've loved them for years and went through a love/hate relationship when I waited 2 years for their new album. I dont think i'd show this kind of dedication 2NE1 else...One thing off my bucket list!

It's still sinking in that I actually went... I hope everyone gets an opportunity to go see their favourite musicians live, k-pop or not! EVERYBODY FOLLOW YOUR PASSIONS AND DREAMS WHATEVER THEY ARE!!!!





Highlights
------------

1: When waiting for 2NE1 to come out and everyone was singing along to their MV's... I got chills

2: CL PERFORMED MTBD!! I WENT FKN NOLJA CRAZY!! Cause i thought she wouldn't since Malaysia is a Muslim country and there was that controversy.

3: I was probably 3 metres from Minzy at one point.. so close but so far away lol.

4: The concert was well organised and started on time. I thought it would be a mess cause it was in Malaysia but I was pleasantly surprised, so props to them.





Pics - could of been better, was waving my lightstick lol and would rather enjoy myself than take videos the whole time!

I'm really sorry for bothering you with this constantly and I will understand if you dislike even though I kinda find it unfair as I do this charts for the community and I get absolutely no reward for my work, but here you have another KPOP Chart for June Week 1, you can now vote for your favorites so they can get a better place on the monthly charts. The rules of voting are in the description but I'll summarize them here

- You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 5 points to a single song.

Thanks for all those who check it and I'm sorry for bothering you..",7,21

I'm learning Korean and I'm trying to use K-POP to help me. I usually don't like K-POP with everything surrounding relationships etc.. but G-Dragon's song Crooked really caught me by surprise. The guy seemed like a badass in the video, and I was wondering if there are any artists/songs like this? Are songs like that uncommon? I'm so used to ""mushy"" Korean songs and I absolutely love this Korean counter-culture. Can any K-Poppers direct me of any alternative Korean artists that have this same style of counter culture?

Thanks so much,

June Week 2... what a fierce week! NINE new entries and an infinite battle for top 10! A total of TWENTY-SIX songs were considered by me for the top 10, so if a song is even on the chart I probably LOVE IT! What about the first place? Was Hyosung capable of keeping the first place, did a new song take first place, or were Vixx able to take first place back from Hyosung? Check this week's chart to find out! Congratulations to 2NE1 with Gotta Be You (Song with most votes last week) and Jiyeon with Never Ever (Song with the most total points from my personal chart + fan votes this last week!)

How to vote in a nutshell:

-You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 5 points to a single song.

Thanks for all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts!",0,19

**SUMMARY OF EVENTS LAST TIME:**

Congrats to the people who got 20/20! 

/u/moonbae, /u/kc501, /u/silversam, /u/almightylurker, /u/seihuunn, /u/thiswhovian, /u/ahgyussi, /u/dadeste, /u/blacksol273, /u/dyodoroo, /u/exoticshawol16

The most missed answer was [Hyunseong](http://38.media.tumblr.com/6fef036a573f65b4ae998f34d59f8f42/tumblr_mmgumuaC7U1rqd5g9o1_r1_500.png) from Boyfriend! Or as you guys like to call him, ""flower dude,"" ""pre debut Suho,""  ""...blooooop,"" ""joe,"" ""Hyunsehnnnnnnng,"" and ""guy from boyfriend. lol""

Side Note: If you did not get your results you most likely typed in your reddit name incorrectly. If you want you can PM me and I can try and find your results.

**WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW:**

This is the medium level test! This is part 2 out of the 3. The next test is going to be the ~~impossible~~ hard level. (It will be *really* hard).  Once again I will PM you your results as soon as possible (It takes time so be patient...I did it as fast as possible with the last one and I'll try and do the same this time too).Look forward to the next ones and enjoy!",29,23

616,2014-6-21,2014,6,21,23,28q1ub,How well can you name male idols? Part three,floating_around,1403361397,"[HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YxmI5rtJy4kp6CN08imKhO35bCvQ1DbYbK7AmX7rNqk/viewform) is the test-have fun! (I'm sorry it's really hard)

**SUMMARY OF EVENTS LAST TIME:**

100's go to: /u/Imnotlistening, /u/moonbae, /u/dadeste, /u/Exo-K, /u/hellovivienne, /u/Lunakitten, /u/Pyratist, /u/shadowxp, /u/hwangjanim, /u/kc501, /u/sliceofhamandcheese, /u/seonwoong, /u/silversam, /u/ch0ding, /u/infectmadagascar, /u/perirue, /u/thiswhovian.

The most missed answer was [E.co](http://kpopinfo114.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/jjcc-e-co-e1395197715400.jpg?w=627) of JJCC. But we decided to call him:

 ""G-Dragon as an old lady,"" ""GD on a bad day,"" ""some girl with short hair,"" ""old sungmin,"" ""EW,"" ""Thin sungmin,"" ""Gdragon cosplayer,"" ""korean man,"" ""fake GD,"" or ""Dongho gone bad...he needs chapstick"" 


**WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW:**

I made two tests in preparation of you for this one...the final test of your male idol knowledge!! (or it might not be the last one I might make more lol) But this one is BY FAR the hardest and if you can actually get these then...wow. 

**LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE:**

On Monday I will be posting the first of the female idol version of these! (I already have it done-just have to post it!) It will be in three parts just like this one (and the first one will *actually* be easy.) After I am done with those 3 I would love to make more quizzes for y'all because I have a lot of fun making them and reading all of your responses. Also  based on your feedback it seems like you like these too! So what I'm asking for you is what kind of quizzes do you want to see? I could do themed name the idol ones (Blonde hair, profiles, lips, butts...) I could make quizzes on naming all of the members of one specific group (putting a group photo up, you name the members in order) or I could do something just testing your knowledge of kpop with multiple choice questions (ie How many dogs does SHINee's Key own?) OR I could do something else based on what you guys want...my only requirement is that it needs to be relatively easy-but don't be afraid to suggest something that might take a little effort!",32,11

Actually, it's one of my hidden pleasures since I pretty much adore the genre and the style (clothes, look, videoclips' flow) behind it.  
After a while, I started to get curious about Block B and Big Bang live performances and here's the thing: although you can see and hear, sometimes, the group actually singing, how much of the live performance is actually live when it comes to singing?  
We all know that they are capable of singing properly (they had to record at least the song one time) but why always put the same show and choreography when they could simply do a bit better to perform 100% live?",19,20

June Week 3 we finally have a normal amount of new entries on the chart! (7) but those 7 came with all strength and achieved good places on the chart, was one of them capable of reaching first place and stop Vixx from Winning? Or was Wheesung, Infinite or BoBGirls capable of it instead? Check the chart to find out! Shout out to 2NE1's Gotta Be You who achieve the most points from fans last week and to Vixx's Eternity and Infinite's Last Romeo that achieved the most points in general last week. Only 1 more week until I start making the monthly chart! :D

How to vote in a nutshell:
-You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 5 points to a single song.
Thanks for all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts!

Which idol is that? This is not meant to put anyone down.

Okay, so if I'm able to go, this will be my first time going. I will be with my friend, and it will also be my first time in California.

I'm deciding to try to go sort of last-minute, but I need to really think about saving money and all that. So, when do you think should be the latest I can maybe buy my ticket? I'm planning on getting the P1 pass, and I heard they can go real quick.    I can afford to get it in 4 weeks, so I just don't want to lose my chance to get it.


Also, who else is going? I would like to greet some of y'all there. ^.^

Now, because I realized that making a 'real name only' requirement was kind of stupid I went back and found the people that got 19/20 because they put Dia instead of Kim Jieun. Here they are:

/u/arbegla2x8x5x, /u/ImNotListening, /u/CB_Softie, /u/TinyShell, /u/alastion, /u/d0uble0h, /u/Mayatong, /u/melgee, /u/ssaranghae, /u/indecisivemonkey, /u/moonbae, /u/narfics, /u/ghount, /u/omgdanny, /u/markoseke, /u/fanfanye, /u/girls_degeneration, /u/mfisdead, /u/TheFishii.

This is the last part guys! Yayyy! After this one I will be taking a break from making these for a little bit. After making 6 quizzes, putting them out every other day and giving results out in that time frame I'm pretty damn tired lol. This will definitely not be the last quiz so don't worry :) I'm still in the market for new ideas so don't be afraid to say them! Because a lot of you were wondering if you could do the old quizzes that I'd closed I'm going to be making a post here on Sunday that has links to all of them. They will be open for around 24 hours and I will NOT be pm-ing results but I will be posting answer keys along with them! And lastly I would like to say thank you for everyone who took the time out of their day to do these quizzes [&lt;3](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m714ep9ZhS1qhmeygo1_500.gif)

What do you guys think about it? Personally, I'm upset. There's already a lot of male groups coming to KCON so I was expecting a girl group reveal, but instead, it's 2 more male groups and a male solo. I'm even more upset because when they were teasing one of the lineup reveals, they gave us a hint: ""angels"" and then they started making angel wings. Obviously as a male kpop fan, I thought it'd be AOA, but it turned out to be Teen Top. welppppp....




Anyways, more lineup reveals will be coming in the next few days before tickets go on sale, so hope for your favorites!",21,27

The dancing scenes are divided with dark and light themes and takes place in an area with a platform and pillars. The story for the video is (I think) a stereotypical tale of a break up.

Inspired by South Korea's infamous university entrance exam [CSAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Scholastic_Ability_Test), I have made a quiz in which the majority of you will be lucky to identify more than three idols correctly. For the few who think they will ace the test anyway, see this as a rewarding exercise for the hard work you have put into nugu-chasing over the last few years.

Since I doubt anyone will be able to correctly identify all 20 idols, I will list the top 5 participants regardless of how many points they have scored. Good luck.

You should all be receiving a personalized message containing your score soon. 

If you wish to make your own K-pop quiz using the same format, you may want to use this __[little Python script](https://gist.github.com/schrobby/c53f65d16998e9cd7ab6)__ (requires PRAW, doc will be up soon) I wrote up to automatically evaluate a CSV spreadsheet from Google Drive.

EDIT: There seems to be a misunderstanding as to whether #18 is Jiyul or Ahyoung. Since it's not really clear (despite the image saying  in the corner), I am going to count both as valid, and have since re-adjusted the top 10 score board.

June Week 4 and again we have 7 new entries! And 3 of them spawning in incredible places! Was one of them actually able of taking first place back from AOA? Big Shoutout to AOA's Short Hair who got a PERFECT score last week (1st place in my chart and 1st place in fan chart!), I'll bring news to you soon, don't forget to vote! Its the last chance this month.

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 5 points to a single song. Thanks for all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts!
