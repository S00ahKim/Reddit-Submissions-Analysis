51,2019-7-1,2019,7,1,15,c7pcg7,My review of DNA by BTS,Indiematic_alt,1561964179,"We all know about K.Pop Stans right? Well, I liked their obsession over their favourite bands, but I always judged the genre too harshly, so I sat down and Listened to A Bunch Of Circles And Lines (DNA) by BTS!

Out of the gate, there was too much style and too little substance, I was assuming the song would just be whistling, but all the colours made it look like a JoJo intro! Right after that it actually cut to some instrumentation, but the cast looked strange. There were too many people for it to be a band, and judging by their looks I thought I was watching the twink category on PornHub Gay! After frantically clearing the search history, I realized it was just YouTube. After that it was just more whistling and repetitive percussion, until the vocalist came on, but something was off, He was fucking mumbling! That's right, these boys thought it wasn't worth talking coherently over the goddamned STUDIO VERSION! It was bland regardless of coherence, until another guy came on, who was also a singer. That's right, these string bean dicklet motherfuckers ripped off The Beatles by having two vocalists, and the dumbass sheep population didn't even notice! This guy was singing with more energy, but it didn't feel energizing. But then, there was a disgusting appropriation with not the first, not the second, but the BITCH ASS THIRD vocalist! He was rapping, even though they're all Asian. Silly Asians, rapping is for black people. Right after that, there was a flavourless vocal hook, which sounded like it was autotuned to high hell! The absolute balls, the sizable testicles, the extremely massive gargantuan nuts of these Asian Twinks to actually use AUTOTUNE in music, in a furious rage of all the abhorrent shit I talked about until now I stopped listening!

In conclusion, K.Pop is a plague and BTS are the rats! K.Pop is reason enough to nuke Korea! The only solution to the K.Pop problem is for the president to use all of the nukes he has and to target them all towards both Koreas, and assblast the shit out of those two shitholes!

## FLOOR C ROW 27

### PRE-CONCERT TIPS

-	Upgrading Tickets is super useful in Ticketmaster. I only knew about it due to a FB group chat and usually get hesitant to take action or changing anything because Im clumsy af and Im afraid I mess up.

-	I was originally in Row 107 but transferred to nearby the extended stage on lefthand and didnt regret an ounce of it. They were super nice about it and only had to pay $10 fee but remember that original and new seat must be same price!

-	Scotia Bank Arena was the largest venue so far so I was intimidated. There were two lines outside for merch. One for lightsticks and another for lightstick + merch which made the buying process more efficient. Buy batteries in case they run out! I had to buy it from nearby grocery for like $10 CAD.

## CONCERT EXPERIENCE 

-	Seeing them irl is pretty much surreal since the closest I got to them is usually 4k fancams. They actually have really good proportions and they were only standing.

-	Youngjaes voice is so powerful especially in performing high notes. It was so pleasing to hear and it was not jarring at all. I was really surprised with the intense choreo, he did not falter or show any struggle

-	Yugyeoms solo was pretty much amazing. I dont know how he does it but every time he dances, he makes beautiful, flowing and continuous moves with power. He had great charisma

-	Jackson, Bambam and Mark had pretty good energy when doing their raps. Its amazing to see them continuously improving. Also their visuals are undeniably ethereal. All of the members in Got7 visuals are just striking and makes you really think that they are born to be idols

-	Especially Jinyoung, I watched his recent drama and Im always in awe with his visuals. Seeing him in real life, I couldnt stop closing my mouth in awe. His visual features are chiseled and defined which can be intimidating at first but then when he talks, he just seems calm and oozing with charisma.

-	For JB, as a leader, he was really cute when trying to communicate with aghases. The fact that he tries speaking english is such a wonderful thing. His performance is unreal too, i literally cannot differentiate him from cd and live audio. He just seems so professional and its hard to falter

-	As a side note, what I really like about GOT7 is they are goofy and hilarious af. They are not afraid to tease each other and its really nice to see this unrestricted relationship. You can really see this kind of vibes with their performance too. In the end, they end up running around with the water bottles and blessed that holy got7 water to aghases. The background dancers were goofy too and JB interactions with them are so cute.

-	Overall, whats nice about Got7 concert performance is they always bring something new to the table. They have a large discography and that nostalgic feeling of hearing it is irreplaceable. They also mostly have self-produced and remixed songs so every time they perform, it always looks and sounds fresh rather than being stale

-	I just want to thank GOT7 and staff for promising and willing to come back to Toronto again!

People know what it is, but they mock the genre and the people who support it. It's been two years since I've started listening to KPOP and I have to say those years were life-changing. Korean pop really changed my perspective on dancing, singing and the work that goes behind developing skills in general. I started appreciating and admiring life more! It was really depressing that I had no one to share these thoughts with...That is what I have been trying to change the past year. I had the idea one day to mix wester kind pop/trap/RnB music with KPOP dances and show it to people that are not into KPOP at all. The looks on their faces were impressive, to say the least. It was the first time I saw them smile at KPOP but not in a \*yikes\* kind of way. That's why I decided to open up a youtube channel dedicated to this idea. The channel will probably not be able to be monetized due to copyright, but if it ends up generating any money I will make sure to give most of it back to the community in the form of albums/merch/lightsticks e.t.c.Any form of support is greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlE9dYRDUdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlE9dYRDUdI) 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Channel Goals\*

&amp;#x200B;

Main: Make people respect and view KPOP in a whole new way.

&amp;#x200B;

Extras:

&amp;#x200B;

1)Entertain KPOP fans

&amp;#x200B;

2)Change fans perspective on certain dances

&amp;#x200B;

3)Make dancing to KPOP less awkward/more fun (for international fans)

&amp;#x200B;

4)If the channel ends up getting any traction it could be used as a tool to promote smaller artists like vocalists and dancers that did not make it into a big label. (Both Korean and not)

&amp;#x200B;

Schedule: New mix every Monday/Wednesday/Friday for the first month at least.

P.S. If there is anything you find offensive/disrespectful please contact me either via youtube comments or Instagram(@kmixent).

Thank you for your time!",1,3

Those eye to eye moments with the members made me blush and gush since they have pretty much acknowledged my existence. And the crowd made me experience a sense of belonging (so that's a check from Maslow and my hierarchy of needs). Everything felt surreal even though it was a dream come true

&amp;#x200B;

Then everything changed when reality attacked  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I read a [related post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3oejd6/im_experiencing_postconcert_depression_need_some/) 3 years ago. And it included doing my hobbies like cooking, drawing, and playing sports. So, I tried exercising, but now my body is now as sore as my feelings lmao. As a result, I don't feel like moving as much. I'm wondering if you guys have another angle that you did to combat this type of roller coaster of emotions 

&amp;#x200B;

I also wonder if it's better to 

A. Watch Twice content to make me feel satisfied and relive the magical night again (but get overwhelmingly sad again like a cruel loop) or

B. Cleanse myself from anything Twice related as of the moment (but miss them in the process even though I never met them) 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks guys, I need to move on",12,6

Like there would be an topic getting traction, and someone would say one line related to that topic then post an unrelated fancam in the same comment. When the Scooter Braun drama with Taylor Swift happened yesterday and you clicked on the trend, it was literally all Kpop fancam spam and it was hard to see what was going on.

I think it makes Kpop look really bad. If it was just one group, I would have thought it was just one fandom or another fandom trying to make that group look bad, but theyre multiple groups. Im just trying to understand where this trend started, and why people spend their time doing this.",1,0

NOTE: I AM ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE GROUPS I KNOW, SO IM SORRY IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR FAVES HERE.


*2018 rookies*


LOONA // to be honest, although I don't Stan them THAT hard, I think they should have won ROTY. The girls are so freaking talented when it comes to Singing and dancing, but I feel they need to work on rapping.


(G)-idle // non arguably my favorite rookie group of 2019. I love how much they've don't in the short time that they've been a group, even doing a collab with LoL! Another thing I love is Soyeon's rap skills! (But then again, Cube is really good at making amaizing female rappers so it's kinda expected)


*2019 rookies*

Cherry Bullet // The first group that I stanned before debut! Their unique videogame concept is just.. amazing!! Plus, I think they have a lot potential to be honest!


Itzy // Even though I kinda like Dalla Dalla, it seemed not just the mv, but the songs itself had one to many things in it. On the plus side, despite their jump choreography, they are very stable live!


TXT // I don't have much to say about them since I just get t into their discography, but their title tracks are great, but I can't help to wonder, why are the lyrics in ""Cat &amp; Dog"" so stupid? 


Everglow // I love their debut song (bon bon chocolat), but to me it feels that they have little to no emotion when they sing? I like them a lot, hope for the best.",59,12

Whether it be a comeback, a performance, an article, an event, etc, what has been your favourite moment of 2019 right now?

While this may not count as an individual moment itself, my favourite moment of 2019 right now has been the debuts of so many talented groups and soloists, such as AB6IX, Cherry Bullet, Everglow, Hwasa, ITZY, Somi, Sungwoon and TXT, just to only name a couple.

You'll probably say 'stop listening then', but the songs are so good that I keep coming back to them. Every time I come back, I get more depressed. I'm getting stuck in a cycle that has no way out.

After some research I get the gist that its because people have been labelling her as a ""koreaboo"" because of not having any Korean heritage/ background. Has she done something in the past to further outrage people?   


I also would like to ask, why Korean idols are heavily defended when they wear ""Corn rows""  despite not having any black heritage. But Lana who has adopted a ""Korean look"" is met with so much backlash

~~I'm not sure when exactly each era started and ended, so I might've placed some songs in the wrong generations, but I know all the artists/groups they belong to debuted in those eras.~~


**First generation:** The The Band - [ ](https://youtu.be/p_S07zOaQeg)^(English title is 'Little Bird' according to Google Translate)  
I discovered this K-rock band (who have been active since 1997, though only one member of the original lineup remains) while searching for more information about Heejung Han, one of my favorite K-indie singers (who I highly recommend if you like Dalsooobin and Exid's Solji, she kind of sounds like a mixture of the two.) Turns out she was apart of two groups in the past, The The Band being the first. She was the vocalist throughout 2001 and 2003 and in that timeframe they released two pretty solid albums, my favorite obviously being the one including ' '.  
The vocals are obscurely mixed, which might be a turn off unless you're familiar with and as much as a fan of shoegaze as I am, where that kind of vocal mixing is a staple. But what I find the most worthy of praise is the chorus, it gives me chills everytime, especially the way Heejung says 'I don't wanna cry'.  
**Honorable mentions:** The The Band - [You said](https://youtu.be/JISN-nerZfc) (_Radiates the same energy as Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls._) &amp; [ ](https://youtu.be/r19kMiV3QKk)^(Apparently means 'A Hidden Dream') (_From their debut album. My mother said this sounds like something that would play at the end of a John Hughes film or at a prom in the '80s, both of which I can totally picture!_)  
Uhm Junghwa - [Invitation](https://youtu.be/SF8YrEUq_IA) (_Aged like fine wine...this could be released today by someone with a sexy image like Sunmi and it'd be as much as a hit as it was back then!_)  
BoA - [No.1](https://youtu.be/ceZc-5p3g1w) &amp; [Valenti](https://youtu.be/qwNz_anqd2U)  
CSJH The Grace - [Dancer in the Rain](https://youtu.be/ecb4yF8aajU)  
Jewelry - [Superstar](https://youtu.be/79UaTOmopi4)  
Lee Jung Hyun - [Wa!](https://youtu.be/ME3b9a1FoAQ) &amp; [Peace](https://youtu.be/VpQ4jSSXy_c)


**Second generation:** IU - [Last Fantasy](https://youtu.be/AWtwkrGpp4w)  
Everyone knows IU, but only those who are Truly Blessedt know the majestic, enchanting track that is titled after her 2nd full length album released in 2011. It is six glorious minutes of miss Lee Ji ~~eun~~ geum (=gold) singing like a whole Disney princess, elevated by a grand orchestra. It is a song that will always have a special place in my heart.  
**Honorable mentions:** IU - [Lost Child](https://youtu.be/0ZukHxqOA0o) (_The birth of a legend_)  
Brown Eyed Girls - [Cleansing Cream](https://youtu.be/PSKRffDyWog) (_This the song I go to when my ears need cleansing._)  
JeA - [While You're Sleeping](https://youtu.be/xQ_6w7qJSr8) (_I cannot believe this song isn't more well known..._)  
Sunny Hill - [Pray](https://youtu.be/Uive4DMqAdc)  
Seungyeon of Kara - [Guilty](https://youtu.be/2_WIuI5VZKA)  
Kara - [STEP](https://youtu.be/zYoYoBtLqOY) (_The styling in the M/V needs to GO...but the song can always stay in my playlist._)  
SNSD - [Genie](https://youtu.be/6SwiSpudKWI)  
9Muses - [Ticket](https://youtu.be/_aOq_1T8XY0) (_""TICKET ONE WAY TICKET ONE WAY ONE WAY ONE WAY ONE WAY TICKET"" is iconic_)



**Third generation:** Red Velvet - [One of these Nights](https://youtu.be/9xWiro_tS1k)  
How this is one of their least popular title tracks I will never understand. This is the first song of theirs I heard that I liked upon first listen. This is the song that showed me Kpop has much more to offer than just colorful pop-y dance music, compelling me to delve deeper into not only Kpop but Korean music in general. This is a song that will never grow old.  
I wish I could personally thank everyone involved in the creation of this masterpiece (including the M/V)  
**Honorable mentions:** Ha:tfelt - [Ain't Nobody](https://youtu.be/oQT82EOXX7c) (_Makes me want to cry and dance at the same time_) &amp; [Peter Pan](https://youtu.be/x9kRQu4jFqU) (_Her highnotes will send you to neverland_)

however, when i watched [miss a's breathe (dance version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16sfLHXAASU) video, i realized i was missing out on something good. the song was catchy, the choreography was great and the members were full of charms and were charismatic performers. that's when i fell into the rabbit hole. i learned the choreographies, i listened to their discographies, i watched variety shows, and i damn well enjoyed it.

now most of the songs i listen to are in korean (kpop, indie, ballads, hiphop, you name it), and it's been 7 years since i started becoming a fan of kpop and listening to music without prejudice.",69,97

In my time in the kpop fandom, I have obviously seen things/topics/songs/groups be very polarizing. 

But what are the ones that no one seems to debate? For instance, I'll see debate between DBSK/SJ/BB for kings of 2nd gen, but I rarely see it brought up that anyone is on SNSD's level (and I could be wrong on this, I know people are very passionate about Brown Eyed Girls, Wonder Girls, or 2NE1, so let me know). Or IU being universally loved. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything negative said about her.

I guess my question is: What song, dance, group, soloist, performance, MV, etc. seems to be either universally loved or universally considered at the top?",33,0

We met a few weeks ago when I went to Korea, with another two of my friends. 
That night we decided to go clubbing and we wanted to enjoy our night so we got a VIP section at the club. 

A couple of guys were interested in us, spoke to us, but one caught my eye and it was him. We made eye contact a few times and I was instantly attracted to him. 

I didnt think of it much because guys at the club jump from one girl to another so, I brushed it off my shoulder.

Then later, me and my friends went for another round of drinks at our booth (VIP section) and to my surprise he came over.

At first I didnt know who he was. However, he looked familiar. He started speaking, my friends got the hint and left us two to talk. We instantly clicked, he was actually really sweet. That night we did kiss but he didnt make anymore moves, but we exchanged numbers.

A couple of days go by and he invited me out to have dinner at a hotel. He made sure it was private enough so no one could tell who he was. 

We ate dinner and we got a bit drunk (thats what careless adults do) and we started walking to the hotel lobby. He stopped and looked at me, I looked at him to. (God he was so handsome) and we started making out, it got heated and he took me to his hotel room and we did it.

I actually didnt tell my friends about this night, I didnt tell anyone. I really wanted to tell someone about this but he told me not to and I dont want to cause trouble. 

But I feel like writing it here, not mentioning his name, its fine for me to do it right? Its not like anyone will believe me. 

He was good at it, he was amazing. We talk here and there but hes busy. 

I came back three weeks ago from Korea and I feel different.",3,0

I am a 17 year old straight boy and I think theres two parts of why its so bad for me. Im embarrassed to tell anyone, and I love these girls. 

It first started just watching the music videos and adding songs from groups like TWICE, AOA, Red Velvet, and G(I)-DLE. I watched these music videos for the next 3 weeks. A LOT. Id be playing League of Legends or Overwatch glancing over at my other monitor screen just to watch the part I knew was coming. Its not just that Im obsessed with the girls, I also love video editing so I can appreciate the time that goes into making these videos, and the songs are hype too so thats another plus. I told only my close friends that Im listening and watching as a teenage boy would do, because the girls are beautiful and because the songs were good. I think my addiction at this stage wasnt too bad yet as I was still mentally sane if that isnt too critical of how I am now. I was still playing games that I loved, talking to my friends, and watching normal videos that I usually watched on YouTube or before going to bed. 

I then branched off to watch clips of TWICE and only TWICE out of the popularity, just normal clips showing their true personalities. This was the step I took that made everything so much harder for me. I bought a subscription to Lingo Deer and took the first few lessons of Korean. I always knew I wanted to move somewhere in Asia, but not really Korea. Maybe Japan or somewhere else. I want to move there because of their culture and I find Korean or Asian girls in general really beautiful. 

I find my heart speeding up when watching videos, thinking about them, wherever I am. I just feel so dead inside that I cant ever meet them or talk to them. 

This was really hard for me to talk about, so Im sorry if i ranted. Im just really lost right now and could use some help.",0,1

Yesterday I spent the entire day listening to KPop and actually branching off to watch TWICE videos out of the music, like short clips and such. This didnt help me at all.

Jessica's vocals were fairly central to the harmonizing. When Girls Generation, you could easily point out Jessica among the line-up.

The excuse I read was Jessica was often busy with her merchandise and wasn't giving Girls enough focus yet it doesn't explain why after she left, she was black-listed in the industry. She was never invited back for TV programmes to promote her music, which is a death knell for singers in Kpop though Jessica was lucky enough to have built a niche which has allowed her music to consistently sell as well as her successful merchandise has made her rich. 

So I don't know of I necessarily think the reason for Jessica's dismissal was the one the Agency announced. I read a rumor the Agency resented Jessica's success overshadowing Tiffany's premiere single.",4,0

* When groups/soloists do *OVERLY* sexy concepts and choreography, it makes me cringe. 


* When groups have terrible English pronunciation in a song (for some reason, you don't see it now which is good)


* Ultra cute/aeyego (Sorry if misspelt). I see this with more girl groups than boy groups, but I find it equally cringey.

468,2019-7-4,2019,7,4,5,c8tezw,Did you got tired of the Kpop community over time and why?,Softdrive1,1562186823,"I personally got really tired of anything K-pop related except the music itself. 

I started in late 2015 with K-pop, was really obsessed, watched every Live-show, dance practice, Weekly Idol, read every discussion and watched a lot of VLive. I noticed how much time I wasted with watching all these things and how... well to be honest... how worthless it is for me. The fun I had wasn't the same as watching a drama or playing a game, it was kinda like a honeymoon-phase. Then I noticed those over the top reactions on shows, always acting so pure and the annoying overly emotional fans. (Complaints about some Idol having dread-locks, wtf) I also realized for me that almost every b-track is utter garbage and how hard they actually try to exploit me by my emotional bonds between the cute idols while the music is actually what should create emotions. I didn't waste money since I'm a born penny-pincher but I wasted ***a lot*** of time and looking back I do regret it. Like for real, I could have been much better at coding, it really was like a drug.

I've had my enlightenment almost a year ago, when I entered my second year at University and realized that I have to get my shit in life together and became a ''serious'' person. (K-pop was just the thing that gave me the last push) I've been wondering if there are people with the same experience.",51,0

475,2019-7-4,2019,7,4,8,c8v3c2,9Muses disbanded in February and it's arguably been the best thing to ever happen to them,ThaWhiplash,1562195434,"Seriously, screw Star Empire for keeping the girls locked away doing nothing for 2 years after Love City until their disbandment single. Of course, the disbandment was a painful and extremely sad experience for everyone but I think they've never been happier and have managed to continually provide us with new 9Muses content even though they're now ""officially"" disbanded. 

After 2 years of essentially radio silence we now get content practically everyday from the girls as OT8 is closer than ever and always together (barring Kyungri who still has schedules with Star so she isn't able to be with them as often.) 

Within less than half a year we've gotten: a 9Muses photo gallery exhibit where Moon, Sojin, Hyemi, and Minha put on a mini concert, Keumjo's gotten a role in a play and now a new drama, Sojin signing to an acting agency,  a Keumjo and Hyemi duo two-day mini-concert, a Minha birthday fan-meet that Sojin and Hyemi attended and helped with, a vacation trip to Thailand with Euaerin, Sungah, Hyemi, and Hyuna who all gave us constant updates and hilarious videos, and now the girls are selling us MERCH from their photo gallery exhibit. You can buy it [here](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=1632884691) and they're selling a photobook as well as a super nice bundle with a tote bag (which has now unfortunately sold out). 

Moon Hyuna, Euaerin, Minha, Kyungri, and Sojin are all frequently uploading new videos of their lives, as well as plenty of content and fun together as a group. The best part of almost all of their channels (still waiting on Kyungri..) have English subs. 

I know there wasn't really a point in this post rather than to just show the hopeful side to what we often consider to only be such a sad and horrible event. I guess the moral of the story is that while it can truly hurt to never get music from your favorite group again, disbandment can be a good thing for the groups stuck with some of the much smaller and arguably horrible companies. I think 9Muses is different from most groups in how close they are and that they're all practically best friends/sisters but if a group wants to stay together this shows that they can and will. 

Here is a plug for all of their youtube channels if you're interested in keeping up with the girls who still call themselves and each other Muses everyday :)

But every year they disappoint! Anyone else frustrated with this? Allot of people like to say thats its not KCONs fault because of artist schedules but We know thats bs! Theres plenty of Girl Groups out there and specially small girl groups who would love to come to the U.S. Others say its the lack of demand because Kpop fans are mostly girls. I dont think thats true anymore in sense that I see allot of girls into Girl Groups now.  I wish KCON would stop with the sexism and bring more girl groups to KCON. In NY they had only 4  girl groups and now their down to 3 after Everglow pull out because of the visas problem.  Anyone think this will change in the future?,16,1

Red Velvet: 
-Yeri/Seulgi: Just because I think their voices would work well together. Seulgi has a really powerful, more throaty voice, while Yeris is much lighter and more nasally. They would compliment each other well. Also, Yeri can rap. 

(G)-IDLE:
-Minnie/Yuqi/Shuhua (a.k.a. Foreign Line): As shown on Weekly Idol, Minnie and Yuqis voices go really well together. Both are great vocalists despite not having the Main Vocal role, and I think they strengthen each other by performing together. Shuhuas singing voice (though we unfortunately dont get to hear it often) has a dreamy quality similar to Minnies, and a mid-range tone that I think would blend nicely with the other two. 

BLACKPINK:
-Jennie/Lisa: I loved their collaborative rap in KTL, and really want to see them perform more together! They vibe really well of each other vocally and on stage, and I think they could create something really unique together. Both can rap, sing and dance. Its especially interesting to me since Jennies voice is much deeper and more powerful than Lisas, which I think would make a really pleasant contrast. 

-Jisoo/Ros: Both are great vocalists, but with different tones. And although both have a pretty decent range, Id love to hear something deeper-toned by the both of them! Their low registers give me goosebumps. Also Jisoo can rap fairly well and hearing her rap over Ross singing would be legendary.

Let me hear yalls opinions on both my selections and your bias groups!",73,32

Are there also any common/well known pairings found in your favourite groups' songs?

From my experience, this is usually found with rapper pairs, but vocalist pairs/dance pairs/any other pairs are very welcome!

Also, to be clear, I am talking about pairings within songs/MVs/performances-- basically settings which revolve around a song, rather than say, variety shows, irl friendships or ships.

647,2019-7-5,2019,7,5,15,c9cfdq,"LAYSHA: ""That"" KPop Group",snaccist,1562306483,"So since this is my first post, I would like to start off with a little rant. Today I will be discussing LAYSHA. These are ALL my opinions so before you guys come for my throat, hear me out. I don't hate the girls, but I can't get myself to like them, at all. Now that we have that out of the way, let's get started with this.

So who is LAYSHA? Well, they're a girl group formed by JS Entertainment, but have since moved to A1 Entertainment. They debuted with the self-titled single LAYSHA. The group has  5 members, Som, Goeun, Chaejin, Hayoung, and Sia. The group originally had 9 members, counting Hyeri, Seulgi,  Yoobin, and Choim Som is currently on a temporary hiatus due to health problems. Their debut was on May 12, 2015.

Now that we know who they are, we can talk. First, I'll explain why they are popular, and then discuss the problem, and double standards. Let's jump right in, shall we?

1. Why People Like Them
Every idol has a fanbase, and every fanbase has a reason for liking that idol. However, LAYSHA's fans only like them because they're a ""sexy"" group... how sad. Now before you come for my throat, let me explain. First, yes, I did watch videos and find out things about the group before I made this post, and I felt very unsettled, not gonna lie. And I looked at the comments and the only thing people were gushing about was how good and sexy they looked, nothing about the song or music. Just straight-to-your-face comments. Everything about the group disgusts me, and how JS just did that to them. I bet that JS was just using them. Maybe they had some say in the concept, but nothing else.

2. The Problem
So what's the problem? Well, the concept. Never have I ever seen such things in KPop before, I questioned if they even qualify as KPop. The girls are close to their 30s, and people might use that as an excuse, but that's no excuse really. In fact, that doesn't even matter. The girls look like they're sick, or constipated, especially that She's Coming Hyeri fancam... that wink looked so wrong and bad. It seems forced, which is worse than just looking sick. I'm glad that they're under another label, but still. Same group. Same concept. I bet that people will get mad if they do something cute, or something far from their concept. That leads me to the double standards.

3. Double Standards
They're not the only KPop group that does this. SISTAR did some sexy concepts like Touch My Body. Brown Eyed Girls with Abracadabra, and Lee Hyori with Bad Girls. Those were some that just came from the top of my head. But they don't do it everytime. A concept gets old, including sexy concepts. However, everyone is gonna use this as clout. That spy camera accident. Yes, that was ironic that it happened to LAYSHA and no one else. LAYSHA, a sexy group, got spy cammed. Not that people should have been mad because they had a right to be mad, but it just feels weird.

In conclusion, everything I've discussed here is facts and opinions. My personal reasons for not liking the group,blah, blah, blah.

Final Thoughts:
1. Why People Like Them: They're a sexy group.
2. The Problem: It's forced.
3. Double Standards: Other groups do this too.",0,1

It is actually with the companies playing pivotal roles behind the scenes that brought me this interest. Usually stuff that can be considered as diplomacy or intrigue with a lot of scheming involved. It was with the disappointing last season of Game of Thrones and recent buzz around industry companies (and with certain scandals) that really got me tracing the identifiable connections. I do have to say however that the K-pop industry is not a direct copy of GoT. Its obvious that the whole business is extremely complicated and meticulous with strings flying everywhere , but the nerdy side of me cant help point it out.

Obviously, every fantasy begins with legendary kings or epic heroes. Seo Taiji and Boys, fits this role perfectly well. If you read into the history of GoT, you would know that Aegon the Conqueror drastically changed everything  in Westeros and it set a precedent to the events of the show. Similarly, Seo Taiji and Boys were the catalyst to K-pop as a whole which then revolutionized South Koreas cultural outreach. They were and still praised as legendary figures to the Korean general public and they are usually regarded with positivity (well with the exception of 1/3 of the group).

On July 5th, 2009, this subreddit was created by u/Intel81994 as a place to discuss Korean pop music.

We've done some digging, and found the [first ever post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8yepa/snsds_genie_plagiarized/) on this sub, it was by none other than u/Intel81994 himself.

How has the subreddit progressed from then to now? Lets go over the milestones of the subreddit!

- - -

####History

When this subreddit was created back in 2009 it was created for the sole purpose of discussing Korean pop music, however, there wasnt that many users that new of this community at the time, so discussions were limited. In 2009 alone there wasn't that many posts made at all, so it wasnt until 2010-2011 where the subreddit started to gain frequent users and subscribers who would bring this subreddit to life. 

-

Before you knew it, the subreddit reached 1000 subscribers on July 1st, 2011. Which is also almost two years after the subreddit was created. (Which is also almost 8 years ago!) What do you think r/kpops favorite songs were in 2011? Check this post [celebrating 1000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ie4a0/1000_rkpop_subs_what_are_your_favorite_kpop/)! 

After 1000 subscribers the sub grew slowly, gaining more users day by day. After 8 months, the subreddit hit its new milestone on March 23rd, 2012. [5000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/r9szg/general_happy_5000_subscribers_rkpop_post_your/)! And on September 17th, 2012. The subreddit hit [10 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1007r2/happy_10k_kpoppers/). This push probably came from Gangnam Style, which made more people aware of K-pop.

-

The subreddit grew day by day, month by month and year by year. On May 30th, 2016 r/kpop hit [50 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4lpqxz/happy_50k_subs/). 

The sub remained started growing at a steady pace, and on October 6th, 2016 we were at [60 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/563ook/meta_60000_subscribers/). We stayed at 60 000 subscribers for quite a while until Reddit started changing the way subscription works for mobile users. Suddenly, we started seeing a massive growth of users day by day. 
We got thousand and thousands of subscribers each day, and on May 11th, 2017, the subreddit hit [80 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6ajibg/80000_subscribers/). And **five** days later we reached 100 000 subscribers!

Reaching [100 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6bto5q/100000_subscribers_party/) was a big milestone for the subreddit. How did that all happen? u/SirBuckeye explains how this all happened [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6bto5q/100000_subscribers_party/), I recommend checking it out!


It took the subreddit **almost a whole year** to get from 50 000 subscribers to 100 000 subscribers! 

**Five months** after reaching 100K, we reached [250 000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/77jlv9/250000_subscribers/). 

-

We are currently closing in on 400 000 subscribers, which we are aiming to hit within the next two months. Our aim for the subreddit at the end of the year is to hit 450 000 subscribers.

#### r/kpop in 2019 so far

What a year its been for us here at r/kpop in 2019 so far.

-

Weve been hit with the biggest scandal ever to happen in K-pop history, which we call Burning Molka. Weve done over [30(!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b9dsv1/the_whos_who_of_burning_molka_a_comprehensive/emmgr2n/?st=jvpbosn1&amp;sh=0472a68d) megathreads to keep our users up to date with all the news that are unfolding daily. We want to give a big shout out to u/Dravvie, u/AlleyBetwixt and u/Hubwub for the amount of time and dedication they have put into these threads over the past few months. Users on different social medias has been redirected to our subreddit as the go-to place for updates on Burning Molka, which is mostly thanks to these three. We also want to give a shout out to the amazing community members who have helped us stay factual, translated articles and reported comments, you've helped us so much during this time! 


With this scandal weve seen a major increase in traffic stats for our subreddit. For the first time ever on the subreddit weve had over 1 million unique visits in a month twice! And ever since October 2018, we are having 10 million page views each month, which is gradually increasing for each month. In March alone, the subreddit had 19 million page views.

-

We've hosted 13 AMAs this year alone so far, which brings our total AMA count up to 41 on this subreddit! u/tuckyd has done a tremendous job in reaching out to artists, producers and songwriters connected to k-pop! With his work, more artists are interested in coming to r/kpop and have AMAs with us here. We have a major increase during the times we host AMA's on the subreddit. This is something we also want to work towards in the future.

If you ever need to check out who's done an AMA on our subreddit, head on over to the [AMA Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/ama) on the wiki page!

-


Looking forward, theres only one a few ways to describe the AMAs coming up, **lovely**, **luxurious**, **golden** and **electrifying**.

## Town Hall / Moderator Applications / Other Subreddit Things

It was mentioned by /u/Kujaichi in the [June Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bvzon0/town_hall_june_2019/epvsrzh/) how we should rename Town Halls due to the name not being descriptive enough. Taking their suggestions into account, Town Hall posts will now have an added description of ""The State of the Subreddit"" as part of its title. However, it will still be called Town Hall.

In the last Town Hall, we mentioned that we were looking for new moderators. The application form closed on June 30th and we received a total of 32 applicants. We have sorted through all of those applications and have contacted those that have made it to the interview phase. To know if you've made it through to the next phase of the application process, please check your Reddit messages for a message from us. It would have been sent by me, /u/hubwub. After we've interviewed those that we have contacted, we will likely announce the new moderators as soon as possible.

We are in the process of re-designing and working on the branding of the subreddit. The redesign will mainly focus on the styling of old Reddit.

Town Hall was pushed to July 5 to coincide with the cake day of the subreddit.

---

## Addressing Video Piracy

Last month, we addressed the audio aspect of piracy on the subreddit. This month we will tackle the video piracy that occurs on the subreddit.

When applicable when submitting video content on the subreddit, use **OFFICIAL SOURCES**. Either on the official YouTube or VLIVE channel of an artist / entertainment company / broadcasting company / etc.

Most of the video piracy that occurs on the subreddit pertains to the `[Variety]` flair. The main culprit is the usage of kshow123.net as a link submission source. However, some of the content that is being submitted are shows that can be found on legal streaming platforms such as Netflix, Viki, KOCOWA, and OnDemandKorea.

The question right now is how to handle these shows:

* Should variety shows that appear on the subreddit be a self post and have structured format similar to /r/koreanvariety?
* Whether it's a self post or not, does the content pertaining to these shows generating engagement? Is it being upvoted? Are people talking about the appearance or episode?
* Should the legal streaming option be the link submission and alternative links can be posted as a comment in the submission?

The reason why we are having this discussion is that we want to avoid a situation in which we could be banned for having illegal content on the subreddit. It is a looming fear that we have as Reddit continually changes.

---

## Title Formatting Rules Revisited

During the June Town Hall, we introduced the `[VLOG]` flair. However, we forgot to provide Title Formatting Rules for those type of submissions.

`Artist - VLOG Title (Date) [RAW/ENG SUB]`

EXAMPLES:

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8izi0/clc_sorn_my_trip_to_thailand_part_1_produsorn/): `CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) @ PRODUSORN (190703) [ENG SUB]`

CORRECT: `[CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) (190703) [ENG SUB]]`

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8mpy7/baekhyuns_vlog_selfteasermv_filming_studiosolo/): `Baekhyun's VLOG (Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album)`

CORRECT: `EXO Baekhyun - Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album (190703) [RAW]`

A reminder we have a title formatting guide when it comes to submissions for the subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_section_v_-_title_formatting_guide). Do not auto-fill the submission title. If you are submitting news, always use the title of the article you are submitting. Dates are always in YYMMDD in parenthesis. The date should never be at the beginning of the submission title.


---

## Shitposting Sunday Thread (Trial) Feedback

June has ended. During that time period, we had a trial for a new weekly feature which was Shitposting Sunday. We had a total of five threads during the trial period.

* [20190602](https://redd.it/bvzqoz)
* [20190609](https://redd.it/byh0z6)
* [20190616](https://redd.it/c18xu1)
* [20190623](https://redd.it/c480bn)
* [20190630](https://redd.it/c7c0hl)

Do you think it was a success? Or did we fail with the concept? Overall thoughts on it?

## 2019 /r/kpop Census Preparation

The annual /r/kpop Census is held on August 1. It will coincide with the August Town Hall.

You can find previous censuses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/census).

We are looking for any feedback on how questions could be asked differently. We will do a question review of the 2018 Census a week from today, July 12.

## /r/kpop's participation at KCON NY 2019

If you are at KCON NY this upcoming weekend, /r/kpop will be there.

We are participating in two panels:

We are in the process of re-designing and working on the branding of the subreddit. The redesign will mainly focus on the styling of old Reddit.

Town Hall was pushed to July 5 to coincide with the cake day of the subreddit.

## Addressing Video Piracy

Last month, we addressed the audio aspect of piracy on the subreddit. This month we will tackle the video piracy that occurs on the subreddit.

When applicable when submitting video content on the subreddit, use **OFFICIAL SOURCES**. Either on the official YouTube or VLIVE channel of an artist / entertainment company / broadcasting company / etc.

Most of the video piracy that occurs on the subreddit pertains to the `[Variety]` flair. The main culprit is the usage of kshow123.net as a link submission source. However, some of the content that is being submitted are shows that can be found on legal streaming platforms such as Netflix, Viki, KOCOWA, and OnDemandKorea.

The question right now is how to handle these shows:

* Should variety shows that appear on the subreddit be a self post and have structured format similar to /r/koreanvariety?
* Whether it's a self post or not, does the content pertaining to these shows generating engagement? Is it being upvoted? Are people talking about the appearance or episode?
* Should the legal streaming option be the link submission and alternative links can be posted as a comment in the submission?

The reason why we are having this discussion is that we want to avoid a situation in which we could be banned for having illegal content on the subreddit. It is a looming fear that we have as Reddit continually changes.

## Title Formatting Rules Revisited

During the June Town Hall, we introduced the `[VLOG]` flair. However, we forgot to provide Title Formatting Rules for those type of submissions.

`Artist - VLOG Title (Date) [RAW/ENG SUB]`

EXAMPLES:

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8izi0/clc_sorn_my_trip_to_thailand_part_1_produsorn/): `CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) @ PRODUSORN (190703) [ENG SUB]`

CORRECT: `[CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) (190703) [ENG SUB]]`

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8mpy7/baekhyuns_vlog_selfteasermv_filming_studiosolo/): `Baekhyun's VLOG (Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album)`

CORRECT: `EXO Baekhyun - Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album (190703) [RAW]`

A reminder we have a title formatting guide when it comes to submissions for the subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_section_v_-_title_formatting_guide). Do not auto-fill the submission title. If you are submitting news, always use the title of the article you are submitting. Dates are always in YYMMDD in parenthesis. The date should never be at the beginning of the submission title.

## Shitposting Sunday Thread (Trial) Feedback

June has ended. During that time period, we had a trial for a new weekly feature which was Shitposting Sunday. We had a total of five threads during the trial period.

* [20190602](https://redd.it/bvzqoz)
* [20190609](https://redd.it/byh0z6)
* [20190616](https://redd.it/c18xu1)
* [20190623](https://redd.it/c480bn)
* [20190630](https://redd.it/c7c0hl)

Do you think it was a success? Or did we fail with the concept? Overall thoughts on it?

## 2019 /r/kpop Census Preparation

The annual /r/kpop Census is held on August 1. It will coincide with the August Town Hall.

You can find previous censuses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/census).

We are looking for any feedback on how questions could be asked differently. We will do a question review of the 2018 Census a week from today, July 12.

So casual viewers, get ready for the stellar Concept Evaluation performances!

For this round, the benefit vote rule works as follows:

&gt;Thetrainees who get first place on each team will get a benefit that multiplies the votesfrom the studio audienceby 500.

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.**  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release from the month listed in the title* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

850,2019-7-7,2019,7,7,4,c9xam1,Volunteer Account : A.C.E in Toronto (07/06) and DEAN x you.will.knovv (07/07),anonkpopvolunteer,1562439880,"Hey Reddit! I recently volunteered for two kpop concerts in Toronto for DEAN and A.C.E. Both shows were organized by Pop Goes the World. As some of you guys may know, those two concerts didn't end up going smoothly, with a lot of issues occurring regarding lineup issues, fans not receiving perks, and delays, etc. To be honest, this is less of a ""fan account"" and more of an explanation to any DEAN and A.C.E fans that were left in the dark on why certain issues occurred during the show. I debated on posting this, but the way you guys were treated during the concerts was not acceptable, and seeing Gerald (the CEO of PGTW) sass and block fans who bring legitimate concerns/criticism on twitter really rubbed me the wrong way. So without further ado, here's everything you guys should know. If you guys want to know more about what fans had to endure during the two concerts, please refer to the following [thread](https://twitter.com/parkjhyng/status/1146296212217352192)

**A.C.E** 

1. Soundcheck - Originally, fans who payed for diamond tier tickets (the most expensive tickets) were informed they would be given an exclusive soundcheck with the boys. The original plan were to have diamonds come in before the show, find their seats, and then watch A.C.E do a soundcheck. This soundcheck was going to be for the fans, as they were doing their official soundcheck prior. However, Pop Goes The World ended up not fully informing the venue/ A.C.E's staff of this plan, and they didn't approve of it. So it was decided that fans would come in groups and watch the boys perform a soundcheck for ten minutes at a time before being escorted back outside. However, one of the translators backstage was caught invading the boy's privacy (she took videos of them and posted them on her Instagram in front of A.C.E's staff). Because of that, the staff decided to not use her and they had to cancel soundcheck. Gerald ended up lying to fans and told them that A.C.E took too long in rehearsal. 
2. Issues in Seating Arrangements - Based on the official seating arrangement, I was expecting the concert to be held in an auditorium or theater format. It ended up being in a pit. While I don't know why they did this, I'm assuming it's because it's cheaper to rent, and DEAN was set to also perform in a pit so it was more convenient to rent the same room. So, PGTW decided to fill up a pit with fold-able chairs. Unfortunately, the size of the pit was WAY smaller than what they anticipated. Rows were supposed to fit around 36 seats in total, but volunteers could only manage to fit in around 24 chairs because the pit was too narrow, and there were equipment/vendors blocking the way. PGTW ended up telling us that it was fine, and we'd deal with it when the fans came. Once we started letting fans in, many fans were left without seats. So, PGTW ended up changing the seating to general admission, and letting in each tier at a time and pick their own seat. Problem was a lot of fans came right before the show because they bought reserved seats, and many people had to sit in the back row even if they bought better seats. 
3. Posters - Every fan was promised a signed poster in an email that was sent by PGTW. What volunteers were told day of the concert was that they sold more tickets than they anticipated for the A.C.E concert in Montreal, and because of that, they didn't have enough posters for the fans. So, they told us to only give signed posters to people who bought the most expensive tickets, unsigned posters would be given to people who bought platinum and gold tickets, and we were to kick out and not give any posters to people who bought silver tickets. If anyone was to complain, we'd tell them to email Gerald. Funny thing is, we ended up having a bunch of unsigned posters at the end of the concert. I don't know if they miscounted or if they wanted to save some for A.C.E's upcoming show in Calgary, but there was enough to give to at least SOME of the people who bought silver tickets. 

**DEAN** 

1. Lines/Delays - This one is all on PGTW. I know a lot of people were throwing heat on the venue security, but trust me when I say they didn't know anything. In terms of lining up fans, PGTW's original plan was to give out numbered wristbands so that they could come back and save their spot in line. Sounds feasible, until they told security that plan the day of the concert. Security basically shot down that plan because it didn't make sense. How were hundreds of fans going to get in order of their wristbands once they all returned to the venue at different times. So then, PGTW told volunteers to just give out wristbands and have fans wait. They could leave, but they would lose their spot in line. So many fans were stuck waiting in line for hours in the hot weather. The security at Phoenix ended up offering to take the blame from PGTW. As for why the concert got delayed for so long, soundcheck ended up taking nearly five hours because some of the staff were picky on how things were going to go, and there were issues with the LCD screen. 

In conclusion, Pop Goes the World has no organization at all. Their CEO, Gerald, is a DJ who has little to no business knowledge and doesn't know a thing about event management and doing things ahead of time. I ended up talking to a lot of people who are involved in the k-pop concert industry those two days, and I heard so many bad things about him. When I tell you guys he has a bad reputation in this industry, don't underestimate me. The entire concert was extremely disorganized, and volunteers and staff had no idea what to do because so many things were put onto us last minute. Volunteers didn't even hear back from PGTW until mid to late June. I handed in my volunteer application in April. Pretty much the entire organization is run by Gerald. A lot of people who I assumed were PGTW staff due to the work they did told me they don't even get paid. None of the volunteers were briefed beforehand on what we had to do, and the venue security/staff was just as if not more clueless than we were. Gerald never even talked to us during the two shows, and he ended up dipping as soon as the DEAN concert ended because he knew fans were going to hunt him down. 

On the bright side, getting to be behind the scenes for a k-pop concert was extremely fun. We got to see the majority of the concert, and getting to see how things are run behind the scenes is really fascinating. A.C.E and DEAN were really nice to work for, and I really liked a lot of the volunteers (fun fact, A.C.E look like dolls in real life, I actually got shocked at their visuals). If you get the opportunity, definitely do it! You'll have the chance to meet stylists, staff, the actual artists, and there's some perks as well (free food, show, soundchecks), along with the fact that it's nice to contribute back to something that you really love. If any DEAN or A.C.E fans are reading this, I want to personally apologize for the way you guys were treated/are currently being treated. None of you guys deserved that treatment, and I, along with the rest of the staff and volunteers am sincerely sorry for how things panned out.",0,7

A couple of guys were interested in us, spoke to us, but one caught my eye and it was him. We made eye contact a few times and I was instantly attracted to him. 

I didnt think of it much because guys at the club jump from one girl to another so, I brushed it off my shoulder.

Then later, me and my friends went for another round of drinks at our booth (VIP section) and to my surprise he came over.

At first I didnt know who he was. However, he looked familiar. He started speaking, my friends got the hint and left us two to talk. We instantly clicked, he was actually really sweet. That night we did kiss but he didnt make anymore moves, but we exchanged numbers.

A couple of days go by and he invited me out to have dinner at a hotel. He made sure it was private enough so no one could tell who he was. 

We ate dinner and we got a bit drunk (thats what careless adults do) and we started walking to the hotel lobby. He stopped and looked at me, I looked at him to. (God he was so handsome) and we started making out, it got heated and he took me to his hotel room and we did it.

I actually didnt tell my friends about this night, I didnt tell anyone. I really wanted to tell someone about this but he told me not to and I dont want to cause trouble. 

But I feel like writing it here, not mentioning his name, its fine for me to do it right? Its not like anyone will believe me. 

He was good at it, he was amazing. We talk here and there but hes busy. 

I came back three weeks ago from Korea and I feel different.",1,0

That song somehow reminded me to ""Summer Sun"" by Texas, it's an old song with video that I'm not going to link right away as it may be rated 18+ or anything. But the feel of the song is pretty much the same (or so it reminded me...). I'll totally love to see Solar covering this one, seeing how Mamamoo are such good singers. 

And of course there are hundreds of others I'd like to see covered by anyone, be it Blackpink, GD etc. Or Queen classics, dozens of old italian songs, MJ, Elvis Presley basically anything (I know copyrights are an issue though....which sucks).",50,24

At that time I hated kpop, I even said to myself self I will never ever gonna try to listen to it, but she convinced me to try, and oh boy how grateful I am she did. As I got interested in kpop more and more, I explored more and more. I watched the sad stuff(I cried a lot) and the happy stuff. Kpop really helped me a lot, it helped in the hard times and it opened my eyes in a way. I still can't believe I was so lucky to have come across that girl.

There is a world that is waiting for you
So are you ready or not?
Dont miss this moment
Time is ticking
Tick tock, tick tock

&gt; Its natural to get lost like a child
On unfamiliar paths (unfamiliar paths)

You can slowly take a break (ah...)

926,2019-7-7,2019,7,7,22,ca6z0t,"Why is JYPE viewed as the best entertainment company despite them doing so many shady, abusive and just terrible things?",lalaliana8,1562507075,"They have abused their trainees in the past, overwork their artists, poorly promote/manage some of their artists and yet, somehow, they're seen as ""the nicest entertainment company"" or ""the best out of the big 3"". I don't understand why this is the case. 

I think u/alexkeev said it best: 

&gt; JYPE could literally work one of its artists to death and they'd still get praised for being 'the nice company' somehow. Fans of a group from any other company would be outraged at the kind of overwork JYPE's groups go through, but ONCE, Ahgases, Stays, etc, don't do anything about it because JYPE has somehow brainwashed everyone into thinking they're a nice, humane company, when they're really, really not. 

&gt; Also don't reply to me with misquoted facts, mistranslations, and straight up misinformation. No, employees do not eat at the JYP cafe for free, only the trainees do. JYPE's actual actions show that half the shit in that JYP 2.0 presentation was just pretty words to try and look good. The rest of the shit people bring up to try and paint JYP as a good company are shitty mistranslations or straight up lies from twitter stans. Do some actual research yourself before you spread the lies JYp gets praised for. 

&gt; Especially don't talk to me about the fact they had a 2 week vacation a while back. The vacations isn't the issue, it's the ridiculous overwork they go through when they're actually on schedule. Vacations don't do anything to help if you're not only working 100 hours a week, but doing so at such erratic times that it's hard to get good sleep.

&gt; Like, after the fucking concert in Manila that finished at 10 or so, they were at the airport getting a plane back to korea at 11/12-ish. A flight from PH to SK takes around 3 hours, so with going through the airport and driving back to Seoul we can assume they were back in their dorm to sleep probably at about 5 or 6? And then how much we wanna bet they had another schedule the next day too, since there had to have been a reason they went back to Korea so quickly? It's so fucking unfair and it's so indicative of how they and other artists are treated by the company. I can guarantee that even the schedules we don't see are constantly like that, plus all the practice they have to do. No regard for Twice's health or wellbeing. Who cares if they just made a million dollars for their company at a concert, they need to go make more money!

&gt; Now just look at their upcoming schedules. Their american concerts are largely across the country from each other, so gotta fly between each one, and only two days apart. So probably close to zero rest between each show. 

&gt; All this and people say shit like ""thank you JYP for letting them rest"". Like wtf??? Praising a company for letting a sick employee take a day off??? Literally brainwashed, man. Apparently all you have to do is *act* like you're a nice company and people will believe it and you can get away with anything. Fuck JYP, fuck JYPE, and fuck JYPE apologists.

Alongside this, you also have JYP himself doing a bunch of shitty stuff. Remember when he tried to expand Wonder Girls in the US? Remember how he broke the law and wasn't treating the girls properly during that period? I'm sure there are plenty other examples of JYP being a nutcracker, but that's the only one I could think of off the top of my head. 

Sorry if this post is a little messy and I sound really pissed, it's because I am. Im really worried for the TWICE girls because they aren't being treated right, and I'm also extending my concern to the rest of JYPs artists, actors and other people who signed contracts with this agency. I'm really worried for newer groups like Stray Kids and ITZY, and what could potentially happen if they began to dominate kpop just like TWICE does now. Would they be treated the same, better or worse?",16,0

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc.  If this catches on I can make it a weekly thing and give updates on groups doing new stuff as well as rotate in different Nugu groups.  Let me know what kind of content you'd like to see.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Why?**

I thought this would be a fun thing to do, and might help bring attention to some groups that can easily get drowned out by the marketing push from the big agencies.  

&amp;#x200B;

**What is 'Nugu'?**

I'm defining it as groups from outside of the Big 3+1 (JYP/YGE/SM+Big Hit) that are relatively new to the scene and/or haven't won any music shows/don't have the budget to promote on those shows.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many new groups debuting that it's not practical to mention everyone in one post or update on everyone every week, so I'm going to pick some that jump out at me this week and will rotate others in and out if this becomes a thing.  I am going to focus on groups that are currently active.  Let me know if there's anyone you'd like to see! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll also add that I personally follow girl groups almost exclusively, I'll add information on boy groups, but I'm not as confident in that field so I'll rely on the boy group fans to fill me in on what I'm missing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Format**

Since this is my first try at this I'm going to go infodump and add commentary as far as I know and can glean from public sources, please feel free to share your thoughts about changes that might make it better, any information that may be incorrect, and add your own bits of knowledge.

You'd never see SNSD or 2NE1 or the likes with an open top as far as I know

Pretty sure I pretty rapstar had some influence but in terms of idol groups I'm not sure who started but so far I've noticed a trend change. As videos go: 

-there are a few shots in Kard's Boom Boom video (there's also the ace topless but guys are accepted I guess lol) 

- Jennies solo video. It kinda goes under the radar since she broke the record for different outfits per second

- Gidle Uh- Oh - this is kinda subtle too but Soyeon is wearing a very lose top jiggling it. On the performance with the same outfit, her black top is much more tight so this does not happen

- Exids new video. LE is literally throwing it on your face while she drops her lines 

- Chungha snapping. One of her black tops is also subtly pushing the boundary

I'm sure there are at least a few more. These are the songs I've been listening to lately that made me ponder upon this

Is this a cultural shift? Again I'm not complaining, I actually think it's great that we're eliminating double standards and empowering wamen!",28,0
958,2019-7-8,2019,7,8,4,caaise,Fan Account: Volunteering for A.C.E in Toronto (07/06) and DEAN x you.will.knovv (07/07),anonkpopvolunteer,1562526217,"Hey Reddit! I recently volunteered for two kpop concerts in Toronto for DEAN and A.C.E. Both shows were organized by Pop Goes the World. As some of you guys may know, those two concerts didn't end up going smoothly, with a lot of issues occurring regarding lineup issues, fans not receiving perks, and delays, etc. To be honest, this is less of a ""fan account"" and more of an explanation to any DEAN and A.C.E fans that were left in the dark on why certain issues occurred during the show. I debated on posting this, but the way you guys were treated during the concerts was not acceptable, and seeing Gerald (the CEO of PGTW) sass and block fans who bring legitimate concerns/criticism on twitter really rubbed me the wrong way. So without further ado, here's everything you guys should know. If you guys want to know more about what fans had to endure during the two concerts, please refer to the following [thread](https://twitter.com/parkjhyng/status/1146296212217352192)

**A.C.E** 

1. Soundcheck - Originally, fans who payed for diamond tier tickets (the most expensive tickets) were informed they would be given an exclusive soundcheck with the boys. The original plan were to have diamonds come in before the show, find their seats, and then watch A.C.E do a soundcheck. This soundcheck was going to be for the fans, as they were doing their official soundcheck prior. However, Pop Goes The World ended up not fully informing the venue/ A.C.E's staff of this plan, and they didn't approve of it. So it was decided that fans would come in groups and watch the boys perform a soundcheck for ten minutes at a time before being escorted back outside. However, one of the translators backstage was caught invading the boy's privacy (she took videos of them and posted them on her Instagram in front of A.C.E's staff). Because of that, the staff decided to not use her and they had to cancel soundcheck. Gerald ended up lying to fans and told them that A.C.E took too long in rehearsal. 
2. Issues in Seating Arrangements - Based on the official seating arrangement, I was expecting the concert to be held in an auditorium or theater format. It ended up being in a pit. While I don't know why they did this, I'm assuming it's because it's cheaper to rent, and DEAN was set to also perform in a pit so it was more convenient to rent the same room. So, PGTW decided to fill up a pit with fold-able chairs. Unfortunately, the size of the pit was WAY smaller than what they anticipated. Rows were supposed to fit around 36 seats in total, but volunteers could only manage to fit in around 24 chairs because the pit was too narrow, and there were equipment/vendors blocking the way. PGTW ended up telling us that it was fine, and we'd deal with it when the fans came. Once we started letting fans in, many fans were left without seats. So, PGTW ended up changing the seating to general admission, and letting in each tier at a time and pick their own seat. Problem was a lot of fans came right before the show because they bought reserved seats, and many people had to sit in the back row even if they bought better seats. 
3. Posters - Every fan was promised a signed poster in an email that was sent by PGTW. What volunteers were told day of the concert was that they sold more tickets than they anticipated for the A.C.E concert in Montreal, and because of that, they didn't have enough posters for the fans. So, they told us to only give signed posters to people who bought the most expensive tickets, unsigned posters would be given to people who bought platinum and gold tickets, and we were to kick out and not give any posters to people who bought silver tickets. If anyone was to complain, we'd tell them to email Gerald. Funny thing is, we ended up having a bunch of unsigned posters at the end of the concert. I don't know if they miscounted or if they wanted to save some for A.C.E's upcoming show in Calgary, but there was enough to give to at least SOME of the people who bought silver tickets. 

**DEAN** 

1. Lines/Delays - This one is all on PGTW. I know a lot of people were throwing heat on the venue security, but trust me when I say they didn't know anything. In terms of lining up fans, PGTW's original plan was to give out numbered wristbands so that they could come back and save their spot in line. Sounds feasible, until they told security that plan the day of the concert. Security basically shot down that plan because it didn't make sense. How were hundreds of fans going to get in order of their wristbands once they all returned to the venue at different times. So then, PGTW told volunteers to just give out wristbands and have fans wait. They could leave, but they would lose their spot in line. So many fans were stuck waiting in line for hours in the hot weather. The security at Phoenix ended up offering to take the blame from PGTW. As for why the concert got delayed for so long, soundcheck ended up taking nearly five hours because some of the staff were picky on how things were going to go, and there were issues with the LCD screen. 

In conclusion, Pop Goes the World has no organization at all. Their CEO, Gerald, is a DJ who has little to no business knowledge and doesn't know a thing about event management and doing things ahead of time. I ended up talking to a lot of people who are involved in the k-pop concert industry those two days, and I heard so many bad things about him. When I tell you guys he has a bad reputation in this industry, don't underestimate me. The entire concert was extremely disorganized, and volunteers and staff had no idea what to do because so many things were put onto us last minute. Volunteers didn't even hear back from PGTW until mid to late June. I handed in my volunteer application in April. Pretty much the entire organization is run by Gerald. A lot of people who I assumed were PGTW staff due to the work they did told me they don't even get paid. None of the volunteers were briefed beforehand on what we had to do, and the venue security/staff was just as if not more clueless than we were. Gerald never even talked to us during the two shows, and he ended up dipping as soon as the DEAN concert ended because he knew fans were going to hunt him down. 

On the bright side, getting to be behind the scenes for a k-pop concert was extremely fun. We got to see the majority of the concert, and getting to see how things are run behind the scenes is really fascinating. A.C.E and DEAN were really nice to work for, and I really liked a lot of the volunteers (fun fact, A.C.E look like dolls in real life, I actually got shocked at their visuals). If you get the opportunity, definitely do it! You'll have the chance to meet stylists, staff, the actual artists, and there's some perks as well (free food, show, soundchecks), along with the fact that it's nice to contribute back to something that you really love. If any DEAN or A.C.E fans are reading this, I want to personally apologize for the way you guys were treated/are currently being treated. None of you guys deserved that treatment, and I, along with the rest of the staff and volunteers am sincerely sorry for how things panned out.",15,119

2014: seems doing great and still going strong even with them hitting their 5th year this year. but with that, comes the conversations about contract extensions and boy group members having a few more years left before they enlist.

2015: i'm sensing most groups get to comeback regularly  and has a mix of domestic and international success, but there's a bit disparity in terms of overall popularity among these groups from this year.

2016: have so much potential but some of these groups encountered problems with members or with their companies and the same problem of popularity imbalance.

I always enjoy watching variety shows (especially when its an guest episode of a favorite group) and it shows so much of each members unique and funny personalities and it obviously is a part of what propels them into stardom, by letting people get to know them. Which is why I wonder why some other groups dont appear in varieties that much? (And Im talking about appearances as a full group)

Everglow has already been past their promotional period for a long time but I have not yet seen them in famous variety shows yet (Idol Room, Weekly Idol, Knowing Brothers, Running Man, etc.) 

Fromis_9 are a bunch of variety queens (theyre seriously so funny from what Ive seen of them) but they dont go out the usual Idol Room and Weekly Idol bubble, I feel like theyd be so great at other types of shows too. (As well as G-Idle)

Itzy has filmed an episode in Knowing Brothers and Master in the House (where its more of JYP actually) but still no Idol Room or Weekly Idol.

#Pronunciation Guide

As we know from the survey, not a ton of us are Korean experts (omo~ ). The wonderful native speaker /u/jellyfilled_donut took the time to put together a pronunciation guide for us. Please give her tons of love, we would all sound a lot stupider without her guidance.

Here are jelly's guides to the vowel sounds, and below is her guide to I NEED U itself (with some slight adjustments to rhythm by me), romanized with emphasized syllables bolded.

A few quick notes:

* Despite being a BTS song, this rap is actually not hard at all! The only line that I expect people to have some difficulties on is RM's that starts with ""bunmyeong"". My only advice is to take it slow and try to count it out in your head or clap along with it to get the rhythm while you practice.

* I will leave it entirely up to personal discretion whether or not you'd like to pronounce ""girl"" correctly.

The prices are: for London.  

VIP: 110 (includes vip standing, hi touch and early entry) General: 45 Balcony: 55

But I get anxious quite a bit, and the idea of meeting my faves kind of freaks me out because I always worry if I'll end up coming across too strong. And I hear about terrible hi touch sessions all the time (and they're always when groups do it through my music taste) 

But I wanted to get other people's opinions and experiences on hi-touchs since I don't know many kpop fans irl. I would really appreciate it!!",11,2

Taeyong in the whiplash intro, the haka intro of simon says

that ""we are so different cha cha cha"" in 24k-Superfly

sorry idk who does it but those aya aya ayas in Seventeen- Good to Me

Jhope in the background of the last chorus of Jamais Vu

Jin's adlib at the end of Don't Leave Me

that water droplet sound effect in EXO Love Shot lol

Jooheon's yayas in Monsta X- Fallin'

those two pops that come after jhope's line in Save Me

the keolka keolkas, deol deols, and the jeom jeoms from Stray Kids-Side Effects give me life

hopefully my examples made some type of sense lol anybody have stuff like this?",197,165

For me, I strongly believe that kpop has been Americanized. And you know what? That's fine! As much I love Korea's ""signature sound""* I think that it's a great thing that two *very* different cultures can mix together and create a beautiful new kind of sound.

1176,2019-7-9,2019,7,9,12,caviae,Revise a Flop era and turn it into a Hit era (idea from r/popheads),charlieedog,1562643849,"Idea taken from u/reddituser246, here's the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/c3pkxo/revise_a_flop_era_and_turn_it_into_a_hit_era/) to get the idea (as you can see, 'flop' can be relative but try to choose an era that underperformed in some way, be it physical/digital sales, disliked by fanbase etc.)

I'll start:

&amp;#x200B;

**NCT 127's Limitless:** Great choice of title track BUT the 90s hiphop styling on steroids was way too alienating/weird (+ Winwin dreads... it's a no for me) and I think scared off a lot of potential fans. I think if they had used Simon Says styling for this concept it would have been huge, maybe with darker colors and keeping the red/blue color scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

**Red Velvet's Zimzalabim:** The song is unique enough that it should be the title track, BUT the MV needed to be more plot driven. People compared it disfavorably to IGAB, saying that 'IGAB makes sense once you read the lyrics' aka once people understand the story they can accept a nontraditional song structure. I think people would have been way more onboard with Zimzalabim if it had an MV plot like ""Red Velvet goes to the carnival and their Us-style doubles work the rides and through them they learn to let go/maybe get zimzalakidnapped into the circus"".

&amp;#x200B;

**CLC's Where Are You** is a beautiful 80's song but should have stayed a fan-favorite B-side. Free'sm 's title track should switch to I Like It which is a nice marriage of the hardness of Hobgoblin and sassy playful No Oh Oh while also introducing some of the heavy synths we'd hear in Black Dress. And for the love of god I'd CHANGE THE NAME (Seriously, CLC has ""Like it"", ""I Like it"", ""Like That"", ""Like"" .... wtf).",64,106

To my delightful surprise, Ive discovered a very strong following for K-pop and  K-dramas among the many young people there. My perception initially was that Malaysia would be more conservative due to its following of Sharia Law, but upon arriving I had an immediate take back of my assumption.

Now this left me wondering how K-pop is perceived or treated in other Muslim majority  countries. I know that the religion is widespread and diverse so no culture would be the same. 

So Id like to ask what do they think of K-pop? Is the music good? Is the music bad?

Im curious to know!",73,60

They played the same song every morning (I think several times) but I have no idea what it is called. We tried shazam-ing it but it was too quiet to be picked up. It was all in Korean (which I don't speak) and had a bit that went 'woohoo' or 'wooo' and i am sure it was a male singer. I know this isn't much to go off but I am hoping someone somehow knows which song I am on about or has been to the cafe and have also heard it.,3,2

I wondered that for quite some time:  
To train and debut costs a company a lot of money and many trainees have to pay back the money that was invested in them. I remember especially Mamamoo talking about that once having paid back their debts after their first album sold well or something. If you come from a wealthy background and have already received training in singing and dancing, courtesy to your parents, you are in a way, a better investment to a company. Whatever debts you make your parents can pay for you - and you already arrive in a much better ""trained state"", so the company doesn't need to spend time on you.

Furthermore if you don't make it, it's not your financial ruin because of your background. Do you think that some trainees are able to buy their way into companies or is anything known about this?",69,89

1253,2019-7-9,2019,7,9,23,cb1bvg,Any kpop song lyric translation request? (week 47),ThisGuyKpops,1562681232," 

Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",3,8

&amp;#x200B;

**WTS RARE AUTOGRAPHED COLLECTIBLES AND OUT-OF-PRINT ALBUMS AND MERCH (BIG BANG, DBSK, SHINee, 2NE1, WONDER GIRLS, 2PM, JYJ &amp; MORE) **

&amp;#x200B;

Hello friends! Im passing on the pretty things Ive collected over the years (some very, very precious to me!) as Im moving out of the country. My kpop collection has been kept in pristine condition as I take very good care of my stuff - the photos speak for themselves! Below is a list of the items I have for sale; most of them are BNIP (brand spankin new and sealed) and all of them, I believe, are out-of-print by now and very hard to come by. Ive seen people on ebay selling many of these albums for outrageous prices, which Im not gonna do  most of the albums are priced around $8. I also have in my collection some rare photobooks (like the Big Bang History 2008-2006 set) and autographed collectibles that are so precious to me, and that I will be letting go for a higher price. Ive tried my best to be as reasonable as I can be so that hopefully yall can snag some nice gems for yourselves 

&amp;#x200B;

**Feel free to check out the detailed photos of all these gems at the link here:** [**https://carousell.com/babythingss/?collection\_id=25**](https://carousell.com/babythingss/?collection_id=25)

&amp;#x200B;

**To purchase or ask me any questions, please email me at** [**justbabythingss@gmail.com**](mailto:justbabythingss@gmail.com) ****

&amp;#x200B;

Seller Info:

\- I ship from Singapore to anywhere in the world, provided the buyer covers shipping costs.

\- For Singaporeans, meetups for collection are available.

\- Payment by Paypal (International Buyers), Funds Transfer/Cash Upon Meetup (Singapore Buyers).

\- Prices may be negotiable for some items, especially if you purchase more items. Feel free to drop me an email with your offer if you're interested in any items 

Note: All prices are in USD (followed by SGD in brackets)

&amp;#x200B;

**Autographed Collectibles:**

NOTE: Apart from the CNBlue Poster and FT Island Cross and Change Album, the other signed CDs were obtained from my friends uncle who used to work in the KBS broadcasting station (we call him the KBS god). These were all promotional CDs/collectibles given out to staff members/the media, which explains why some have a not-for-sale label printed on the album. It also explains why I only have these few autographed collectibles in my collection as I could only take what I can get and had no other way of obtaining other ones. (So for those who are asking if I can get (insert kpop group's name)'s autographed item, I can't, and even if I can find them on ebay or something I wouldn't know if they're authentic so I personally wouldn't take that risk) Adding this little note for clarity :)

Title tracks generally receive the focus regardless of the group, however, there are definitely Kpop artists that have really strong albums to back them up. I think an example of a singles artist would be Blackpink given that they didn't even have any B-sides until almost two years after their debut. They also have yet to even release a full album, unfortunately. I see a group like SHINee as more of an albums artist. Most of their singles have a mini or full-length album to back it up with great b-sides that suit the concept of the title track. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with being more of a singles artist or an albums artist. I'm just interested to see how people would categorize different Kpop artists.",3,0

For me, I can definitely remember for my favorite groups.

First song:
(G)I-DLE: If it counts, I think I loved Soyeon and Miyeon as soon as I saw them step on stage at LoL World Finals. But for the group and their music, the one-two punch of Soyeon licking the blood off her finger into Minnie's mysterious look/voice in Hann sold me on the group. Not that I'm into vampires, it just was such a far cry from what I thought I knew about kpop

BTS: When the car exploded in the background of the Mic Drop MV. Again, the MV just threw me for a loop on my preconceptions about kpop.

Blackpink: When Lisa threw the powder for the second time. I know that sounds weird, but it was just such an auditory and visual attack that I was blown away.

Dreamcatcher: In the PIRI MV, the last chorus with Siyeon's delicate vocals and then it just DROPS. Also the choreo where they're pressing their arms out immediately seemed like ""Yeah, we're here and we're different. And we're fucking dope.""

Stray Kids: My Pace. There's a reason Changbin is my bias. It was not up to me.

Chungha: Watched her perform Roller Coaster at MAMA 2018, but realized it was clearly a remix, so I went to check out the live stages since I had heard she was a good dancer. That fuckin wink, man. Yeah, I'm looking Chungha.

Second Song:
Twice: Second MV, I thought I didn't like the cutesy style after I watched Likey, but then I realized that it had been stuck in my head for the next day. So I tried TT and that hip-swaying choreo in the chorus got me.",119,57

The ""Cube will surpass JYP"" [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2i5ilx/do_you_think_jyp_can_keep_up_their_reputation_as/) popped into my head today and rereading it is a hoot. The top comment by a wide margin says that Big 3 has been dead for a while and that JYP will never be able to catch up. The cherry on top is the commenter with the top response to this thinks admits they're biased in agreeing that Cube has surpassed JYP but has a Twice flair meaning they became a fan of the group that proved them wrong. 

Now, I don't want this to be mean or anything. Most predictions are quite reasonable based on what is known to them at that moment. Time just has a funny way of proving us wrong sometimes.",294,197

Maybe PDX101 since Wanna One was so close to selling 1m, I dont know it they reached it for one album sale (someone correct me if they did)  

Also when do you think BTS and EXO massive physical sales will dwindle down? Will it be once they enter enlistment, how many more years do you predict they can keep selling that much? I give it Maybe 3 more years or less? Its impressive their sales keep going up every year but I do wonder who will be next, no one has been close to reaching their sales, I believe Wanna One had a chance but unfortunately they disbanded.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

1426,2019-7-11,2019,7,11,4,cbl9za,KPop groups + live band performances,uber-lou,1562787162,"Been listening to KPop for almost a year now and one of the things I enjoy most is seeing groups perform with a live band.  BTS' backing band always puts together spectacular live arrangements.  I saw Blackpink's Coachella set and their band added so much to the performance (I understand this band has played for BIGBANG as well).  

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other groups (especially in this current generation) who play with a live band on occasion? Would love to learn about other fun live performances.  Some groups who I think would sound great with a live band are Mamamoo and TWICE (especially with their recent releases)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my favorites:

[BTS - Spring Day 2017 KBS Music Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztEVzpVEml0)

1429,2019-7-11,2019,7,11,5,cblr8z,Do you think there will be another explosive group soon?,bowprinted,1562789385,"By explosive, I mean breaking out like EXO did with Growl, which is when the 3rd generation really shifted. EXO hitting big really revived the Kpop market (specially for physical sales). Before them, there was a period where kpop felt stagnant. I mean the groups that were on the top (Big Bang, SNSD, etc) were still doing good but it felt as if none of the new groups coming out were on the same level as the previous generation. But with Growl, there was a renewed interest in the kpop and I do think it snowballed into creating a momentum that created an atmosphere where the big girl group breakouts of 2014 and BTS' rapid rise in popularity were able to happen.

This period now reminds me of the same thing. There are a lot of great artists and groups, and the top groups are still doing great (BTS is breaking boundaries that were thought to be impossible back then), but the newer groups haven't been able to create the same impact yet. Idols ranking on charts have also been overall down and there just seems be a lull in the industry even though there are a good amount of monster rookies.

Do you think the rookies now just need time? Or will it take a whole another new group? Another question is, will it be one of the Big 3 groups? Or do you think that kpop has just phased out of the period where groups becoming monsters with just a hit track can happen (since a lot of the recent rise is more dependent on social media and growing steadily)?

I'm actually writing a paper on the growth and rise of an industry right now (not kpop) and I just saw some similar patterns. I may just be overthinking it though lol but I wanted to know the general consensus.",1,0

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I am anticipating Seulgi's solo the most. I think everyone expects like a dark pop vibe but I find that a little basic. Also, Chungha has got that on lock. I would love to see her hone her ""cool girl aesthetic"". By that, I mean taking the aesthetic of her [converse cf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzAtPRT3540) and adding like a dance-pop song. For example, I think her performing a [Tove Lo-Cool Girl,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsFneCExrCQ) [Rita Ora- How we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOOxlVUC08Q), or [Hayley Kioko-Feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-_Yuc228s) esq song would really suit her while also adding something new to the music conversation. Again, the aesthetic could be like her converse cf or any [Mura Masa MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjle_ZI4elo).  

&amp;#x200B;

I have also found myself really into (G)i-dle's Minnie. I think she will definitely be the next member to have a solo debut. We can expect a very soothing piano pop song. I think [Sara Barellis-King of Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7-AUmiNcA) or [Lenka-The Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elsh3J5lJ6g) is an amazing blueprint for her musical sound. I would also push for an English release. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a Blackpink fan and I'm not really a fan of Ros's voice but I am looking forward to her solo debut. I have no idea what it will sound like but she is my favorite member.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I hope Jihyo from Twice gets a jazz-pop release for her solo. She is a really good dancer so could do something with that as well. But we have Dean, Zion.T, and Crush. It is about time we have an R&amp;B/Jazz girl among them as well (Ofc we have Heize but that is not enough)! I think a [Joss Stone-Baby Baby Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-KMSh3B1n8) sound is perfect for her.

Lastly, I hope Jihyo from Twice gets a jazz-pop release for her solo. She is a really good dancer so could do something with that as well. But we have Dean, Zion.T, and Crush. It is about time we have an R&amp;B/Jazz girl among them as well (Ofc we have Heize but that is not enough)! I think a [Joss Stone-Baby Baby Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-KMSh3B1n8) sound is perfect for her.

I went to KCON NY last year, and this year's convention/concert really blew it out of the water (besides logistical/organizational issues with the new venue). Honestly this is probably super rambley and not very informative, but I wanted to get all my thoughts out about my experience!

# Pre KCON/Check In

People had started camping for Saturday GA on Thursday. Although KCON had officially announced they would hand out wristbands Saturday morning, they started handing out wristbands early due to all the people lined up outside of MSG. It turned into a whole mess, as people were unsure if the wristbands were official/would be honored, and MSG staff and KCON staff didn't see to have the same information. It was eventually confirmed that the wristbands were official, which started a whole other mess with people who wouldn't be arriving to KCON until later.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I had Platinum tickets, and arrived Friday morning for early check in. Platinum came with two hi touches each, and I also bought a third one (lol), as I wanted hi touches for The Boyz, SF9 and Ateez. We both managed to get the hi-touches we wanted with minimal trading/selling involved thankfully! - I pulled SF9, Ateez and G-idle  and my friend pulled SF9 and Ateez. I sold my G-idle and bought The Boyz for a minimal loss. Ateez seemed to be the most popular group - their hi touches were selling for crazy amounts, up to $500.

# Klub KCON

Outside of check in, people had already started lining up for Klub KCON, as Ateez were headlining. Everglow was supposed to be there as well, but they had visa issues that kept them from attending KCON at all :(. Overall, Klub KCON wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really *that* enjoyable until Ateez came on. 

* I wasn't a huge fan of the DJ (his drops and excessive use of air horns). He did choose some good songs though
* Esna, Ellen &amp; Brian and Kevin Woo all performed and were fantastic, but their sets were really short.
* Jun and Jongup made a special appearance to say hi!
* Ateez were absolutely AMAZING, but also had a ridiculously short set. They performed their cover dance medley from the tour and Illusion before saying goodbye.

# Convention (Day 1 + Day 2)

I ended up going to 6 of the 8 artist engagements - 5 times for hi touch, and 1 time for audience. This meant I basically spent all my time during convention waiting in lines for artist engagements. I walked through the convention expo like once or twice, and didn't attend any of the programming/panels. I kind of regret it, but it was also worth doing all the hi touches for my favorite groups (and getting into a new group)!

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try not to go into too much detail on each artist engagement, but if you want any more info on any of them, let me know! Overall, the artist engagements were really fun. The space for artist engagements felt more intimate than last year. Most groups had a quick Q&amp;A session, game, and then hi touch. At the end, they took photos with the crowd. Getting the hi touch was definitely worth the price.

* **The Boyz** \- The first artist engagement of the weekend! It was a little chaotic at first, as they let plat/diamond and GA into the hall at the same time. They ended up pushing GA back out to finish letting plat/diamond holders in. I was in the 2nd row on the right side. The Boyz became one of my top groups after No Air, and getting to see them up close in person was amazing. They are such a sweet and handsome group. The game they played was seeing who could blow up a balloon the largest in the given time period. One takeaway from the hi-touch: Juyeon has such MASSIVE hands!!
* **ATEEZ -** Ateez are *extremely* good with fan service. They also have this very...wild?/chaotic energy. I missed their US Tour, so I was really excited to see them at KCON. Hongjoong is such a good speaker and his English is really impressive. Their engagement started a little late, so they ended up skipping the game portion.
* **TxT -** I was in the audience for to record for my friend who bought a hi touch. They are absolutely adorable! Their game was to see who could eat a fruit roll up the fastest without using their hands. It didn't seem like Yeonjun and Taehyun realized you had to peel off the paper piece before eating lol and fans were shouting at them to take it off.
* **Verivery -** I didn't know Verivery at all besides listening to their title tracks and knowing Hoyoung, but I ended up with their hi touch as people were selling them super cheap :( It was one of the best decisions I made, because they are absolutely precious! They are so sweet and had such an infectious energy. They also played the fruit roll up game. You could really feel how excited they were to be there and I was instantly charmed. ~~So much for not stanning any more groups~~
* **AB6IX** \- The engagement started over 20 min late, as AB6IX had only landed \~1-2 hours before it was scheduled to start. Woojin's injury was worse than I expected - he was limping pretty badly on stage and seemed to be in pain. Even with their tight schedule and the injury, all the members brought a lot of energy to the engagement. They kept the Q&amp;A super short and skipped the game to make enough time for the hi touches. Side note: Donghyun and Woong are STUNNING in person.
* **SF9** \- The last hi touch of the weekend! I was looking forward to this all day, as they are also one of my top groups. I had just seen them in April on their world tour, but already missed them so much. SF9's artist engagement was probably my favorite - they are just so natural on stage and with the fans, it was such a casual atmosphere. They had a lot of fun with the Q&amp;A and the game (putting post it notes on each other and seeing who could get the most off by dancing). Inseong is such a natural MC, Esna was joking that she had nothing to do lol.

# CONCERT (Day 1)

**Overall:** Day 1 was an absolutely unforgettable experience. So many amazing performances!  Being barrier in the north pit on main stage ended up being the prime spot, as you got a lot of interactions with groups as they came off the stage. Most of the performances were also on the main stage this year. I was also really happy with how many special stages there were this year compared to last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Red Carpet:** The plat/diamond line for the concert was super disorganized. There was one line for plat/diamond + other red carpet holders. They let everyone in \~6:20pm and led everyone into a holding room (a small concert hall). They had everyone walk out row by row to the red carpet. The red carpet was in a small space backstage. Each group was up for a very brief time, but you could get a really close view of them. I unfortunately didn't have a great view, and could only really see things through my camera. [Here are a few photos](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-AqMfqVnksnJkMOvRYo4S0A1LY4NluZ2) of TxT and Ateez I managed to take! I ended up leaving halfway through the red carpet after The Boyz finished, as MSG security started randomly letting plat holders into the concert venue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre Concert:** I ended up at barrier at the corner of the main stage and catwalk. We were also directly behind the teleprompter, which made me feel super exposed lol. Diamond were supposed to have first entry - that clearly did not happen, since plat holders got in first. They ended up moving a lot of plat back from the barrier to let in all the diamond holders in. My friend and I were super lucky and didn't have to move. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Show:** Kevin Woo opened up the pre-show and performed! He is such a sweetheart and very talented.

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stages (Ateez + The Boyz):** Ateez started off the show on the main stage with a dance cover of **Sicko Mode** ([my fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Ux4dS8Iio)). Like I said before...Ateez have such a wild energy and it really shined in this cover. As soon as they finished, The Boyz immediately started their cover on the extended stage. They did a dance cover to **Bad Guy** and it was KILLER. The crowd was going crazy. Their movements are so clean and graceful. I saw the whole thing from the back, but it was still amazing. The performance ended with all of them falling on their backs and it kind of hurt to hear the thuds lmao.

&amp;#x200B;

**TxT:** TxT were the first group to perform, and they started off with **Crown** on the extended stage. I haven't seen a lot of their performances, and I was blown away! Their choreo is so clean, and they have such a youthful/fresh energy! They performed the rest of their songs on the main stage. **Our Summer** was such a sweet song and performance. **Blue Orangeade** is  my favorite songs of theirs, and it was so fun to watch live. The last performance was the English version of **Cat &amp; Dog**, which I never listen to, so I kept getting thrown off by the lyrics haha. Hearing the whole arena barking along to the song was....quite the experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stage (IZ\*ONE):** They played a quick VCR of IZ\*ONE members and their hidden charms. IZ\*ONE were actually waiting to go on stage right in front of us, and we got to interact with them a bit as they watched their VCR. Once it finished, they went up to the extended stage and performed **Highlight.** I don't know a lot about IZ\*ONE, but they are gorgeous and Highlight is such a bop.

&amp;#x200B;

**ATEEZ:** Ateez started off their set with **Aurora** on the main stage. Aurora is my favorite song off the album and the choreo is amazing. The choreo has some pretty sexy moves and they go so hard with them (San especially). They went straight to **Wave** afterwards and moved to the main stage halfway through. They performed **Say My Name** and then ended with **Hala Hala**. I was a little disappointed to see Hala Hala from the back as its my favorite Ateez song hands down, but it was still a great experience. Ateez put so much energy and power into the performances.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boyz:** Before I had time to finish processing Ateez, The Boyz started their performance on the main stage. Safe to say, I went a little crazy when they started with **No Air** ([my fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xdkqX7R3HI): warning for bad and loud singing). No Air was the song that made my instantly fall in love with the Boyz and I've had it on repeat since it came out. It is one of my top songs of the year. Seeing it performed live (and so close!) was a dream come true. I screamed so loudly at one point that Hwall looked over and laughed lol. After a short talk, they started **Right Here.** Right Here isn't my favorite title track, but the choreo is sooo good. They moved to the extended stage halfway through, and then finished off their set with **Bloom Bloom**. Bloom Bloom is such an uplifting song. Seeing the jumping move during pre-chorus from the back was so cute!

* Story time: I made a sign for Q and planned to hold it up during their performances. During their talk between No Air and Right Here, I was trying (and failing) to get it out of my bag that had fallen on the floor. I was so pressed against the barrier that there wasn't a comfortable way to take it out. I FINALLY grab it it and whip it out and my friend is laughing at me. Turns out Changmin had seen my struggle getting the sign out! He was laughing and waved at me a few times. Never have I felt so embarrassed yet successful as a fan. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stage (NU'EST - Baekho and Minhyun):** Baekhyun and Minhyun had a duet, covering Lost Stars (Maroon 5). I was ready to cry, it was such a beautiful stage. They looked ETHEREAL and they have such honey vocals, it was overwhelming. SO MANY EMOTIONS.

&amp;#x200B;

**IZ\*ONE:** IZ\*ONE had the stage next!  Their first song was **Airplane** (which I hadn't listened to before). It was such a cute and fun performance! During the talk segment, IZ\*ONE were the only group to play any games the first night. They played the Telepathy game, and then had a random dance play (aka Chaeyeon owning the stage). The second song was **Violeta**, which I LOVE. They went right into **Rumor** before moving to the extended stage. Rumor is such a FIERCE song. **La Vie En Rose** was next (a bop), and then they ended their set with **Nekkoya**. It felt like an IZ\*ONE concert with all the songs they performed and all the cheers! I never followed Produce 48  and had only listened to IZ\*ONE's title tracks, but I really fell in love with them after KCON. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stage (The Boyz):** The Boyz had a second special stage, doing a cover of BTS's **Fire.** They absolutely killed the cover. They put so much energy and power into the performance and definitely did the song justice. Sunwoo doing Yoongi's rap...fantastic. It was a little overwhelming being so close to the stage for the performance, it was so intense.  Juyeon and Hyunjae were exceptionally handsome. Hopefully they release a dance practice for the cover, as the livestream  camerawork did not do the performance justice. I thought I was recording the performance, but didn't realize until the end that in my excitement I had accidentally stopped recording after 5 seconds..

&amp;#x200B;

**NU'EST:** The last performers...the headliners of the night - NU'EST! I wouldn't call myself a LOVE, but I really do love NU'EST and their music - I started following them casually after Broduce. I never thought I would see them in person, so having the chance to see them perform at KCON was a blessing. The first song was **Bet Bet.**..such a sexy jam. All of them really own the song. They had a quick talk and then moved to **Love Paint,** which is tied for my favorite title track alongside Overcome. They moved to the extended stage and performed **Segno**, which made me tear up a little. Such a beautiful song. The fourth performance was **Look (**also a bop - NU'EST have so many damn good songs).  They moved back to the main stage and ended the show with **R.L.T.L.** I absolutely lost it when the song started, as R.L.T.L. is my favorite NU'EST track hands down and I was NOT expecting to see it live! Wow, it was fantastic. It really makes me want to see NU'EST perform again, so I hope that they will tour one day/I can see them in Korea. Side note: Minhyun looks like a work of art when he sweats and it is ridiculous lol. Minki was also so sweet during the performances, smiling and waving at fans.  ~~No Overcome was a travesty~~

# CONCERT (Day 2)

**Overall:** Still unforgettable, but a little more stressful. Got to deal with a *lot* of fansites in my pit, so that was fun. Security did not know how to deal with them.

**Red Carpet:** I had a better view the second day and managed to take photos of all the groups as they weren't letting people leave early ([you can find them here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10731AfgJD6Fdbl89NYPkrpiTwQ2XfeZm)).

* Pros - They gave plat holders numbered wristbands (they should've just done this from the beginning)
* Cons - 1) They did not give prior notice about wristbands, 2)They let the red carpet line in over an hour earlier than Day 1 (also without notice)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Concert:** KCON ended up moving all the diamond holders into the north pit the second night, where plat/diamond had initially been split evenly between the north and south pits (the reasoning being that the north pit had the better view/more artist interactions, which was true). I still had a fantastic view, but I couldn't help being a little salty about it (for selfish reasons).  I was 2nd/3rd row in front of the catwalk and surrounded by a LOT of fansites (mostly Seventeen). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Show:** Esna opened up the show Day 2! I really love Esna - she was a fantastic and funny host for Klub KCON and various artist engagements. She is also SO talented and I adore her vocals. She has such a confidence on stage as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stages (AB6IX + Verivery):** AB6IX (minus Woojin) did a dance cover to Charlie Puth's **Attention**. They're all such great performers (and all legs lol)! Verivery followed with a dance cover of Bruno Mar's **24k Magic**. The video I took of the performance is basically me going ""THEY'RE SO CUTE!"" over and over (which they really are!)

&amp;#x200B;

**fromis\_9:** The first set of the night! fromis\_9 are honestly the group I knew the least amount/listened to the least from the line up. But they were really cute and did a great job!  They are all so pretty and talented. They performed **RUMPUMPUM** first, which was probably my favorite song. After a quick talk, they performed **Fun!**, **DKDK** and **Love Bomb**. fromis\_9 have a lot of really cute and catchy songs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stage (Seventeen):** As soon as I saw the rockets appear on the screen,  I started tapping my friendly frantically on her shoulder going, ""ROCKET, IT'S ROCKET"".  I was so excited about seeing Vernon and Joshua perform **Rocket** that I didn't notice performance unit come on stage! I thought they were backup dancers at first until I was like, ""Wait a second..isn't that Chan?"" After Rocket, performance unit stayed on stage and performed **Moonwalker.** Moonwalker is probably my favorite performance unit song and it did not disappoint live. Performance unit is just so...mesmerizing to watch.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verivery:** The first song they performed was their latest comeback, **From Now**. I've never watched their performances before and they really blew me away! They are such fantastic and energetic performers, with that same fresh energy as TxT. Like I mentioned before, they really have such an infectious energy. Hoyoung especially always looked like he was having the time of his life on stage. The second song was their debut, **Ring Ring Ring**. I really adore this song, and the performance was so much fun. The last performance was **Alright**, which I hadn't heard before but was super catchy. By the end of Verivery's set, I was ready to adopt them all. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AB6IX:** AB6IX started immediately with a dance intro before moving to **Breathe**. Woojin was seated on the side of the stage during their performance. As a Woojin stan, it really hurt to see him in pain and not able to perform with his members :(. AB6IX still did a fantastic job as 4! Breathe is one of my favorite debut songs (that ""I want to breathe"" prechorus gets me every time). After a talk segment with some random dances (and a signature Woong back flip), they performed **Shining Stars**. This is such a beautiful and sweet song and really got me emotional. At the end, all the members walked over to stand with Woojin. \*Cue the tears\* The last song they performed was **Hollywood**. They've come so far from their initial Broduce audition. Once again, it hurt to see Woojin not be able to perform, but he still gave it his all during his verses. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Stage (SF9):** SF9 had dropped hints during their artist engagement about their special stage being sexier than RPM, and I just had an inkling...Lo and behold, they did a cover of **Love Shot,** beautiful bright suits and all.  That performance was a wild ride and it will be etched in my mind forever lol. Taeyang covering Kai's part...the perfect choice. Taeyang is really the biggest exo-l. 

&amp;#x200B;

**(G)I-DLE:** My queens!! They walked onto that stage with so much confidence and charisma. Soyeon is honestly unreal and I could not keep my eyes off her. They started with **Uh Oh.** which was fantastic. They all have such great stage presence! After a short talk, they moved to Hann and Latata. ~~EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT LATATA.~~ They closed off their set with **Senorita,** which I didn't like...until I saw it live. Now I'm a big fan. Their set felt too short - I hope to see them on tour one day! Side note: Yuqi was rocking that red/dark pink hair! 

&amp;#x200B;

**SF9:** There are no words to describe how much I adore SF9. Being able to see them twice within 3 months was absolutely crazy! They had a dance intro before going right into RPM. **RPM** has grown on me so much, and the dance is great. SF9 do so well with sexy/mature concepts. The center Zuho part where he controls all the members...art. After their introductions, they performed **O Sole Mio**. I was not expecting them to perform O Sole Mio at all, but considering it was my first comeback with SF9 I was extremely excited! Hearing everyone sing along made me so proud. ~~O Sole Mio deserved better.~~ ~~They performed~~ **~~Now or Never~~** ~~(aka~~ where Yoo Taeyang [made everyone his bitch](https://twitter.com/hwioon/status/1148051465686212609)) ~~and then ended their set with~~ **~~Play Hard~~**~~.  Play Hard is one of my favorite SF9 tracks! It is such a fun song and the perfect way to close out a show.~~

&amp;#x200B;

**Seventeen:** Last but not least...Seventeen. I honestly was not prepared to see Seventeen perform live for the first time and kind of blanked from being too excited. Their first song was **Getting Closer,** which is one of my favorite choreos. Seventeen are really so flawless when it comes to dance and synchronization. During their talk, they played a few games (and watched as some fansites were yanked out of the pit by security lol). The second performance was **Clap** which, like O Sole Mio, was completely unexpected.  Also like O Sole Mio, Clap was my first comeback!  They moved to the extended stage during Clap and then performed **Good To Me.** All I can say is, my eyes were blessed. Good To me is too good. The next song was again totally unexpected - their debut song, **Adore You**! What an adorable performance. The ending song, in classic Seventeen fashion, was **Aju Nice**. The whole crowd went crazy! I honestly should've expected it but I still fell for the fake ending and got aju niced. I was all sad that they had finished already, before almost having a heart attack when Aju Nice started again and Seventeen sprinted back on stage for one last round. They must have been exhausted considering they had just flown in from Hong Kong, but they still put 200% into every performance.

# ENDING

Thank you for reading my rambling! As exhausting as KCON was, it was totally worth it. The performances were fantastic, and it was great to be able to meet so many groups I follow/listen to. If you want any specific fancams/group photos, please let me know! I have many photos/videos to go through.",14,72

I swear there were actual official articles referring to her as GGs maknae, and now all the sudden its Sohyeon? It doesnt sound right to me. 

The second one has to do with another SM entertainment girl group, Red Velvet. At the end of Happiness, I always thought the song ended with Irene singing Are you happy? Uh! But I was listening to it a few minutes ago on my playlist and apparently she never says that at the end, only in the intro to the song. It actually ends with the girls yelling Happiness!.

I wouldn't consider myself a VIP, but in my opinion, there's no denying that Big Bang knows how to put on a live performance. They really know how to pump up a crowd and control the energy of a stadium. Most Kpop performances I've seen are just replicas of their last live performance. Idols usually won't make a live performance differ from one another. A live performance on one stage, is the same live performance on another stage. (maybe the introduction to a song will differ from stage to stage, but they will still stick to choreo once the song begins)

1.Here is where Big Bang differs from other idols, they will generally have a base choreography (this is the choreo you see in their dance practices) and then they will manipulate that base choreography to fit what stage they are performing on. Big Bang will always utilize ALL of the space on a stage. The base choreography will still be there, but it will change to take up all the space available on stage. ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz-xSjAhT-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz-xSjAhT-w) vs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGZZxgixkew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGZZxgixkew))

2.My favorite place in where they differ is how they hype up the crowd constantly throughout a performance. Other groups will depend on their presence to ensure that the crowd is hyped. While Big Bang's presence is definitely enough for hype, they are still not shy to ad-lib constantly throughout a performance. Hype will make any performance amazing, and Big Bang knows how to hype up the crowd ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3AxP\_nsqZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3AxP_nsqZk) )

3.What I think is the last place where they differ to usual K-pop choreography is how they feature who is singing/rapping currently. Whoever is currently singing/rapping, they typically will have a base choreography, but it's still up to them how they move during their time to shine. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxqjsXjSKPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxqjsXjSKPk))

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Big Bang's live performance are lit because they have FREEDOM to perform how they want.

What are some other Live Performance's that resemble the type of energy this formula creates? One that comes to my mind is when BTS performed Cypher 4 @MAMA2017 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVHcXZK7pKs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVHcXZK7pKs)",2,0

SNSD's tenth anniversary is a prime example. The title tracks and album were strong, but everything about the promotion--or lack thereof--left a bitter taste in a lot of SONE's mouths. First only one week of performing (Yuri was injured though so this is understandable), the lack of album production, and overall the way SM handled everything really put a damper on such a big milestone for the girls. Mr. Mr. era is another case of weird shit happening in the background that, while it didn't completely ruin the era, certainly made it feel like a strange one.

I really enjoyed the music from NCT 127's latest comback, but a lot of the ugly sides of the NCTzen fandom came to light this past era and that's significantly made my memories less fond. Not winning on music shows is frustrating, but there really wasn't a need for all the finger pointing and unit fighting and overall nastiness going on. I could go on a whole rant about this, but the long story short is that the fandom needs to stop blaming everything on ""lazy"" NCTzens. SM not paying for ads to increase views (hence the slower gain) + disjointed promotional schedule + traditionally lower Korean digitals + strong digital competitors + WJSN's huge Chinese fanbase (trust me, the real money is in China--hit the jackpot there and you're golden) were the main reasons why the boys only won twice, NOT because the fans were too lazy or because all Dreamzens and WayVzens supposedly want to sabotage 127.  It was also sad to see some of the boys clearly injured and struggling, yet they had to keep performing on music shows and traveling all the time since they were still touring. 

So what other comebacks made you feel this way? How did external stuff make you remember the era less favorably?",168,141

1644,2019-7-12,2019,7,12,13,cc5y11,Will a new SM boy group be possible?,starryharu,1562904476,"Ever since about a year after NCT's entire concept was revealed to the public, there's always been this one lingering question in my mind: will a new SM boy group actually be created after NCT?

Obviously it is WAY too early to be thinking about this, since SM has not even released a new girl group after RV being active for quite a while. However, it's still interesting to think about. Obviously there are still trainees coming into SM. how would the male trainees be handled once debut time comes around? The average time in between group debuts has been about 1.5 years for SM groups. Realistically, a new girl group would debut late 2019 if we are lucky, or 2020. So by 2021-2022, SM would generally be gearing up for a new boy group if they continue the trend.

But with the concept of NCT, would they just debut a new unit under NCT that is solidly promoted and has little to no member switches (like NCT 127)? Or would they debut a boy group outside the NCT brand? 

Personally, with this entire unlimited member thing that NCT has going on, it seems that SM will just be adding new members into the group yearly with the NCT yearbook, and that they'll disregard making a new boy group for a while. However, there are a fair amount of people that dislike NCT's concept and just want a new boy group. Even then, SM is notorious for adding random units to their groups that just disappear over time (I think SHINee was the only boy group without any units that SM had in the 2000s). So even if a ""regular boy group"" was debuted, knowing SM, there would probably be some units either in the beginning or in the future.

They have this mature maknae thing going on, and their smiles look very student council-like idk what im sayin they just look like the types teachers will entrust the class to if theyre not around

Do you think the rise of streaming and social is a big factor for today's groups gigantic numbers of followers and viewers? It has to be, right? 

And for me it's F(x) through and through. 

Think back to 2009 and just look at the ensemble and to me it was something so different. 

A Chinese goddess of dancing and incredibly charismatic in Victoria
An androgynous badass girl with a deep voice and amazing presence and personality in Amber
An amazing vocalist with a voice to die for and that doesn't really fit Korean standards in Luna
A quirky and loveable personality and charisma that embodies Sully
The star power and talent of Krystal

They are freaking incredible and to me never received the proper respect and adoration that they deserve, especially from SM. 

There's still nothing like F(x) in the industry to me.

Theres been a few interesting events/scandals this year but it all feels.. bleak. 2018 KPop was a lot more entertaining and fun for me. However, 2019 KPop isnt that bad. Im just underwhelmed by a lot of the music and action so far. Most of the summer comebacks have gotten a meh from me, debuts have felt dry, my ults have put out some just ok comebacks. Bleh. Am I the only one? Maybe its the absence of my other favorite groups like EXO and Shinee.",70,0

&amp;#x200B;

I'll do TWICE for this one with LOONA's solos.

&amp;#x200B;

Vivid - I'd give this to Nayeon honestly, I can just picture her wearing the red suit that Heejin wears in the MV. Her voice seems perfect for Vivid and both of them are represented by bunnies and were the first ones confirmed to be in their groups.

New - This one seems like a good fit for Jeongyeon as her voice seems good for the song. This is one of my favorites and it seems like Jeongyeon would be an amazing candidate for this song.

Eclipse - I have to give this one to Momo, Eclipse seems perfect for her. If you think she doesn't have the vocals necessary for this song, just look at Sixteen or their Move stage.

Love Cherry Motion - Sana is usually portrayed as the cutesy type in TWICE and since Choerry and her are pretty much the epitome of sunshine, they still have that side of duality to them. This song seems perfect to showcase Sana's duality and she could pop off when the bass drops.

Heart Attack - Main vocalists rise! Heart Attack is honestly perfect for Jihyo, she has the vocals to pull it off honestly. I couldn't see anyone else in TWICE singing this.

Let Me In - I know Mina isn't one of the best vocalists in TWICE, but she seems like she could pull off Let Me In really well. I can't really imagine anyone else but Mina singing this honestly. This seems like a concept that could fit Mina more than TWICE's usual concept.

One &amp; Only - Dahyun and Go Won seem like decent rappers, One &amp; Only is honestly perfect for Dahyun because the song just gives off a really cute and precious vibe. Dahyun would totally be able to pull this off.

Singing In The Rain - Chaeyoung would honestly pop off during SITR, I really want that collab stage between JinSoul and Chaeyoung (BBC please). We all know Chaeyoung can sing and rap, this solo is perfect for her.

Around You - Tzuyu and Hyunjin pretty much look alike and a concept like this could fit Tzuyu more than the usual concepts she does. Aside from that, they're both visuals and my OnceBit heart needs a HyunTzu interaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus:

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I Love You - I could see Tzuyu doing this with Dahyun doing Haseul's part.

Kiss Later - Honestly just give this one to Nayeon and let her act like the maknae for this song.

Egoist - Momo and Chaeyoung could definitely pull this one off, Momo doing Olivia Hye's part while Chaeyoung raps.

**RULES**

- no dating until after debut

- no smoking

- no toasters and ovens cause I'm terrified of them

- you must attend counseling (at least) Once every 2 weeks. Even if you think your okay.

- after every comeback promotion is done, mandatory 1 week break of chilling. (Absolutely no CF/endorsements, no social media posting unless you want to, no need to wear makeup or bras during this time.)
 
- no vinegar. Smells and tastes like shit.

- No Seungri oppalogists 

- gays and trans peeps only. Bi/curious/queer are allowed cause *everyone* in the LGBT community is valid




**How our music style would be like**


Dance/party Music. Just something to lift your spirits up and makes you wanna move. Probably more vocal-based like Mamamoo or 15&amp;, with a mix of Blackpink, itzy, twice, and CLC.",25,0

1782,2019-7-13,2019,7,13,4,ccfiqp,Why is Hwasa the only succesful soloist from Mamamoo so far?,MaxwellSH,1562960106,"I love Hwasa and she is my bias and a queen but why is she the only ""real"" succesful soloist from Mamamoo?

As we know Mamamoo is already 5 years old(time flies fast :D) and after the 7th year they won't have as many comebacks and probably focus on solo work/acting. In fact they have already started their solo careers with members debuting one after another. 

They usually have solo tracks in their group albums but don't have MVs for them. In fact Hwasa even had a solo song in their debut album called ""I Do Me""(great hip hop song btw). 

So let's have a look at their solos so far:
1. Solar
-She has not had her debut so far but she has an album with remakes of old songs from veterans in South Korea. Also stream ""Honey Bey"" it's iconic :D.

2. Wheein
-Wheein debuted on April 2018 with the digital single ""Easy"" featuring Sik-K. The song did well for a debut and peaked at number 36 on the Gaon Digital Chart. She also released the song ""25"" on 25th of May 2019 and it didn't do well because it was an unexpected comeback and limited promotions didn't help either ;(.

3. Moonbyul 
-Moonbyul debuted on may 2018 with ""Selfish"" featuring Seulgi of RedVelvet. The song peaked at number 84 on the Gaon Digital Single Chart and it became quite popular on Youtube reaching 15 milion views so far. International fans of Mamamoo and RedVelvet loved the song and it was overall well received. 

4. Hwasa
-Hwasa debuted recently in February 2019 with the single ""Twit"". As we all know the song was well received and peaked at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and on number 3 on the Billboard US World Digital Songs chart. The debut was extremely succesful and it even received a music show win on Music Core. 

Conclusion: To me it seems like with each debut they are becoming more and more succesful and they all have very different styles and genres and ""Twit"" was a pop song with elements of the house genre(something pretty popular in kpop rn). I hope all the other members achieve success with their solo work and I hope it doesn't turnout to be a Miss A-Suzy situation. Hwasa is really popular and her personality is adored by fans. Not all of them can be succesful but Hwasa has been doing pretty well while the others can't really pass the success of Mamamoo. To me Hwasa's video/song/promotions were all excellent but I hope the other members are also treated well.

I dont regularly listen to much GOT7 music, but I recently realized that I could easily tell that a song is a GOT7 song despite never even hearing it before, because of their voice colors. Teen Top is also a fairly distinct group to me, mostly because of Niel, Chunji, and Ricky (L.joe too, before he left).

As for ggs, 2ne1 and Blackpink all collectively have pretty distinct voices, though I think thats true for pretty much every YG artist. Red Velvet also have very distinguishable and recognizable voices.

On the flipside, there are also groups that have pretty generic voice colors to me, like Up10tion and GFriend. I actually listen to and like their music *a lot*, but sometimes I keep thinking theyre another group bc I cant quite remember their voices",239,103

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently writing a research article about localization and conflict in relation to Japanese-Korean collboration within K-pop, specifically TWICE and Iz\*One. I would be glad if some would like to share their thoughts on the questions below, so I could use that as a complementary methodological/data perspective in triangulation research. Morover, I am using other data, content analysis, a literature review, and have contacted the companies to comprehensively answer my research questions.

&amp;#x200B;

 1. Which business strategies have been used to market TWICE and Iz\*One in Japan? Besides Japanese versions of songs and music videos, are there any specific strategies used? How do they differ from those used in South Korea and other countries?  
 

2. Was IZ\*One and TWICE consciously formed of Japanese members to increase revenues in Japan? If so, has this business strategy succeeded this far relative to for instance Girls' Generation (which was successful in Japan but did not include any Japanese members)?  
 

3.  
 A) How large are TWICE's and Iz\*One's concert ticket revenues in Japan relative to South Korean concert ticket revenues?  
 

B) How large are TWICE's and Iz\*One's music-related merchandise revenues in Japan relative to South Korean music-related merchandise revenues?  
 

4. Will attempts to penetrate the lucrative Western markets, like the U.S. and UK, be made in the aftermath of the success of BTS and BLACKPINK or will TWICE and Iz\*One remain more of regionally successful groups?  
 

5. How have nationalist-related incidents, like a Korean fan threatening members been solved? Are these kinds of incidents rare or something to be expected in connection to a Japanese/Korean group constellation? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If an artist usually gets 800k+ UL, lets say but a newly released song gets 400k UL, does that mean they flopped? What if they chart out after half the time they usually do is it a flop even though it is still comparably good next to their peers? What if an artist releases a very unpublic friendly song and it does poorly because of that? Is flopping just falling off the chart in two hours regardless of who it is. 

How do you define it?",12,0

I want him to moo into my fat, meaty cunt while I eat his small, Asian cock like a hamburger. This can't just be me, right?

Everglow's debut proved to also be quite successful considering they come from Yuehua Entertainment. They went against people's expectations of a cutesy concept and everyone seemed to love ""Bon Bon Chocolat"". Now that ITZY is set to come back at the end of the month and the hype for them is still there (imo), do you think that people will still be hyping for Everglow whenever they comeback? (And also what do you think their future looks like?)

I hate to compare GGs with each other but that's hard to not do considering they both had successful debuts and proved to be favorite rookies of many people. ITZY's success somewhat seems fortified because of JYP (you never know). Will Everglow be able to become big and effectively establish themselves as a girl group of the upcoming generation?

P.S. I so hope they do because I really like the members and their music. Their song ""Moon"" is still one of my favs.",28,51

So what do I mean when I say live vocal performances? Videos of their live singing includes radio shows, tv/music shows, vlives, concerts, recordings, etc where they sing the entire song live with little to no choreography.. Some choreo is fine as long as it doesn't take their focus away from singing too much. I even included some music show win encores where I think they sang adequately instead of messing around too much which idols tend to do instead. So without further ado, this is what i've got so far. Please do help me fill in the blanks if possible

&amp;#x200B;

I am a researcher (and K-pop entusiast since 2009) in education and East Asian studies, and two of my articles on K-pop have passed the peer review process and will be published online in October 2019 and March 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next research article which related to K-pop is about localization strategies of TWICE and Iz\*One in Japan and Korea, as well as some nationalist-related quarells related to fans or online trolls. I chose two groups as two case studies because they provide a partly new concept with a strong presence of both Korean and Japanese  members. This is interesting in the light of some researchers who think that there is a growing suspicion between Korean and Japanese people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, this far I have written about 8000 words and used a literature review, studied online sources related to my research questions, carried through content analysis of the two groups' material (music videos, live performances etc.), and completed a small observation study in Tokyo. My aim is to, in addition, obtain more information and perspectives from fans and the group's companies. Therefore, I would wish as many as people to provide serious answers and reflections to the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

  

1. Which business strategies have been used to market TWICE and IZ One in Japan? Besides Japanese versions of songs and music videos, are there any specific strategies used? How do they differ from those used in South Korea and other countries?  
 

2. Was TWICE and Iz\*One consciously formed of three Japanese members to increase revenues in Japan? If so, has this business strategy succeeded this far relative to for instance Girls' Generation (which was successful in Japan but did not include any Japanese members)?  
 

3.  
 A) How large are TWICEs and IZ One's concert ticket revenues in Japan relative to South Korean concert ticket revenues?  
 

B) How large are TWICEs and IZ One's music-related merchandise revenues in Japan relative to South Korean music-related merchandise revenues?  
 

4. Will attempts to penetrate the lucrative Western markets, like the U.S. and UK, be made in the aftermath of the success of BTS and BLACKPINK or will TWICE and IZ One remain more of regionally successful groups?  
 

5. How have nationalist-related incidents, like a Korean fan threatening members been solved? Are these kinds of incidents rare or something to be expected in connection to a Japanese/Korean group constellation?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bjrn from Sweden",26,57

Interestingly, the group has gone through a number of lineup changes since debut, with debut member Li-G leaving shortly after the group's debut, and then other founding member Ejin leaving prior to the group's ""[Maybe Maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By-mFuKijS0)"" comeback.

Current members Aya and Hyein joined during the group's ""This Night"" comeback, while Rookie and Hajin joined the group started with the group's ""[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwdH0PuuRw)"" comeback, which was released under ATO Entertainment.

This will be the group's first comeback under the revamped name of Melody Pink.

There's little about the group in English, unfortunately, and I haven't been able to find SNS sites for the group either.

[**VANNER Comeback Celebration Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_vanner_02)

* Date Project Ends: August 26, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Vanner?

VANNER is a five member boy group signed  to VT Entertainment. Their group name comes from the combination of **V**ictory and B**anner**, a representation of putting a banner at the top of a flagpole - a traditional symbol of victory.

While the group spent time in Japan doing pre-debut promotions throughout January  2019, their official debut was with the song ""[Better Do Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S_yxj9UPWg)"", which was released on February 13, 2019.

This will be their first comeback since debut.

While not much is known about the group due to their newness, here are a few interesting things I was able to come across:

* Taehwan was previously a Pledis trainee, and supposedly in the pre-debut lineup of Seventeen.
* Hyeseong taught Minhyuk of D-CRUNCH in dancing.

[**WEGIRLS Comeback Celebration Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_wegirls_02)

* Date Project Ends: August 29, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

WeGirls is a six member group signed to Aftermoon Corp. The group ran a [successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_wegirls/updates) for their debut, with plans to debut as a nine member group. However, prior to the group's official debut, there was a massive lineup change, with 6 members leaving the group, 1 being added...then leaving, and then five new members being added to make up the debut lineup. The group finally debuted as eight members on August 30, 3018 with the song ""[On Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=&amp;v=XJkVwcU68Yo)"".

The group's fandom name is Wings.

This will be their first comeback since debut, though with a smaller lineup. Original member HaL [announced](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/02/hal-announces-her-departure-from-wegirls-after-less-than-a-year-since-debuting) her departure from the group in February 2019, while original member Hyeni quietly left the group prior to the launching of this Makestar.

[**Saturday Chart Climbing Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_saturday_01)

* Date Project Ends: August 30, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Saturday?

Saturday is a seven member group signed to SD Entertainment. Their fandom name is Sunday, a play on their group name being one of the days of the week in English.

The group debuted July 18, 2018 with the song ""[MMok JJi BBa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tJ1k7AP-o)"", though member Chaewon left later that year to pursue her studies. Current member Juyeon was added to replace her.

The group came to slightly more prominence with their comeback song ""[Wi-Fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L8FXg8zbDA)"", though member Sunha would announce her departure from the group once promotions were over.

New member Minseo was added to the group in April 2019 to replace Sunha, and this upcoming comeback will be her first with the group.

With the current lineup, Saturday released a special song on June 21, 2019, a cover of Hari's ""[(Gwiyomi Song)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYumUDNryjw), though it wasn't intended to be a proper comeback single.

First, sorry for missing last week's Jukebox  I have been traveling the past couple of weeks and have not had time to really sit down and work on this feature. I also have nothing planned so I'm just going to be making up this song list in the next 10-ish minutes of free time I have, here we go! 

I'll try choosing songs that are both recent and somewhat relevant but also maybe underappreciated? Here we go! These are this week's songs:

1. [MV] [Red Velvet - Zimzalabim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnGBb1wg98)
2. [ATEEZ - Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIInyEWWW-s)

Want to participate in this week's Jukebox? Here's a quick guide! Each week you get the chance to review seven songs on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is NOT invited, and 10 being this song made you throw all your worries over the flat earth! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

Especially when it was a group I like (I watched every live performance of Twice during the What is Love?era lol). Almost felt like following sports in a way? But sometimes I feel bad for the artists since that is known to be an especially brutal schedule going from music show to music show for 3 or so weeks. Also I would imagine psychologically the competitiveness could affect you. Do you have any thoughts on this? Do think your experience with Kpop would be different without music shows?,11,5

*Disclaimer: May include spoilers and this is from the perspective of a Once so my opinions might not be the most conclusive*

**PRE-CONCERT**
It was a SUPER hot day, even by Singapore standards but the crowds were insane. Thank goodness for the crowd control and neat queues. The merch started selling at 10am and everything was gone by 10:30 lmao - but there were a lot of resellers nearer to the start of the concert. Observation: Dahyun and Momo merch seemed to sell the best.

The venue is really nice and air-con (thank goodness) and I had a Cat 2 seat on the 2nd level, which was pretty decent in terms of the view I got. They started off by softly playing their B-sides in their background (I was definitely bopping along to FFW and Sunset), then ramped it up to pretty much full volume for the final B-side, which was Look At Me. At this point, the crowd was crazy and everyone was chanting along to the songs. They played a few VCRs and CFs to tide the crowd along and let me just say, the visuals in the VCRs are no joke. I might have passed out at this point. 

**CONCERT ITSELF**
So the girls appeared from the stage and let me tell you, the screams were INSANE. And somehow, all the pictures you see online dont do justice to the girls at all. Seeing them in real life was OTHERWORLDLY. The girls started in black outfits and the first few songs were Stuck in My Head (complete with flames spewing from the stage), Cheer Up (I went deaf from the SHY SHY SHY chants), BDZ and Yes or Yes. Every time they stopped to talk to the crowd,, the screams were even louder. For the front part, I dont know if it was just me, but the girls seemed a little down, ESPECIALLY when it was Minas parts. 

After that, they changed into black/gold outfits (???) as part of their theme of showing different colours of themselves. They then sang  their cover I Want You Back and wow their English has improved TONS. The DTNA remix was fire as usual and by then you could see the girls getting red in the face from all the dancing and singing and jumping - no filters to make them look like Snow White here!!

A ethereal VCR then played while the crowd tried to calm themselves down. The girls were in this dreamlike place, all wearing white while staring into the camera. Again I nearly fainted. The girls reappeared in gorgeous white dresses and stood in a circle facing the crowd. Closest thing to angels Ive ever seen. After Moon started playing and the crowd was a sea of green Candy Bongs (Minas colour). All of them started tearing up, but Jihyo most notably so. When she tried to cover Minas part, she burst into tears. One of the most emotional songs of the concert and the performance gave me so many goosebumps. Definitely a highlight. 

The girls took a pause and addressed the crowd, with the help of a translator. The next song was You in My Heart and boy I tell you, this song was another emotional wreck. Everyone in the stadium waved their phone torchlights and the place looked surreal. Between the white dresses and the sea of lights, this was one of the most majestic scenes Ive ever witnessed. Jihyo was full on sobbing at this point. They did a complete 180 and performed Sunset next. Following which, it was time for an acoustic version of Heart Shaker. Probably the most touching moment of the concert was when their faces showed up on the screen one by one as they sang their parts, but Minas window remained a stationary pictures. Damn those onions. The song cut halfway as we transitioned into the Red phase of the concert.

Heart Shaker continued with a more mature vibe and the crowd loved it. Strawberry was next and the crowd lapped up the slightly risque routines and lyrics. No one was prepared for the unit stages though...

Dahyun, Sana and Tzuyu - Dance for You by Beyonce 
Jihyo and Momo - Goodbye by Taemin
NaJeongChae - Born This Way by Lady Gaga

Im gonna skip the discussion on the above stages because I could go on forever but damn. 

A VCR with the girls singing along to Turn It Up was next and it was so fun and cute (also my favourite B-side). Likey and What is Love were pretty standard but the crowd during the killing parts were THUNDEROUS. They then split into units to discuss their special stages!! Highlights include Jihyo talking about Momos pigtails (I thought we were doing a cool concept, but then I saw Momo walk out in pigtails) and proceeding to imitate her. Ooh-Ahh, TT and Fancy were next and at this point, I could tell the girls were pretty tired.

The girls disappeared behind stage for a bit and re-emerged with comfy tour t-shirts and skirts. They performed Signal (which SG loved). Then came the surprise fanmade VCR. It showed the past three years of Twice coming to Singapore and all their past experiences. It showed the BEST variety moments (Sana and Jihyos Weekly Idol segment with headphones on, Momos 7 hour Vlive, Sana trying to eat chilli crab, and Momos circle hand sign) and even a black and white vid of Mina explaining her dream of being a singer. It thanked Twice for everything theyve done and to top it off, the BGM was After Moon, Be As One and One in a Million. There wasnt a dry eye at this point. The girls took turns to speak one by one and a common theme was the promise and insistence theyd be back as 9. Knock Knock came next and everyone had tons of fun. 

For the encore, they sang Stuck, my favourite from the WIL album. It was emotional, to say the least. 

The concert, their first as 8 members, was a true emotional rollercoaster. 




**OBSERVATIONS**
- Nayeon has the best English by far!!!
- All the girls vocals seemed to be pitched slightly higher
- Chaeyoung is BUFF
- The girls sang nearly every single song live - which is no mean feat considering their choreo and setlist
- the crowd cheered the loudest during VCRs when Mina appeared on the screen
- Dahyun talking to the crowd in English was the cutest and funniest thing Ive seen in a while. 
- ALL the girls took turns to cover Minas lines. My favourite was when Dahyun did so
- There was this really cute fan segment that involved crowd participation to get the girls back on stage for the encore
- Their live vocals are no joke",21,173

TWICE's Tzuyu: Languages

Tzuyu can speak Mandarin, Taiwanese, and Korean, she's also learning Japanese along with some other members. I've always wanted to be a polyglot and that Chinese class I took might pay off.

Red Velvet's Wendy: Singing

I'd gladly let Wendy teach me how to sing if it means I don't sound like a dying goat. 

Stray Kids' Bang Chan: Athletics

I am not athletic whatsoever. Hopefully Chan could help me try not to fail gym class.

Dreamcatcher's Yoohyeon: Gaming

I absolutely suck at video games, really need Yoohyeon to teach me how to git gud.

BTS' Suga: Producing/Composing

If Yoongi could teach me how to write and produce a song and make it not sound like something for a school talent show, I'd gladly accept.

(G)I-DLE's Soyeon: Rapping

Learning from the queen herself should get me some decent rapping skills so I'd be happy to learn from Soyeon.

LOONA's Olivia Hye: Dancing

Hyejoo snapped during Cherry Bomb so I'd consider her a decent teacher.",82,96

Whilst I understand that this article here [http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181011000876](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181011000876) says that BTS will ""definitely enlist"" this petition should not just be about giving BTS the choice. It should also be a friendly encouragement to BTS itself from ARMY. The views of millions of ARMYs, who would be really sad should their idols break up for military service, have not been represented in South Korea.

DISCLAIMER: I don't intend to speak with any authority and if BTS really want to enlist, we can't and shouldn't stop them. However, we need to try and in a polite and friendly way talk BTS out of military service and persuade them that they have already served their country so well culturally and bring in $3.6 B to South Korea annually. They don't need to serve their country militarily - they say something along the lines of ""oh it is inevitable as Koreans"" well I don't think that when BTS were children understanding that at some point in their lives they would have to enlist they thought that they would be no ordinary Koreans.

I also understand that BTS may want a break from singing. However, they can spend it in a civilian way - for example they could make videos that ARMYs could love. I am politely and in a friendly manner calling on BTS to reconsider their wish to not be excempted and to understand the wishes of the millions of ARMYs who do not want them out of the public eye for two years.

Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!

I was wondering as a fan, if it feels easier to have that kind of situation where you dont have to deal with the emotions of disbandment but you are waiting forever for a comeback that may never come. Or if its easier for the group to just disband and go through the grieving process and accept it. Any thoughts?",70,71

It's already uncomfortable that there exists a term and supposedly an official position called ""visual"" in many groups, but the fact that there are people who use the term ""visual hole"" is really bewildering. 

For the uninitiated, as the name suggests, a visual hole means... a particular member of a group who drags down their otherwise beautiful members with their ugliness. For example, many say that Dahyun and Jihyo are the visual holes of Twice, and that the group would have been ""perfect"" (in terms of beauty) if those two weren't ugly (or as beautiful as the others). 

First of all, Dahyun is cute as fuck, and I have never seen a woman as gorgeous as Jihyo. How superficial are these people? 

I feel gross that I share the same fandom with people who think like this. 

Anyone else had the same thought?",15,9

- The **Play Your KARD Right Tour** in New Delhi and Guwahati in India was announced on [June 5th](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bx2kad/kard_will_come_to_india_in_july_as_part_of_their/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app). I was not a fan of the group, but I decided to go to the show because KPop idols dont come to India very often! (This might change soon as **ATEEZ** and **Limitless** are rumoured to be arriving this year too.)

- The only KARD song I knew was [Oh NaNa](https://youtu.be/yPTcKSVAEvA). I had the option of cramming all their songs in the days leading up to the concert, or going to the show without any knowledge and turning it into a learning experience, and I decided to go without listening to anything to get fresh insight into the band and their music.

- There were three types of tickets available:

1. [Scouted](https://imgur.com/a/o3zay1E) - Just for watching the show at 1800

2. Scouted with perks - Including photo op and hi-touch for 3000

3. [Rookie](https://imgur.com/a/pQ5nQpq) - Including an album signing event along with the Ride on the Wind album for 7000

- Some fans went to the [airport](https://imgur.com/a/2G9gjSd) to greet the members, and they were [grateful](https://twitter.com/hiddenkardindia/status/1149048285870452741?s=21) to see the fans waiting for them well after midnight. They smiled and waved, and graciously accepted all fan gifts.

**Day of the Concert**

- The show was scheduled on a Friday at the Talkatora Stadium. The venue can hold up to [3035 people](https://imgur.com/a/088nZ9N), and is one of the most popular indoor stadiums in Delhi. A couple of [posters](https://imgur.com/a/k5LeELu) were placed around the entrance for the fans to take pictures with.

- The [schedule](https://imgur.com/a/2bkoQZY) for the concert was the same for both Delhi and Guwahati. However, there was a slight delay, and **KARD** themselves [arrived](https://imgur.com/a/iZi9r8T) at the venue some time after the fans had already been lined up for a while.

- The entry inside the venue started at 12 pm for the Rookie ticket holders, and the [album signing event](https://imgur.com/a/Yf7cXLg) took place till 2 pm. The signing went smoothly, and most of the fans [forgot what to say](https://twitter.com/kpophighindia/status/1149580934309539840?s=21) to KARD because they got so nervous! 

- The entry for the Scouted with perks ticket holders was next, and the [photo op and hi-touch](https://imgur.com/a/OpwYc9R) went by in a blur! (My friend was lucky enough to stand next to **B.M**)

- Finally, the entry for the Scouted ticket holders started at 4pm. I got my ticket, wristband, and a [media pass](https://imgur.com/a/fUNCQnK) because I was reviewing the concert for Pink Box events, the organisers.

- We waited for a few minutes in the hall while KARDs music videos were played on the screen. My [view](https://imgur.com/a/6cGud3C) was excellent.

- The organisers introduced the head of the Korean Cultural Center India (KCCI), who have been single-handedly responsible for bringing KPop bands in India ever since **N-Sonic** in 2014. This was followed by the singing of both the Indian and the Korean national anthem.

- The host hyped up the crowd and KARDs [introductory video](https://youtu.be/hAu8Lu-1Kyw) was played. The entire stadium erupted with cheers of K.A.R.D! 

- Even though unfortunately the show hadnt been completely sold out, the hall managed to look pretty packed. The majority of the concert attendees were girls in their teens and twenties. Many parents accompanying their children were also present.

-  KARD [arrived on stage](https://imgur.com/a/aL0Fpsb) to DEAFENING screams. It was like a nuclear bomb had went off in the auditorium! They were taken aback by the insanely loud cheering. They opened the concert with [Dont Recall](https://youtu.be/B8gTWgJ2c5U). Their energy was off the charts and their synchronisation was unbelievable. 

- They immediately launched into a performance of [Oh NaNa](https://youtu.be/eu3lRCnNCZo).  I enjoyed this performance the most because this was the only song I was vaguely familiar with. The fans knew all the fan chants and their glow sticks, posters, and swirling lights filled up the hall!

- This was followed by [Ride on the Wind](https://youtu.be/6j3gO8sqc6g). This song was one of the most well received of the night, and they delivered a flawless performance.

- They [introduced](https://youtu.be/dhPHoBCjOdk) themselves individually to the audience. Everybody screamed when they spoke Hindi, and the guys seemed delighted by the enthusiastic response. B.M interacted with us the most as he was the only English speaker, but J.Seph tried to communicate with the audience a lot as well. He was goofy and adorable, and he was the most playful with the fans. Somin and Jiwoo were very shy and looked nervously around the hall, trying to take it all in, but they became more comfortable and mellowed out as the concert progressed.

- They performed [You In Me](https://youtu.be/NU1yhz4sClA) next, and I was especially impressed by Jiwoos stable vocals and B.Ms dancing skills and insane charisma. J.Seph spat out his rap verses at lightning speed, and Somin was the most energetic and receptive to the fans reaction. 

- [Rumor](https://youtu.be/GJZ9hrz22y0) was up next, and it was also a fan favourite of the night. Everybody danced along standing at their seats, and even the security personnel seemed entranced!

- A [Q&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;A session](https://youtu.be/WKsy0aXqies) was up next. The members answered questions about their future plans (to keep on making music until they die), when they plan to return to India (whenever we call them back), who is the biggest eater in KARD (Somin pointed to J.Seph, who first pointed to the audience next to him, then pointed out to their manager standing down the stage lmao), and so on and so forth.

- Next, **B.M** danced to [Bom Diggy Digggy](https://youtu.be/9lvWU3YE618), a very popular Bollywood song. The screaming was so loud that I saw a cameraman flinch in surprise. 

- The [Q&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;A session](https://youtu.be/kXuaJ8Sr9r0) continued. Somin chose chicken curry, tandoori chicken, and naan as her favorite Indian food. B.M named the fans as his turning point in life, and J.Seph said that he found the optimism and positivity of Indian fans to be very charming.

- They performed [Hola Hola](https://youtu.be/qRE5lNHWwMc) up next, and this has since become my favorite KARD Song! The performance was airy, cheerful and effortless.

- J.Seph sang a few lines of [Tujhme Rab Dikhta Hai](https://youtu.be/JKBvnjSr0b0), a famous Bollywood song, at the fans request. He panicked initially and tried to persuade the other members to sing with him, but then he bravely sang all by himself. He was visibly touched when everybody sang along with him for a second time. B.M said that J.Seph was honoured that we sang with him, even though it wasnt his own song. Somin and Jiwoo could not stop laughing at the boys antics, it was hilarious!

- Next up, they performed [Knockin On My Heavens Door](https://youtu.be/QIscbSXfgjM). This was a memorable performance for me because I particularly loved the choreography for this song. 

- One of my favourite performances of the night was of an unreleased song called [Gidd Up](https://youtu.be/-y1SBcu8aAo). They were bursting with energy and dominated the stage!

- Thirty two of the Rookie ticket holders were chosen randomly for playing simple [games](https://youtu.be/L0t-QS7ejWs) with the group like arranging cups in the shortest time, and blowing balloons to knock over cups. A notable moment was B.M blowing a balloon hard enough to make it pop! It was hysterical. 

- A video by fans from all over India leaving them supportive messages was shown to KARD as a surprise, and they were very moved by the fans sincerity. B.M said that they had been to many countries all over the world, but it was the first time that people from all the states of a country had left them a video like that. All the members thanked us and J.Seph was nearly in tears again.

- A really smooth and elegant performance of [Dmelo](https://youtu.be/_uKAXBxDwa8) was up next.

- They performed [Mi Gente](https://youtu.be/5F5uh3gpT_s) next, and you could really see them shine on stage in this one.

- The last song of the night was their newest single [Bomb Bomb](https://youtu.be/uSVuVxyTiLQ). People had been waiting all night for them to perform this song, and it received a thunderous applause!

- They quickly left the stage afterward, and people were starting to leave, when all of a sudden the host told us to stay and request an encore from KARD by saying, We played our KARD right!, they came rushing back on stage and performed an [encore of Ride on the Wind](https://youtu.be/fRzyiNAE0x8). 

- After this encore, things went crazy and everybody rushed down their seats and gathered right in front of the stage and KARD performed an [encore of Bomb Bomb](https://youtu.be/H_CHF6y4hHs), this was by far my favourite moment of the night! The entire stadium was jumping up and down together and B.M kept on throwing water at us! All of us were soaked by the end, and it was out of control. The organisers warned us to stay safe, and thankfully nobody got hurt.  

- The final song of the night was the [encore of Living Good](https://youtu.be/Jzs7bNHuLKE). Everybody went crazy and Jiwoo took the fans phones and took a lot of pictures, she also came really close and shook the fans hands. This was the best moment of the night! I took a lot of [close up](https://imgur.com/a/I1bHrao) shots of them and it was surreal seeing them so near. All of them looked flawless.

- They concluded the concert saying that the Delhi concert was the best and they could really feel the crowds energy. They thanked us and promised to come back to India soon.

**Post Concert**

- I became a Hidden KARD after attending this concert and realising that KARD are amazing performers. Their energy on stage was unmatched, and their charisma was beyond anyone I have ever watched in concert live. They OWNED the stage. It was brilliant and I was so glad that I went after all.

- KARD posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0jp1jlSqV/?igshid=1qe2931w3ruh5) picture on their SNS after the concert ended, and B.M and Somin posted Instagram stories thanking the Delhi fans.

**TLDR:** The concert was excellent and KARD put upon a flawlessly performance with overflowing charisma and endless energy, Jiwoo has extremely stable vocals, and it was hard to tear eyes off B.M. Somin is good at everything, and J.Seph is a cute goofball. I highly recommend everyone to watch KARD in concert at least once in their lifetime!",5,35

2296,2019-7-17,2019,7,17,3,ce15we,Which idols/groups have shared stories of arguments or fights that they had with other members or groups,Sweet-Lullaby,1563302598,"This is simply to share stories that idols shared of fights or arguments that themselves shared cause I find it refreshing to see that side. 

Let me start with some stories.

Infinite are pretty open especially for idols:

&gt; During the broadcast, the group opened up about a time in the past when two of the members once got into a big argument, which ended up in a physical confrontation.

&gt;L opened up, The memories of the past are still fresh in my mind. I especially remember the time I fought with Sungyeol.

&gt;Sunggyu added on, I also remember it. The two of them came to me and asked What do we do about this? So I told them, What can you do, dive right into it.

&gt;Dongwoo also shared, I remember it too. The two of them tried to hide that they fought by lying and saying the clothes dryer fell. But it ended up being that they fought and injured their mouths.

Only Sunggyu would be bold enough to tell his members to dive right into it

[Infinite again: Sunggyu and Woohyun confess they nearly came to blows during a fight](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2013/04/sunggyu-and-woohyun-confess-they-nearly-came-to-blows-during-a-fight)

GOT7 has too many fight stories from JB/Jacksons Cold War over missing chicken wings to Mark/Youngjaes fight that led to a broken air con to JB/Jinyoung fighting over how lay on a mat to Mark throwing a laptop at Bambam.

Probably the funniest is when [poor Day6s Young K had to act as a translator ](https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/day6-young-k-translate-got7-fight/) for Mark during a fight when they were all JYPE trainees.  Mark was arguing with Pentagons Hui which led to BAPs Youngjae trying to step in to defuse them but then Youngjae and Mark started arguing. JB then joined to stop Mark and Youngjae arguing but then Mark started arguing with him too. 
Mark couldnt speak much Korean then so Brian was translating for him while he was arguing with multiple people while Jinyoung was in the corner with his popcorn. The whole image is just hilarious to imagine.

SNSD shared some of the arguments that they had over the years too.

&gt;Taeyeon said, During our Japanese tour concert, Ive been angry at Tiffany to the point of raising my voice.

&gt;Taeyeon continued, My emotions hurt a lot at the time. I almost cancelled the duet I had scheduled with Tiffany for the day after.

Finally [SHINees infamous fight between Key and Minho](https://www.soompi.com/article/383701wpp/key-and-minho-talks-about-their-big-fight-on-taxi) which started due a difference in dialects.

Keep it light if possible and dont judge the idols involved too harshly cause they are human after all and conflict is normal.  Share only stories that idols shared themselves and not rumours.",127,290

I almost spent 25$ on webtoon coins, because I was so infatuated with how good the art was, the complexity of the story that still tied to the actual plot the BTS albums have going on (unlike their other comic 'We On') and just the overall feel the whole comic had . As an EXO-L, I honestly think that EXO could make a Webtoon that ties directly with the group's/their album's plot, CONSIDERING that EXO have the comics and amazing art from 'The War: The Power of Music', as well as a strong plot, I think that if they  had a webtoon, it would be a force to be reckoned with (just like 'Save Me'). Even though this seems highly unlikely I just like to keep hoping that we will get a genuine webtoon, at least in the distant future . 


Also, with Monsta X being one of my top 5 groups, I was AMAZED when the We Bare Bears collab came out. The idea was fresh, and honestly I just loved everything about it. But still, with all of this you still have to count in how willing and able companies are to promote their groups and give them exposiure to western media/unique ideas and concepts abroad,,,,,,*choking SM in the background*

There is this KPOP song I used to listen to in my middle school years and it has been over 4 years since then. 

I vaguely remember scenes from the video. So here is the things I remember. 

First, I believe there is a clock and the time hits 5-7 and a slow piano music is followed. The notes on the piano is only one key at a time, something like tu... tu... tu... 

There are scenes from school and I believe the main singer of the boy band is in love with this girl from his school.

I am learning Korean and I want to join YG Entertainment next year to be a Kpop artist. I know it's a little late to be a trainee at my age. Being a singer or dancer was always my dream ever since I was a little kid but my parents didn't want me to be. They want me to study programming so that's why I am waiting until next year. I will be finally 18 years old. Question is do you think is it worth trying? I don't care about trainee period if it's gonna be good at the end. Also I know my chances are extremely slim because am a foreigner. I know it's even hard for Koreans and I am from an unusual country for Kpop. I look different than Korean or Japanese people. I still look feminine compared to westerners but I know I am different. So what do you think? Is life of a Kpop artist worth all those hardwork or I should just continue my studies which is one of the last things I want?,0,1

Anyone else got anything like that?  

**My journey to that genius conclusion**^(if you care)**:** I made my first kpop playlist in Mar. of 2018 starting with 3 songs I heard randomly in a youtube video and then using whatever spotify recommendations had at the bottom to add on to it. I had no idea who any of the artists/groups were, if I liked a song I just added it, and got up to about 40 songs. The first exo song that made it on was Ko Ko Bop, then later The Eve and then Monster, and I was like ok exo is a thing I guess. Then I got recommended Overdose but it said exo-k????? and some of the last additions to this playlist were a couple of exo-cbx???? songs, so at that point I was like wth are all these letters. I feel like I must have understood to some extent that these must be like different parts of the same group but I don't think I knew they overlapped at all, but I remember reading comments on some video (maybe an mv but I hardly watched anything at that time) and people were talking about exo-l and I just thought oh i guess they like that subunit of exo?. 

Getting into kpop was a really delayed response for me too. I actually kind of forgot about this playlist for a while and didn't decide to follow any groups until that december when i thought following bts could be low key, and now im absolute kpop trash. It's funny to remember my first impressions of everything.",96,72

They mention that this debt wont have a lot of effect on their overall finance budget.

&gt;One member is coached to cry, that's a fact. Notice how it happens almost every time a group gets their 1st win, there's always **one** member who cries. It's scripted that way. One member acts surprised, the others happy. There's a lot on the line so nothing is left to chances, they have PR people working hard to make sure everything goes perfectly.

Yet the big 3 are virtually nonexistent in Korea, as distribution is dominated by local corporations like CJ while talent is all contracted to local entertainment companies? Why is Korea in such a peculiar scenario in that they've virtually been untouched by the globalization forces that led to the big 3 dominating the rest of the world?

I assume the answer is a mix of government-enforced protectionism, competency of homegrown corporations, as well as perhaps a rapid rise in cultural exports that was perhaps underestimated for the global labels to view this as even a threat. However, I'd really love a more detailed answer from anyone who is well informed or can point to any business study cases, articles, or literature that could help shine more light on Korea's phenomenon.",3,7

I am learning Korean and I want to join YG Entertainment next year to be a Kpop artist. I know it's a little late to be a trainee at my age. Being a singer or dancer was always my dream ever since I was a little kid but my parents didn't want me to be. They want me to study programming so that's why I am waiting until next year. I will be finally 18 years old. Question is do you think is it worth trying? I don't care about trainee period if it's gonna be good at the end. Also I know my chances are extremely slim because am a foreigner. I know it's even hard for Koreans and I am from an unusual country for Kpop. I look different than Korean or Japanese people. I still look feminine compared to westerners but I know I am different. So what do you think? Is life of a Kpop artist worth all those hardwork or I should just continue my studies which is one of the last things I want?,5,0

Even people saying that K-pop has toxic fans (which is kinda true lmfaoooo), I guess now fandoms are also genuinely happy once their faves hit big and get famous and even want to spread the word lol

\# FAQ

&amp;#x200B;

\## How The Chart Works:

&amp;#x200B;

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

SeWoon is a pretty calm dude himself (according to him, his mom says he was a calm kid too). And truly on that episode, the fans were chill but not unenthusiastic. 


So I was wondering, what generalized statements can you make about fandoms of groups/soloists.

I have seen various American artists perform live, but nothing compares to what I saw last night at the twice concert. As they were performing the encore I felt so emotional about everything, I was just thinking ""Wow, these are just some girls who had some dreams from whatever town they are from and now the whole spotlight is on them, they are performing for almost 20k people in a foreign country and then they have basically a full country of fans supporting them back home."" It was truly crazy to me, I don't know why I felt this way vs American artists when in reality people like Beyonce or someone would have more of a ""struggle"" story, but maybe cause I watched the sixteen series so it put things into perspective I really don't know? Like everytime I saw their VCRs I thought the same thing, like wow. They are just a group of 9 girls who each had their own talents and quirks, they just dreamed big, worked hard and now they have millions of dollars spent on them through production and merch. Everything was extremely inspiring. After the concert I had insane withdrawls, I didn't want the night to end, I even have had the urge to become an idol myself (half jokingly since I know my race would never allow my entrance into the world of idol life)  just seeing the fruits of their hard work, it inspired me. 
Anyways, the concert was amazing. 2 hours of non stop excitement, which felt like only 20 minutes. I cheered, I sang my heart out. 
I am glad I got this experience even though I wasn't the biggest ONCE, I liked their music and knew the members and stuff but they weren't my ult gg or I don't watch every single variety but after seeing them live they definitely left an impact on me and are my new ults. Just witnessing the concert made me longing for more, and I can't wait or even imagine what it would be like to see BTS live in Korea or any other large stadium, something I surely would love to do before their enlistment. I now know the true passion that comes from the fans that buy the physical and digital albums and all the photocards and I look forward to doing the same (although my wallet hopes not). I can't wait till the next concert, and hopefully twice comes back to LA!!!
Share your experience that sort of made you dive even deeper into kpop, I always listened/ streamed and KPOP was my primary form of music, but now I feel that I am going to get even deeper, watch more variety and almost completely cut off american pop since really kpop is the music that gives me joy and excitement. All in all, my 1st kpop concert has to be one of my favorite memories of my life so far and it will truly be an unforgettable day!",13,70
2667,2019-7-19,2019,7,19,9,cf0j6v,Have you ever fallen into the charms of an idol solely through their variety show appearances?,Mozart-Luna-Echo,1563495723,"I was curious to see if other people have had my same experiences. Long before I discovered Sechkies music, I fell for Eun Ji Won oppas characters in his different variety show appearances. Especially NJTTW and Kangs Kitchen. Hes absolutely nuts but on stage theres just something about him thats completely oof. 

I discovered Monsta X through Shownu in Running Man. He seemed very quiet and shy and completely refreshing. This led me to become a Monbebe. 

My last discovery has been Choi Yena from Iz*one. She is just too adorable in Prison Life of Fools. I had not planned into diving into her groups discography but shes so cute that I cant help but look into it. She makes me feel like a big sister that needs to support her in everything she does.

To see and discuss the final group lineup, please make your way [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cf8wx8/producex101_final_group_lineup/)

To see the results of the 3rd elimination, please click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ccdqht/produce_x_101_third_elimination_rankings_episode/) to check out the thread.

So these are the official final rankings, which were determined in Episode 12.

Please ***note***, that the ""X"" slot, functionally replaces 11th place, but do to the nature of how the slot works, it ***does not*** mean they were 11th in the finale. I will be listing the ranks based on how the trainees ranked in the finale, minus the rank that the ""X Slot"" debuting member would have occupied.

Also, feel free to follow [this site](https://ajyu124.github.io/px101ranking/) for a more in-depth look of rankings week to week!

***NOTES:***

* If the ""X Slot"" did not exist, Lee Eunsang would have placed #14 in the finale, with Lee Jinhyuk (Wei) placing #11 and making the final group.
* Had Lee Eunsang kept his #14 rank, his changes from across the three eliminations would have been as follows:

|Change in Rank from the 3rd Elimination (Week 11)|Change in Rank from the 2nd Elimination (Week 8)|Change in Rank from the 1st Elimination (Week 5)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\-5|\-8|\-9|

* This is the first year that all three finale song centers (Mingyu, Yuvin, and Yunseong) did not make the debut lineup.
* This is the first time that a debuting member had a continual upward ranking trajectory, never dropping and never stalling in rank throughout the entire show (Cho Seungyeon).
* X1 has the record for having the most debuted idols (with officially active groups) in their lineup, with 4 (Kim Wooseok (Wooshin), Han Seungwoo, Cho Seungyeon, and Lee Hangyul)
* Starship holds the record for largest amount of trainees to debut in a Produce group across all four seasons with 5 (Yeonjung, Wonyoung, Yujin, Hyeongjun, and Minhee).
* This season marks the lowest rank for the program's initial center, with Dongpyo ranking #6. Yoojung (S1) and Daehwi (S2) ranked #3 and Sakura (PD48) ranked #2.
* Nam Dohyun is the youngest male trainee to make the debut lineup in the finale episode, being a 2004 liner (so 14 international age, 16 Korean age). He just misses tying the record of being the youngest trainee to debut, as Wonyoung (who is also a 2004 liner) was 15 Korean age during the finale of Produce 48.",41,131

TXT was so nervous before meeting them and so shy during. TXT basically prepared a Love Actually style (love?) letter to BTS, (starting around 13.30) and it was both cringy and adorable, but the awkwardness stood out to me. I've seen them meet up on camera several times before and TXT is always shy, formal and awkward around BTS. I realize a lot of it has to do with age and things like that, but it suprised me they're STILL so awkward (don't get me wrong, akward= also adorable) around each other. I'll be honest and admit that BTS got me into K-pop about a year and half ago and while I've gotten to know other groups and songs and have learned about the industry, I'm definitely not a K-pop expert. It made me wonder about other groups from the same company (like BTS and TXT) meeting (especially rookie groups vs established groups, but not limited to that) and their dynamic. Are there other/similar vids of same company groups meeting? I'm curious about the dynamics between groups/artists from the same company. Is it even a thing outside of BigHit, since TXT and BTS are the only two groups? Are groups/artists from the same company usually friends? I would love to hear how they usually behave around each other. Is there a difference between boygroups and girlgroups and things like that? Videos and anecdotes are both welcome. It's probably a stupid and weird question to most kpop fans, but the TXT/BTS awkwardness made me wonder and I'm hoping some of us here are also wondering. Thanks in advance!",85,130

On the side note Im happy to see how strong of a unit they are and that Winwin seems so much happier with WayV. WayV members seem to really care for each other and it warms my heart :) 

Other speculations: is Ten getting quieter to you guys? I hope being in yet ANOTHER foreign environment isnt making him too uncomfortable.

Everything now has a more unique style and is seen as more ""pro"" and global. But I actually enjoy the rhythm of the 90s eurodance, I think the older kpop idols are a bit underrated nowadays.

Which papago translates to :
It's not only inappropriate to include a plot or scene that sexually targets female dancers, including Yot-scene in the music video, but it also doesn't fit the message that Ah-Tist was trying to deliver in the song. SM, the artist's agency, strongly demands that the problem be quickly identified and that the music video be deleted and corrected.

What are the top 3 best companies for girl groups? What about what are the top 3 *worst* companies for girl groups? Why is that?

Im mainly focusing on girl groups because except for a few boy groups here and there, Ive noticed that companies dont really destroy their boy groups at a breakneck speed compared to their girl groups. (Please do not confuse these questions with successful vs nugu.)

Just thought Id ask because besides JYPE (at least since 2015) and Oh My Girls company WM, I cant really think of any!",15,6

Countless BTS achievements get deleted, despite them being history-making, while posts inciting negativity towards BTS/ARMY are kept up and justified by the mods. The Tamar mess was just one of the latest examples, with them justifying that mess of a post still being up and one of the mods taking to twitter and defending a known BTS defamator, which is disheartening.

I remember 3 years ago I was sitting in the Incheon Airport waiting for a flight to India when I saw the rerun (?) or live I am not sure I wasn't into kpop back then of this stage play. Ever since then that just stuck with me as ""kpop"" and now as a Seventeen fan when I go back and watch that stage or their [debut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbFwD-Yy5Lw) stage it just gives me nostalgia of MY og definition of kpop lol. Even everytime I see twice's ""like ooh ah"" debut [stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYkGpOeqp4g) it gives me these same kinds of vibes.

Nowadays kpop's concepts have definitely changed drastically and I definitely enjoy them it's just cool to look back. The schoolboy concept that 17 gave off back in the day is really what created my personal kpop definition. Then the stage setup and decorations in twice's stage further contributed to that definition.

Seventeen Vernon

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. This is the third installment and I'm going to continue my format from last week with an in-depth on one group.  [Here's a link to last-week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cd5yg8/nugu_roundup_2_nature_is_frickin_lit_190714/).

&amp;#x200B;

I intended to do more mini-spotlights this week and to get this out yesterday (Sunday) but was sick as a dog all day and could barely drag myself out of bed, so this week's roundup is a bit abbreviated and a bit late, my apologies on that.

&amp;#x200B;

With GWSN and Pink Fantasy both having big comebacks in the next couple of weeks, I decided to focus this week's special feature on a group I just discovered last week with their most recent comeback, but who've been around working it since 2012.  Let's get to know FlaShe.

&amp;#x200B;

**And now on to the show...**

&amp;#x200B;

**FlaShe**

**Who are they?:**  A (currently) 4 member girl group under Play Music Entertainment (a subsidiary of FLASHE Entertainment, hard to find out much about them, they don't seem to have a big presence on the English-speaking Internet).  Originally debuted in 2012.

**Genre:** Various throughout the years, including cute, girl crush, hip-hop, and sexy concepts.

**Members:**  The current lineup consists of:

* Narae:  Leader, lead vocal, main dancer, main rapper.  Narae is the only member left from the original debut line.  29 years old (IA). Real name Kang Na-Rae.  [Pops in Seoul Profile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_MYEwjfSjk). [Narae's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfCaiRYWMYnO9TQNPcwOtiA/feed).
* Seryeong: Main Vocalist.  Seryeong joined the group in 2018, and was previously a member of Vetty L.  26 years old (IA).  Real name Lim Seryeong.  [Seryeong's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flashe_seryeong/).
* Yerin: Vocalist.  Joined the group in 2017.  Age unknown, real name unknown.  [Yerin's instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flashe_yerin/).
* Sujin: Lead Vocal, Lead Dancer, Maknae.  The newest member of the group, joining October 2018 after the departure of Minseo following a back injury.  22 years old (IA).  [Sujin's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flashe_sujin/).

**Debut:**  FlaShe debuted on July 4th 2012 with the single [Drop It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBjwWGrvQto) from their debut extended single release [Drop It Pop It](https://www.genie.co.kr/detail/albumInfo?axnm=80299837).

**Most recent comeback:** [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHg_8m8bAK8), released July 15th on their [Talk Extended Single](http://mw.genie.co.kr/detail/albumInfo?axnm=81242931#).  Here's [Talk's first live stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgo7fDDrSZ0).

**Other MVs:**  FlaShe have a wide range of styles in their MVs and live performances.

* After debuting with a EDM-heavy track their second MV [Oh Ye Yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwnuufLr94) is much more in the 'cute crush' wheelhouse.
* They followed that with a digital single (no MV) called [The Flowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqqgO27TBWg), which is the kind of acoustic yearning ballad I personally can't get enough of.
* Next came a shift to a complete cute concept with [Hey You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rccaa7Wg50).
* [My Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXsp5cPU3c), their next MV, shows an evolution to a more mature cute concept, and shows the girls on a London trip where it looks like they had a blast.
* Another evolution of their cute concept came with [Star of Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTab10kVBI), which showed them going in an almost GFriend-lite direction.
* 2016 saw them shifting to a much harder hitting sexy concept with [Lip Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTt8hRnns).
* Later in 2016 another digital single without an MV called Ippn Girl (Cutie Girl) saw a return to a more innocent Girl/Cute Crush concept.  ([live performance link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDBssqQO8F8)).
* In 2017 their release [Popping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HQE7cDdhZc) continued in the Cute Crush concept.
* Their final release before their latest comeback came in 2018 with [Baby Lotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkNik8qcdE), solidly back in the Girl Crush concept, and the members mentioned they were going for a Sistar vibe.

**Variety:** FlaShe (old lineup) on [Secret Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo06ArWAjSM)

**Vlogs:** They have two official YouTube channels: [FLASHE](https://www.youtube.com/user/flashe05), and [FlaShe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQ-WONWeyK1sNAfxVryb-g/videos).

**Trivia:**  The group presents a bit of a 'ship of Theseus' conundrum as they've had a total of 14 different members throughout the years yet only one remains from the original lineup.  Over the years they've wanted to present themselves as 'Healing-Dols', summer queens, sexy, hip-hop, and cute.  They've performed extensively internationally, including China, Japan, the USA, the UK, Russia, and Cambodia.

 18 July 2019
Through Kuanlin's lawyer, he notified Cube about the termination of the exclusive contract

Note :
Kuanlin has been trying to resolve the conflict with Cube as much as possible before disclosing them first

But Cube rejected n disagreed that Cube has violating the contract

Kuanlin didn't have his own seal at the time of his contract so he replaced it w/ autograph. But he was informed that he has seal at Cube. He didn't have stamp so s.o has made KL seal w/o his consent",27,43

I'll go first, but I probably can't explain myself that well. Bar none, my favorite would have to be Body Talk by Red Velvet.

The track itself has an 80's synth beat that reminds me of a song that I can't quite put my finger on, so it has a sort of calming familiarity. BTW, if you know what 80's song it sounds like please let me know. It's been bugging me forever.

As for the lyrics, if I'm reading them correctly, it's a love song that's more than a love song. It's not just ""Hi boy/girl. I like you. Do you like me? Please notice me."" Instead, it touches on a part of love that we don't like to talk about. It's about the end of the relationship, where you're so in love that you can read your partner's every move, and you can tell that their heart's just not in it anymore without them saying a word, and now you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's not so much a crying your eyes out sad as it is a numbing realization kind of sad, but still makes you wanna cry a little. As far as I'm aware, the negative aspects of love and relationships aren't covered all that often in K-pop, so I guess that's what makes it stand out to me.",189,140

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

This is NOT to talk about whos music is better, who has better concepts or style but just casual chatting about what could help boy groups that are stuck in the 30s and free fall ONLY on Melon or groups that have big fanbases that work really but it never touches the charts.

**This is excluding boy groups that are digital monsters or with OVERWHELMING fandom power. EX. Fandom Power; BTS, EXO and Digital Monster Groups like Winner, Wanna One, Big Bang ect. No album sales talk either this is purely Digital Charting.**

Ive been a kpop fan since 2016 and have been through the two major chart changes that started in 2017 starting first with the ban on international fan use of Melon and then the nightly chart freeze to combat fans helping their groups get to the top during night hours. Both of which were made to kill off fandom power of pushing groups to the top of the charts.

Ive noticed over time mid tier girl groups significantly rise over mid tier to high tier boy groups? Oh My Girl, Lovelyz, WJSN can chart for days if not weeks in the 30s-50s. I know GG are definitely more GP friendly and have easier growth over time too!

When it comes to groups like Seventeen (they do decent), NCT, Monsta X, GOT7, iKon (pre-Love Scenario/pre-BI scandal), NUEST, Astro, Pentagon, VIXX, The Boyz ect and even when you think the public would give newer groups a chance like Stray Kids, A.C.E, Ateez, AB6IX, CIX ect They just dont? All of these groups chart either in the OK! to Not at All range? Even with groups that have massive fandom power inside and outside of SK, Im talking buying 300+ Melon passes for international fans, solid to massive SK fandom and chart at #1 on every other chart often for days if not over a week. 

I would love to know everyones thoughts on why these boy groups don't chart higher? Is it because their men/boys and females are just more friendly? Yes of course I know some of these groups music or concepts isnt for everyone or they arent GP obviously. But it seems like that kind of fandom power should equal to something? It seems sketchy that groups that hit #1 across all charts BUT Melon tend to mean nothing to the GP and or get no recognition for their charting otherwise. 

Does it just take one hit song to do it like iKon? Is it something that will change when we lose groups like BTS/EXO/WINNER to the Military in the next 1-2 years? Should these groups just not worry about it and not care about charting because its not everything (even if they get dragged for it)?

Charts are weird man, I just would love to hear kind opinions from others!",45,8

GWSN have a very strong group identity. Its clear to me that whoever runs the project knows exactly what the group is and what it should strive to be. I feel like internationally GWSN are very underrated. Their recent comeback titled ""Red Sun"" showcases a clear understanding of the niche that this group occupies. Now, I am not big on music genres, but GWSN to me feels very ""progressive pop"" if that makes sense. And that s a pretty fresh sound for a girl group. Also wanted to mention that their rap line is amazing, The voices showcase a strong presence, which when supplied by a beat drop creates a very satisfying sound. Also, their B-sides, at least to me feel like they have that familiar sense of sincerity that for example Twice songs have imo.  
All in all, I just listened to their b-sides and felt so inspired to come here and praise them. Cuz they really deserve more attention. But I know that they are not meant for mainstream and community stans will check em out, so yeah.  
Go stream Red Sun!!

Redditors have chosen these female idols to be in the first ever group voted by /r/kpop.

To recap, they are: Sakura (IZ*ONE), Yuri (IZ*ONE), Chaeyeon (IZ*ONE), Yena (IZ*ONE), Eunbi (IZ*ONE), Soyeon(G-IDLE), Hayoung (Fromis_9), Gyuri (Fromis_9), Seoyeon (Fromis_9), Jiwon (Fromis_9) and Olivia Hye (LOONA)

This season, 101 male idols will be competing for your votes. The same format will be used just like last season. We have even more groups this time as I have not included every member for each group but just about half of the members. These groups have debuted from 2017 to Feb 2019. With comments that IZ*ONE had a lot of votes and significantly more popular, I decided not to include Wanna One in this season. There are still some which might be popular than the rest but hoping this will at least expose  you to some of the groups that you might have not heard of.

Here are the groups included in this season:

1) [14U](https://kprofiles.com/14u-members-profile/)

2) [A.C.E.](https://kprofiles.com/ace-kpop-boy-group-members-profile/)

3) [Ateez](https://kprofiles.com/kq-fellaz-members-profile/)

Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpyrBqypIMOrtnmeS4wBYFGF7iNhXvXMQIEakYy_aKrCmS2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to the form. You are allowed to vote up to 7 times. For this season, I will allow you to vote up to 7 times on the same form instead of submitting it 7 times. Only the first time is required, the rest is not for those who don't want to vote 7 times. You are to choose 11 idols each time, and it can be different for all times. Just don't answer the rest if you don't want to vote all 7 times.

For next week, we will be doing the group ""evaluation"". Based on the response this week, I might tweak the amount of benefit votes since some people think last season has a high amount of benefit votes for the winner. Do help to upvote this thread so that more people will see it. Feel free to campaign and link to your favourite groups as well. Remember, this is done in the spirit of fun so try not to be too spiteful or even voting in multiple accounts. 

If you miss any of the weekly post, just search for ""KPOPRODUCE"" so you don't miss out on voting. I will also ask the mods to link on ""The Stickies"" thread. The voting will end on 1/8/19, 530PM KST.

P.S. I am rebooting this since the last time I did this, it coincided with the Burning Molka incident and it kinda got buried. Hopefully, we will get to have much better participation this time round.",11,21

Btw, you can look at my comment history to get the gist of it if you can't find my comment since the original one has been downvoted. 

\--------

I leave a comment about how I'm a fan of Big Bang, and how everything that has happened is really disappointing, and so forth. I'll admit it beforehand, and I admitted it on that thread, my wording was a bit off afterwards. I wrote ""As a straight male, I'm not a fan of pretty boy groups."" Yes, that wasn't the best way to put it, but all of a sudden, I get paragraphs of how I'm misogynistic, a homophobe, and that I am emasculating my own Korean brothers. It went from me having a preference (because in my PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, a lot of the pretty boy groups tend to have a style of music I do not like), to me being a straight male that doesn't listen to gay artists because I simply mentioned I am straight. 

In the heat of the moment, the replies I have left may have been emotionally driven, and I could've toned it down myself, I admit and apologize. However, the main reason of this post is, for a sub that is so proud to be open-minded, and praising idols for speaking their minds, apparently any opinion that is against your own is meant to be barraged with accusations and downvotes. 

I can't believe that my original comment led people to say that I am anti-gay, considering my own older brother is happily married to the best brother-in-law I can ask for. 

Ironically enough, those same comments have been removed by the mods. I appreciate the fact that while some of you may not have the decency to have a civil conversation without throwing mindless accusations first, the mods understand the rules clearly, and what is appropriate and what isn't. 

This is one of my favorite subs, if not my favorite, since I've been following K-pop as a Korean-American male since 2007. It's a shame that I even have to write a post like this, even if mods remove it and no one sees it, I still wanted to write this to vent. 

Now that I have written this, I realize there isn't a question I want to discuss, but I am open to whatever you all have to say.",2,0

Fans to obsessive,sli9989,1564091450,In the K-pop industry everyone has become so obsessive over artist like G-Dragon Bigbang BTS all of the big-name heavy-hitters but in all reality most of their music is ripped off from mainstream American music and they don't say anything about that and then you have these fans who are just giving a product every K-pop person is a product that their company puts out that is just to get women to buy their things but in all reality these people are people nobody realizes that you have like G-Dragon who bought a house to be super private and to have his life separate from the entertainment industry and you had fans who snuck in and we're ringing his doorbell but nobody humanizes these people you think of them as Gods you think of them is higher than anything else let them be human humans make mistakes humans have problems humans have breaking points but you guys don't allow them to be human you don't allow them to love you don't allow them to make the mistakes you don't allow them to go out and live life and not have to be hounded by 100000 people it's sad that you you as fans have just destroyed people I mean look at it for example you have big bang they are falling apart top came out of military service and he's been height in hiding and just focusing on artwork and why because you guys are being so cool so miss judging on everything that they do wrong because of one person and their mistakes but what about the pressures that you guys place on them as fans you place on them so much that they aren't even allowed to love or if they get their heart broken you attacked their exes or for example of DJ Russian Justin he got divorced and they were completely happy and fan started attacking his ex-wife you as fans should take an inner look of yourself support them and their music and be happy but let them be human #theyarehumantoo,0,1

[This initiative is ](https://musically.com/2019/06/21/music-industry-comes-together-to-tackle-stream-manipulation/)[pretty much](https://musically.com/2019/06/21/music-industry-comes-together-to-tackle-stream-manipulation/) [backed by the entire music industry from global majors to the independent sector around the world.](https://musically.com/2019/06/21/music-industry-comes-together-to-tackle-stream-manipulation/) They even created a ""[Code of Conduct](https://www.scribd.com/document/413966254/Anti-Stream-Manipulation-Code-of-Best-Practice)"", which although isn't a legally enforceable document, shows the direction and thought process of how they currently define it. 

The Code of Conduct of course includes the clearly illegal ""bot farms and pay4play services"" but widen that spectrum to (specifically #3) ""genuine"" listening.

&gt;3. Stream manipulation involves the artificial creation, by human or non-human means, of online or offline plays on audio or audio-visual streaming services i.e. where those plays do not represent genuine listening. Stream manipulation may be undertaken in respect of individual or groups of recordings in order to artificially improve chart positioning, increase market share, increase royalty payments, or for other dishonest purposes.

In Kpop, fanbases are much more organized then most major music markets are accustomed to, and not-to discredit any kpop group, definitely has some ""organized listening"". There are things like ""zombie streaming"" using multiple devices, multiple accounts, and concerted efforts to listen/watch for the sake of numbers rather than what has been called ""genuine"" ""organic"" listening. 

Even if its not feasibly enforceable, where do you draw the line between what is and isn't streaming manipulation?",31,16

3769,2019-7-26,2019,7,26,23,ci3tit,How K-nets discovered Produce X 101 and Produce 48 Vote Rigging Patterns and the explanation of what they are,magekinnarus,1564152676,"As Produce X 101 vote rigging controversy intensifies with the pending lawsuits and Mnet's announcement of requesting a police investigation on its own production team, here is the full explanation of the evidences that has led to this chain of event.

[Source:  https:\/\/gall.dcinside.com\/board\/view\/?id=producex&amp;no=3037096](https://i.redd.it/6hjuxzxm8nc31.jpg)

It started with the above table's third column, the number of vote difference between each vote count with the one just above in ranking. Some K-nets noticed unusually high repeating patterns in numbers. This led to some K-nets to look more closely into the numbers and soon discovered many irregularities. This finally led to the discovery of every contestant's final vote count is a multiple of 7494.442.

In a voting as large as Produce X 101, each contestant's final vote count should be mathematically independent from one another. So, having all 20 vote count results to have a common denominator of 7494.442 is so improbable to the point of impossibility. (an exception of Koo Jungmo's vote number of 704,748 is possibly a clerical error from writing down 704,478.)

With this discovery, many K-nets became mobilized setting up an emergency committee to demand an explanation from M-net as well as seeking legal advice. M-net, initially silent on the demands of K-nets, offered an explanation after receiving some attention from Korea's media on the issue. However, the initial explanation of voting round error by Mnet only further fueled the controversy to the point of a Korean parliamentary politician to call out Mnet on the issue.

As it turned out, the number 7494.442 was the average individual final vote count divided by 100. In other words, 7494.442 X 2,000 equaled the total number of votes. This implied that Mnet first converted every individual contestant's vote count into a vote percentage ratio, and converted them once again from 100 base points to 2,000 base points, and then multiplied them by 7494.442.

This whole process makes no sense because each step not only is unnecessary but also complicates the calculation since simple calculations of vote numbers, even with the weighted ones, should be more than sufficient to get the job done. This leads to the conclusion that the procedure has a different purpose, namely extracting a large number like 2,000 that can quickly match to the final total vote counts by multiplying a constant, no matter how 2,000 points are distributed across.

This is the only logical and plausible explanation, and it also explains the second step of the process, converting from 100 point base to 2,000 point base. Distributing 100 points among 20 contestants are limiting whereas distributing 2,000 points makes much easier to fine-tune the distribution. Only natural conclusion from this is that the purpose of 2,000 points is for the distribution and the fine-tuning of the votes. In other words, vote manipulation.

Once the potential vote manipulation methods by Mnet were established, some of K-nets also looked into the vote results of Produce 48. And sure enough, they discovered exactly same pattern emerging. The below is what they discovered:

[Translation of the source: https:\/\/gall.dcinside.com\/board\/view\/?id=producex&amp;no=3037096](https://i.redd.it/mfkyngposnc31.jpg)

The exactly the same patterns were revealed with the only difference coming from using 10,000 point base instead of 2,000 base points. And there is no transcribing error, unlike in the case of Koo Jungmo, as every final vote count being a multiple of 445.2178.

This reveals the fact that the vote manipulation, if proven, isn't an isolated incident of Produce X 101 but an indication of possibly much more prevalent and serious issues within Mnet organization.",317,968

What are some of your favorite guilty pleasures involving K-Pop? 

For those who are unaware or unfamiliar; guilty pleasure is something that you know in your mind isn't particularly amazing or anything, and most people would probably laugh at, but you love it all the same. I think this can kind of be attributed to K-Pop in general due to the public mass interest in it, but that aside, what things within the community/business do you find pleasure in?  


Personally, I have two:  
1. I love reading twitter fanwars. It's like watching a bunch of idiots try to put out of a dumpster fire with wood. Nothing ever gets solved and the situation is only made worse *but I can't look away.*   
2. Reaction videos. I wish I could explain myself but I can't.",194,296

Modern East Asian culture leans significantly more to the feminine side for both male and females in general, and it's evident in both the fashion as well as how people speak and carry themselves. Culturally, East Asian culture is more conservative and the roles of men and women are more traditional.

 In the west, society standard leans more masculine overall, and females once past a certain young age are expected to not to dress or act cute, or be overtly feminine or have ""old fashioned"" preferences when it comes to how men and women relate to each other (it's often looked down upon as being regressive and not up to modern feminism standards). Males are expected to be tough and manly and stoic, and dress/act accordingly. Even the metrosexual trend will only go so far before it hits a wall of masculine expectations.

Has been a K-pop fan influenced your own sense of identity in any way in terms of your fashion sense and how you behave, or your romantic/relationship ideals ? Has it caused problems in your personal life?",90,153

I found out that many girls find that kpop artists are more attractive than a handsome muscular man.

He seems serious, dark short hair, and does darker music than with his original group (I think). It's not G-Dragon or any other too famous artist. I remember maybe that in one of his videos there was a chair and tv glitches in a big screen, also a tree without leaves maybe. The sound could be between rap/trap but def something darker.

But it seems like on the CLC profile, Eunbin is the face of the group.

Since I'm a new fan, I was curious if there was a time where Eunbin was the most popular member? I was surprised to see her position, because lately it seems like everyone has been hyping up Yeeun and Seungyoon etc.

3862,2019-7-27,2019,7,27,21,cih276,Minx Pop: A girl group genre lost to time,NudePenguin69,1564231422,"Now let me start by saying that I am WELL aware there were lots of girl groups that did this style of music, I just made the title to be a little tongue and cheek and because I am going to be using Minx as an example.  


I was watching [Minx's Why Did You Come To My Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqiEAod0LYI) MV today and it really got me thinking.  For anyone not aware, Minx was originally made up of 5 of the members of Dreamcatcher before they re-branded and added 2 members.  Minx only ever put out one original title track and then covered a Dal Shabet B-side for their only comeback.

Now this is whats interesting to me about Why Did You Come To My Home and what I found very strange about it in relation to today's modern girl group landscape.  The song and MV have no real boundaries.  In that I mean that the song itself is very poppy and catchy, the video is bright and happy, but its also mature and sexy.  They dont play the happy, poppy vibe off for cuteness and they dont play the mature, sexy dancing and vocals off for being hard and badass.  Its just in the middle.

Why this is interesting to me is I cant think of girl group today that does this. Almost all girl group songs lately really kind of fit into a box.  Groups can have different concepts from song to song, but the song itself is almost always just solidly one style.  The only exceptions to this are Teen Crush groups like Weki Meki or Itzy who have both poppy and girl crush styles in their songs, but even then, the two are rarely mixed, they are separated into different parts of the song, which tends to be why a lot of people characterize them as ""Disconnected"" or some such.  

For the most part, every group has songs that say defenitively either ""We are that young teenybopper group that you love to find adorable"" or ""Look how mature and badass we are"".  We kind lost that in between of ""We are a bunch of girls in our early 20s just having fun being girls in our early 20s"" feel.  

Do you agree with this?  Is there anyone I am maybe overlooking?  Why do you think this happened?  Do you think globalization of Kpop caused groups to be formed with the intention of being ""like"" a popular group in order to gain fans?  (IE ""You like Blackpink?  Oh you will love G-idle!)",30,118

Id like to start off by saying that TWICE is my GOAT group. I was tuning out of K-Pop when my original GOAT group lost one of their members (SNSD and Sica). 

As I felt like my last ties to K-Pop were disappearing, all of a sudden JYPs new girl group was hit with a controversy: one of their members, Tzuyu, was involved in a flag scandal. I looked up the group out of curiosity and I said Id support them until the controversy died down. 

CHEW-YOU (how I originally pronounced her name before Chewy) became my favorite member because thats who the controversy was about and I wanted to support her throughout. 

From that moment on, it all went downhill in a good way (depending on how you look at it  monetarily maybe not so much LOL). 

TT was what kept my interest in them, but KNOCK KNOCK solidified my love for the group and Ive been 100% hooked to them ever since.

Thats the back story of why I love TWICE! 

Anyways, since I went to three shows there were more things that were the same than different, so Ill talk about the concert as a whole in the Chicago section. In the LA and Newark section, Ill just list things that made them unique.

Disclaimer: This is all my opinion of course. Also, Im doing most of this from memory, so if youve went to one of these shows and I missed out on something, feel free to add it on in the comments!

###Los Angeles  07/17/19###

####Personal / Trip Thoughts 

Im in LA often enough, so it wasnt anything new to me. The walk from the Rodeway Inn &amp; Suites in Inglewood, CA to The Forum isnt the most glamorous. The area around it isnt either. So, if youre thinking about walking to The Forum from there, I suggest doing so with some friends. I got lucky on the way back and met two guys who were walking the same way I was.

####Concert

I was sat in Section 230, Row 8, Seat 14. 

[Pictures from my time in Los Angeles + concert pictures]( https://imgur.com/a/acaZmfE)

####Special interactions for LA

* The venue was so loud the entire time. Its not that the other two werent, its that there was almost no off switch for LA. Even during the VCRs people were going wild. It couldve been one quick clip of someones bias and the whole stadium erupted. In comparison to the other two venues, that hype fizzled out halfway through the VCR.  

* The games (via the VCR) were the best here! That first guy who was caught on camera to do the dances had me in stitches. Dude had no clue what he was doing, but he did his best and thats all that matters LOL.

* Jeongyeon cried after talking about Mina during the end of the concert

* I was totally disappointed they didnt play Signal and Knock Knock. I expected those songs to be somewhere in the middle. When it got near the end, I was thinking, Theres no way they left those two as the encore. And they did! The guy next to me said, I TOLD YOU SO! when the encores started. 

###Newark (Silver VIP)  07/21/19###

####Personal / Trip Thoughts

Whew, no offense Newark denizens, but I did not have the greatest time in your city. It was the worst experience Ive had with panhandling in my life. 

I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Newark Downtown. Every time I walked out of the hotel there was a panhandler nearby. I found out that I shouldve just walked along the Prudential Center side rather than the side west to the Prudential Center.  

The first day I got there, I walked around the area to get some food. I was hit up by four panhandlers in a five minute walk! Eventually I got to this place called the Noodle Bar. The only person working in there left me by myself. I felt obligated to stay in the restaurant because I didnt want anyone to steal anything. I hopped on my Instagram and asked my friends (jokingly) what I should do LOL. 

On the way back, I went into a 7-11 to get some drinks. The cashier on the phone was talking to someone about how earlier on in the day, someone tried to rob them. Her words, not mine, What? You really gonna rob me for $50? I said no. Brave lady to say the least.

####Concert

The seat assigned to me was Section A, Row 26, Seat 3 but I stood up and was able to be at the barricade the whole time!

[Pictures from my time in Newark + concert pictures](https://imgur.com/a/PF9vLdl)

VIP check-in wasnt all that bad minus the sweating from humidity. It was fairly straightforward and simple. You got in, went through security, showed your ID to prove that it was you who bought and are picking up the tickets, then we took the escalator up to merch. Since I knew I was getting the pre-show merch here in Newark, I didnt fret about merch in LA. 

####Special Newark Interactions:

* I didnt realize how much I loved this group until I saw them up close. 

* Chaeyoung was INCHES away from me. I could feel her sassiness ooze into my body.

* Momo  my Dancing Queen  was just impossible to comprehend up close and personal. The way her body moved to each song was just astounding. It was like seeing a Formula 1 driver drive thru the same corner at the same speed every time. How do they do it? How are they that good? Thats the level she was at. On top of that, she was drop dead gorgeous. I was taken aback every time she waved our way.

* Sana was about to sing a line that she thought was hers in After Moon. Once she realized it wasnt her turn, she shyly looked to the ground and started laughing at herself.

* Jihyo cried after they sang After Moon .

* While Jihyo was wiping away tears, Jeongyeon joked, My color is so similar to Minas that I thought you guys were cheering for me for a second. Her joke definitely lightened the mood! 

####Silver VIP Interaction:

* After they finished Stuck, I could feel my heart knocking in my throat and my stomach. I knew that it was almost time to meet the girls. My friends and I walked up to Section 13 and into the line of eagerly awaiting ONCEs. 

* It was SUPER strict. If youre wondering, How on earth does someone not have footage of VIP? its because there was security on deck. Security also did three sweeps to make sure your phones were put away. You also signed a waiver beforehand that essentially stated you wouldnt release video/audio from the interaction.

* There was about ten-fifteen security guards for the lines itself. There were three security guards at the entrance of the curtains. I believe there were five/six security guards lined up behind you (so while you were facing Twice the guards wouldve been two feet away facing your back). And then there were three guards at the exit of the curtains.

* Nayeon was so sweet. She said, Hi!!!!! How are you!!!!! to everyone that came by. Chaes hands are so small. I couldnt look Momo in the eye because I was too shy shy shy. I told Sana  because Im a loser and all those years of living in Japan led me to this moment. She smiled back and nodded so Ive got that going for me. I dabbed at Dubu but she didnt dab back probably cause I didnt do it in time lol. Jeongyeon looked like she needed a nap. Jihyo was super smiley. AND THEN THERE WAS OUR MAKNAE. So shy and only saying Hi! to everyone. 

Initially I had thought the Silver VIP wouldnt have been worth it because its just a hitouch, but if I could do it all again, I wouldve jumped on the Gold/Silver VIP at all the stops. 

Overall, Newark was INCREDIBLE because of the people I got to meet. I didnt get to find out if they were Redditors or not, but if you are and you are reading this, it was my pleasure to meet you. I really hope we cross paths again. I know some of us are meeting up at KCONLA, but Id love to see those of you who arent going to KCONLA again someday .  

###Chicago  07/23/19###

####Personal / Trip Thoughts 

Just like Newark, this was my first time in this city. Nightmare trying to get a Lyft/Uber out of OHare. I was flabbergasted when my Uber started to approach your city. The skyline was BEAUTIFUL. I mean Ive been to so many cities and this one took me aback.  

I spent $40 on a pizza and wings. I needed to try out the famed deep-dish Chicago pizza. Jeongyeon herself vouched for your pizza. Ill have to say it was the best deep-dish pizza Ive ever had.  

I went and did tourist-y things with a friend of mine. While at The Bean, a guy came up to us and started asking some questions. Eventually he changed his tone of voice and said, The next person who refuses me $40 is going to be dropped. 

So, even in broad daylight with hundreds of people around you, be careful and keep your guard up. Luckily I was able to shoo away my friend from the situation before I bolted from the guy. 

Also, I stayed at the Marquis Marriott right next to the Wintrust. Beautiful hotel with amazing staff. I highly recommend staying here if you plan to do a concert at the Wintrust any time. It is a bit pricy if youre budget conscious, so Id recommend rooming with friends if you wanna stay nearby.  

The first night in Chicago, I just walked around and took some pictures with my DSLR. I was stunned at how beautiful Chicagos weather was. If I sat outside in Arizona at 7pm, I would melt into the ground. The weather right now in Chicago (in the evening) is the type of weather we get in Arizona in NOVEMBER. 

####Concert

I was sat at Sec 102, Row N, Seat 5. 

[Pictures from my time in Chicago + concert pictures]( https://imgur.com/a/pE2uwMf)

This was the best venue no doubt about it. 

The walkway to the center stage and the entrance stage was shortened so everyone had a perfect view of them no matter where they were at on either stage. 

The concert opened with a VCR of JYP as an organization. It featured all of their acts such as JYP himself and Miss A.

Every group got loud cheers. I think the loudest (not including Twice) at every venue was GOT7. As soon as their song popped up, it was as if all the girls in the venue tried breaking the sound barrier. 

The one that surprised me the most was ITZY. I really like ITZY, but figured since they were so new and fresh that they havent really found their following yet. However, at each venue, the audience went wild when they came up. When the chorus started to play, everyone was yelling DALLA. DALLA. DALLLLLLA.

After this VCR played, there was a brief moment of silence before the next VCR kicked up. The girls appeared one by one and were being absorbed by a thingy-majig. Then they all appear together and pose for the camera.

The screen cuts to black and the stage starts to fill with smoke. The girls on stage left and stage right appeared in a trio whereas the girls in the middle were a duo. 
Concert opener was STUCK IN MY HEAD. Honestly, Im not a big fan of the song because I play Superstar JYP and for some odd reason, I drop notes in that song when I know I hit the notes correctly. Hearing it live gave me PTSD, but in actuality I was jamming out pretty hard to it.

I was lucky to see CHEER UP at KCON last year, so I wasnt too surprised by it. Touchdown had the crowd cheering every single step of the way. 

After a short break where they introduced themselves and talked to the crowd, they jumped straight into performing BDZ. YES or YES was a song I needed to see live. I didnt realize how much heart and soul went into that song until I saw it live. 

This isnt an @ at anyone since Im one of those people who love K-Pop but doesnt fully understand Korean, but I was really surprised that the ONE English song on their setlist was a song EACH VENUE did not sing along to. I Want You Back is iconic and I belted that out at every single stop. 

From I Want You Back, the soundtrack transitioned into a new song with a war drum-like beat. The song was eventually revealed to be Dance the Night Away. This was also a song I was able to see at KCON last year, so I wasnt too hyped for it, but still enjoyed it nonetheless.

Im not sure if Im getting the timing on this right, but I believe the VCR with them in the white room and white dresses happened during this intermission. This was one of my favorite VCRs because it was shot very well. Each girl got ample time in the edits and the crowd went wild whenever Mina popped up.

Finally, the girls came out in their white dresses and sang AFTER MOON. As I mentioned before, EACH VENUE lit up the venue with Mint/Teal for Mina and the chants for her were through the roof. 

After You In My Heart, they played SUNSET while walking around the stage and waving to their fans. Fan service queen Dubu was on fire. She was throwing out heart fingers, blowing kisses, doing hearts with people in the crowd, and waving at everyone. (Authors Note: SUNSET is now one of my favorite B-Side songs. Id take a listen to it if you havent already!)

They walked from center stage to the main stage to start singing a slower version of Heart Shaker. Before they could finish the song, they were lowered beneath the stage and it cut to another VCR.

This VCR introduced them in red outfits. I dont really remember too much about this VCR since I liked the white outfit VCR a lot more than this one tbh.

After the VCR finished, the girls came out and finished the song in their red outfits (one of my favorites of the night).

From Heart Shaker, they transitioned into STRAWBERRY. That performance convinced me (not that I wasnt before) that Twice was fully capable of a sexy concept. When Sana did her  lines near the line, it had me [like](guy stumbling drunk gif). 

####Beyonce Sunbaenim stage was THE BEST stage. 

The sub-unit consisted of Dubu, Sana, and Tzuyu. It was very much a sexy concept and they nailed it perfectly. Words cant describe how I felt when the fans turned on and blew their hair. At the end of the performance, the Yess said over the sax near the end had my heart stopping each time.  The first time I saw it in LA, the guy next to me and I could not believe what we were seeing. I hopped on my DMs and messaged all my friends sitting in separate sections about the performance after it happened, WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO THAT?!

Immediately after Beyonce Sunbaenim sub-unit, Momo and Jihyo entered on the opposite side of the stage. They danced to TAEMINs Goodbye. This stage was powerful. The movements and energy were aggressive. It highlighted both of their dancing skills excellently! 

After their stage, Jeongyeon, Nayeon, and Chaeyoung took center stage. They danced along to Lady Gagas Born This Way. This stage took advantage of Chaeyoungs sassy persona well. One of my favorite parts of TWICELIGHTS was their backup dancers ninja dabbing their way onto the stage. When it first happened in LA, I thought, Surely this cant happen again. And it did. It happened again in Newark. So I knew what I had to look forward to here in Chicago! 

There was a slight intermission so that the girls could get into their Fancy outfits. They performed LOA first. The girl sat next to me in Chicago nudged me and said, Did they say theyre going to do a brand new song?! 

After LOA, they hopped into LIKEY. When this song first came out, I quoted it as a joke. Id see something and say, Me likey likey likey. Little did I know, this would be a song I belt out the most at their concerts. The crowd was so energetic when Momos BB     line came up. Admittedly, I was one of those people who yelled that line, but the venue roared when, Me likey likey likey came up. I could totally live with more Momo dance breaks because her dance break in LIKEY is so captivating. That was such a privilege to see live.

Then they performed What Is Love? WIL is one of my favorite TWICE songs because I was in San Francisco when they released that song. Every time the song starts, I remember the cool, rainy breeze drifting through my hotel window, the bustling of downtown San Francisco below, and the smell of the sea-salt pier. It remains one of my favorite songs simply because of where I was and what I was able to experience in San Francisco at the time. So, it was a pleasure to see it live again since they also performed it at KCONLA.

TTs stage was different in Chicago because of the stage length. In LA and Newark, they lined up along the walkway from the center stage to the main stage and did the TT dance to the crowd. Since the stage wasnt that long in Chicago, they walked to the main stage and continued the dance.

FANCY was the song I lost my voice to every single night. Seeing hundreds of people lift their hands up and do the FANCY/love hand sign was amazing. 

After they did FANCY, they retreated backstage and the TWICELIGHTS logo came up. Funnily enough, there were many people at all three stops that left at this point. 

The screen came back up and a few games were played with the crowd (via VCR). Im blanking on the order of the games, but Im pretty sure it went:

* Answer the question. An audience member had to answer the question that was on the screen. First question was what was the name of the tour and the second question is Will Twice always be in your heart? Your options were: YES or YES. 

* Dance like TWICE. An audience member was picked out of the crowd and was filmed dancing to FANCY. Then it cut to another audience member and then DTNA came on. 

* Sing the song. They asked the audience to sing the song lyrics that were highlighted in purple. Each arena used FANCY as the song for the audience to sing along to.

* Cheer for Twice. This was the last game and it was VCR generated, so the arena couldve been dead quiet and it wouldve worked LOL. But each arena erupted with applause and cheers during this game.

After the last game, the VCR popped up and said, TWICE Is coming back out to greet you!

When they came back out, their encores were SIGNAL and KNOCK KNOCK. These are two of my favorite songs (especially SIGNAL), so I was disappointingly thinking that they were cut out of the setlist. It was a pleasant surprise to see them perform these two as the last songs!

After KNOCK KNOCK finished, they lined up side by side on stage and made their final greetings. 

####Final Greetings for Chicago

Jihyo almost started with the waterworks, but caught herself before crying. She said she hopes to come back.

Nayeon was so sweet. She said, Before I came here, many of my friends said that I would enjoy Chicago. Any time she finished a sentence, shed bust out a smile and looked at all of us LOL.

It was either Sana or Momo who called SH-KAH-GO as SHIII-KAH-GO. It was still adorable to hear. Then she had to back track through her whole English sentence because she messed up the end of the sentence. 

Dubu said this at all the stops, but it stuck with me every time and its something I think Ill take for myself, Although were physically apart, well always be together emotionally/mentally. The first time she said this in LA, some guy in front of us yelled, You speak better than my girlfriend RIP LMAO.  

Before Chae could start talking, Nayeon spoke up and said, Hey, are you trying to do a sexy concept? Chaes outfit showed her shoulder. Nayeon came running over and put the sleeve back over her shoulder. Chae made a face to the crowd and then pulled the strap back down. Nayeon came rushing back over and covered Chae with her body. 

Jeongyeon started tearing up as she talked about this stop being the last for North America. She said, I know there are prettier and more talented artists than us, so Im glad that you all support us. 

Immediately after that was translated for the audience, the collective groans and agony within the Wintrust was hilarious! 

She then went on to say that the group will try their best to come back to Chicago again.

They took a group photo with the audience and then commenced their final song.
Their final performance was a slower version of Stuck. As they sang the song, the girls moved back to the stage prop, took their seats, and it retracted behind the screens. At all three stops, the girls HAMd up their exit by acting silly (making faces, doing funny dances, etc.).

In Newark, some of the girls (Nayeon especially) didnt have their footing and almost fell when the stage prop started to retract. 

In Chicago, Momo and Nayeon were HAMing it up as soon as the prop started to retract.

###Summary

Mina was in everyones hearts at all the stops. No doubt about it. The girls and the fans greatly missed her. Ill never forget the emotions the girls showed when they saw the sea of Mint/Teal. Ill also never forget how loud each venue was when we started chanting Minas name. 

Dahyun had so much confidence in her English. It was so impressive. The only time I remember her transitioning to Korean was when she asked Momo what the next song was. I think the only reason she did that too was because she missed a cue or took a line that Momo was supposed to have. She also gave all ONCEs a new response to anything: Nice. 

Jeongyeon really put her heart on her sleeve. I have a newfound appreciation for her. They give her the fierce tomboyish vibe, but shes really all into her feelings. My perception of her (not that it was bad before) changed the most out of all the other members after this tour.

Also, I apologize if I missed out on anything. Its funny to me that I went to all three stops and some of it is still a bit foggy, but I can remember the Liverpool vs. Borussia Dortmund game with ease. 

And thats my fan account of each stop! I had an amazing time at each stop. I got to meet new friends in Chicago and Newark. It was hilarious seeing peoples eyes widen when they heard I came from Phoenix, AZ to attend the shows . 
I hope to see them again someday. Ive been thinking about going to Shizuoka for their show there, but well have to see!

3888,2019-7-28,2019,7,28,6,cin9zs,Urge BTS /Big Hit to speak out against violent fans (petition),codysyrum,1564263250,"This past week DKDKtv YouTube host Danny Kim and Billboard Kpop journalist Tamar Herman (who is Jewish) had a frank YouTube discussion about the future of that industry and they critiqued the current popularity tactics of the BTS company Big Hit. Specifically BTS centric attitude of the marketing of the band with apps such as WeVerse and BTSWorld. They also lamented the media saturation in the West of only BTS to the exclusion of new and exciting bands. [They also expressed that TXT wasnt going to be the next big thing with older fans as they are targeted to young teens - which is very true]

Since this video came out there have been rape and death threats made against these music journalists by members of the BTS ARMY fanbase. Story here.
To date: Nobody from the band, company, or larger fanbase has countered the violence of these threats. They remain silent.
Danny, (DKDKTV) exhausted from the threats against his guest and the abhorrent attacks on his journalist - he was DOING HIS JOB as a very experienced Korean media analyst and former manager - decided to go on indefinite hiatus. His guest, who is Jewish returned from her Sabbath worship to read several death and rape threats against her. See below for her comments on reddit about it

In fact, many BTS Army continue to harrass Danny with character assassinations on his personal twitter account saying that he has no right to tell these Army members to go fuck yourself - personally I think Dannys anger and fear are COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED. Nonetheless, the hate continues to pour forth from multiple BTS Armys on Dannys twitter account even after he has said he needs a break from twitter and YouTube.

Such sexist and racist violence should not be tolerated by BTS band members or the larger fanbase. Sign the The worlds platform for change petition BELOW if you want the band or company to admonish the violent people in their fanbase as soon as possible. The members are probably the only people that this fanatic subgroup [which I call #naziArmy]

Fans: if you are going to call yourselves an ARMY then there is some implied responsibility for what members of your ranks do, what they write/say, and how they act. Silence = Death. In this case by tacit allowance (doing nothing) against the violent sect that exists within YOUR fanbase.

Consider boycotting BTS, BigHit, and their fanbase Army if nothing is said or done to stop this intimidation within a few days. I
if Army and fans remain silent, then you implicitly and passively condone the continuation of this kind of FANtimidation. Take action, click the petition.
As for my own actions/ contributions:

I have been answering questions about Kpop and BTS for several weeks, some campy (if the questions are ridiculous ones about whether they are gay), some well informed and researched, and some very detailed blogs about people who put BTSs fame in jeapordy. I have garnered over 40K views for my responses - free promotion for BTS as a fan (I am NOT Army)

Until I hear from a BTS member or BigHit to formally denounce this extreme fan-threats of violence; I will no longer support or discuss BTS on Quora or anywhere else [if BTS Army continues to threaten freedom of speech and opinion, my personal boycott will remain]

Its ONLY MUSIC PEOPLE!!

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc.  [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cgc433/nugu_roundup_3_lets_make_a_splash_for_flashe/).    While thus far I've been concentrating on currently-active groups, I'm adding a new segment this week to pay respects for groups that disbanded before they graduated from Nugudom.  

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show.  The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.  

&amp;#x200B;

**And now onto the show...**

&amp;#x200B;

**GWSN** 

**Who are they?:**  GWSN, the romanized Korean abbreviation for 'Gongwon Sonyeo' which translates to 'Girls in the Park' is a 7 member girl group under Kiwi Pop.

**Company:** Kiwi Pop is a subsidiary of Kiwi Media Group.  They're a pan-Asian entertainment company with acting, music academy, and talent management subdivisions.  Kiwi Pop also represents Nick&amp;Sammy, a male musical duo.

**Genre:** House/Electronic

**Members:**

* Minju: Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Rapper. Says Chungha and SinB are her role models, was torn between wanting to be an idol and a marine animal trainer growing up.  18 years old (IA).  Real name: Kang Minju.  [Self introduction video](https://youtu.be/NczWuwBrBmk?t=578).
* Soso: Nationality: Taiwanese.  Main Dancer, Vocalist.  Makes quick friends with other idols while promoting together, including Loona's Olivia Hye and (G)I-DLE's Minnie, Shuhua, and Yuqi.  Learned Japanese to be able to better communicate with GWSN's other foreign member Miya.  18 years old (IA).  Real name: Wang Chingyi.  [Self introduction video](https://youtu.be/NczWuwBrBmk?t=390).  
* Lena: Main Vocalist, Maknae.  Did an AMA previously here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b3pfad/hi_this_is_ama_with_lena_of_gwsn/)).  She's another 'giant maknae' and is the tallest in the group despite being the youngest.  Went to school in the USA for a period and thus speaks English well. 17 years old (IA).  Real name: Kang Lena.  [Self introduction video](https://youtu.be/NczWuwBrBmk?t=37).  

**Debut:** GWSN debuted September 5th, 2018 with [Puzzle Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aNKhuKk7u0) from their first album The Park in the Night Part I.  [Link to first promotional stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk97qL3bZD8). Link to a [Pre-Debut busking performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyeZhSLwe94).

**Most recent comeback:** GWSN had a comeback this week with [Red Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91fL1yk_WC0) from The Park in the Night Part III.  Link to [first live stage for most recent comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah5MJEmXNjo).  Link to [Reddit album discussion for their most recent comeback album](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cgq5uz/gwsn_the_park_in_the_night_part_three_the_3rd/).  

**Other MVs:** [Pinky Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5RHf916uDU), the title track from The Park in the Night Part II.  [Growing for Groo special clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4c2ksykqio) (their fan song).

**Dance Videos:** Dance cover of [Seventeen's Mansae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mac85QC1QGg) (pre-debut).  [Pinky Star choreography video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edDcMaEW7Sk).  [Growing For Groo dance practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5gFSLDuRnU). [Choreography/Song Mashup of BTS' DNA and Blackpink's Whistle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7_iudq-GUY)

**Variety:**  [GWSN on Weekly Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrmTwP9ySKM).   GWSN has their own reality series called Got Ya GWSN, but I can't seem to find English subbed versions.

**Vlogs:** [GWSN YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUT58qBbE4Y3Y4FClOJOfrg). 

**Trivia:** Before joining GWSN [Miya was in a VIXX cover group called BAXX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALaZnYlI94I).  Due to her preference for wearing pants and atypical style many netizens were confused about her role in the group pre-debut and thought she was a cosplayer.  GWSN has peppered their teasers and MVs with various inspirational and philosophical quotes.  Their fandom name 'Groo' is Korean for tree-stump.  Kiwi Pop had initially thought their Taiwanese recruitment drive was a bust until one of their agents saw Soso running around at school and convinced her to audition.

**Active:** August 28th 2018 - July 21st 2019

**Reason for disbanding:** One member wanted to pursue other endeavors, an unfortunate death knell for a three member group.  

**Light at the end of the tunnel:** Leader Han Choim who managed, produced, styled, promoted, and led the group has apparently garnered the attention of many in the industry due to her skills and work ethic, we may see more of her in the future.

**Trivia:** Choim was a former member of Laysha, member Yubeen was a former member of 1NB.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it for this week.  The last couple of weeks I've made the main highlight feature for a group that had a comeback the previous week, is that something y'all like?  While it won't be possible every week, I could keep doing that, or I could have it for a group that's about to comeback the following week, let me know what you think.  

&amp;#x200B;

Let me also know if there's any particular info or content you'd like for me to try to dig up.  My goal is to learn Hangul and Korean and thus be able to dig deeper than the English-speaking Internet allows me to, but that's obviously going to take quite a long time.  I'm learning about these groups as I do this a lot of the time, so please feel free to add information I may have missed or incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutout to u/not-named-in-credits and his sub r/nugutown for shining light on groups like this every day of the week.

Another album I like to listen to is IUs Palette album. The ballads there strums my heartstrings. Overall, the album does not disappoint. IUsus serves in this one.

Lastly, EXIDs Eclipse mini-album. The title track just does it for me. I listen to it at night because I feel night really suits the vibe of the songs in the album (If you are going for a ride at night, play NRTD, it is awesome) 

What are your favorites? ",181,166

Last week had a lot of great songs like Baekhyun's solo debut,  NCT's Japanese songs, Oh My Girl's lovely music, and more! The highest rated song of last week was **Red Velvet's Sunny Side Up** with an overall score of __8.78!__ Congrats to Red Velvet!

Again, I don't have anything planned so these songs were all kinda chosen haphazardly? I tried choosing/finding a couple of ""love songs"" as well as trying to put on an artist who hasn't appeared on Jukebox yet! Here we go! These are this week's songs:

1. [MV] [GFriend - Time for the Moon Night ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XyBa8QsVQU)
2. [Ben - Thank You For Goodbye ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tO_eJek6D8)
3. [BTS - Euphoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTiIZBFpfok)
4. [Chungha - Love U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOnndZJ8y8)
5. [ASTRO - Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwqEXtsvaDg)
6. [Red Velvet - Milkshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLMzYDIHdVs)
7. [ONF - Complete (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka9zaVL28OY)

Want to participate in this week's Jukebox? Here's a quick guide! Each week you get the chance to review seven songs on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is not euphoric, and 10 being this song makes your life complete! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

4036,2019-7-29,2019,7,29,13,cj6cf3,Has going to a concert made you change your bias?,AlleeShmallyy,1564374647,"So, I went to my first kpop concert. I went to see Monsta X in Dallas, I went into the concert a heavy Wonho bias and came out a Joohoney and Hyungwon bias. 

Wonho is beautiful and he's one of my favorite vocalists, but Joohoney has this incredible stage presence. Seeing him rap up close is insane and seeing him play drums... Wow.

Hyungwon looks angelic close up and I was mesmerized by his dancing. My eyes always found him. And holy crap, DJ H.One. Next level, really. I was losing it over him.

So, my question here is have you ever changed your bias after seeing that groups concert? Who was your bias before, and who was it after? What caused you to change your bias?",117,73
4037,2019-7-29,2019,7,29,13,cj6fun,Who is your go-to YouTube reviewer/reactor?,kbdsct,1564375229,"I think its safe to say that a lot of YouTubers now react to eagerly awaited Kpop groups to get their views spiked up, but there definitely are a lot of genuine fans of the genre whose enthusiasm is infectious. I generally dont like reactors who pepper their videos with 99% positive words because it just comes off as a little disingenuous, and I absolutely cant stand those who only talk in catchphrases (from Yass Queen to Slayyy to Snatchedddd to Shook Shook Shook). 

Before that photo scandal which I still dont have closure on, I used to look forward to MRJKPOPs analysis of songs because I really do find the elements in so many Kpop songs to be super interesting. I know Reacttothek has their fan base at this point but I am lukewarm to their content, even though I appreciate how academically inclined their notes are. 

There are feel-good channels that I do like, for example K!Junkies. They are never afraid to admit their dissatisfaction with songs even from major groups, they have good chemistry and they do have a good eye/ear on choreography and musical motifs. I used to like watching 105 Degrees but is it just me or  they look a little done with it now?",68,17

I think such incidents are quite common in outdoor performances or at least those that aren't in a regular network studio. So I remembered back a few years on how badass it can be when the singer(s) just does their thing even without the music. There's also this one of [Ailee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sXqSR_UXpY) in KCON NY 2016 and this one of [Lee Hi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9BmbVqQMJg) in Yonsei University. 

Have you seen other instances where the idol/singer literally just brushed off the technical difficulty and just continued like a PRO?",66,106

(week 49),ThisGuyKpops,1564409386,"Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

P.S: I finished my 4th video on [I.O.I](https://youtu.be/WYualQj2YDA). Still need more work on getting better. but i'm getting better! = D

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",4,26

&amp;#x200B;

NCT fans, also known as NCTzens, have taken to Twitter and other social media platforms to express their outrage regarding SM Entertainment's alleged mistreatment of the members.

Recently, member Renjun was seen running around outside in the rain without an umbrella, without a manager, and without his members. Several fans have pointed out that one of NCT's managers allegedly prioritized her own shelter from the rain above Renjun's as she was seen entering the vehicle while Renjun waited out in the rain for another vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

[Renjun standing alone, out in the rain, with no manager, no members, and no umbrella](https://i.redd.it/8olfmct1xcd31.jpg)

After seeing videos and pictures of the event, fans began to spread the hashtag ""[**#SM\_\_**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SM_%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%8C%80%EC%9A%B0_%EA%B0%9C%EC%84%A0%ED%95%B4?src=hashtag_click)"" which means, ""Improvement of SMArtist Treatment."" The hashtag even trended worldwide, accumulating over 500,000 tweets as of July 29, 2019,1:30 AM (EDT). Fans are also calling for NCTzens and SM stans to unsubscribe from SMTOWN on Youtube in order to attempt to get SM Entertainment's attention. SMTOWN has lost over 100,000 subscribers thus far.

  


[A message spread by NCT fan sites calling for NCTzens to unsubscribe from all SMTOWN social media](https://i.redd.it/gm3d9xalxcd31.jpg)

This is not the first incident that has gotten NCTzens enraged. In a Vlive with members Renjun, Chenle, and Jisung, Renjun began to talk about another NCT member, Win Win, who is currently promoting in China with NCT's China subunit, WayV. Win Win is also considered a member of NCT 127. A staff member quickly cut Renjun off, and the reprimand was loud enough that fans watching the broadcast could hear it. Soon after, Renjun was told to change seats with another member so that he was no longer in the middle spot.  


In another Vlive, Renjun enthusiastically spoke of his personal vacation. He excitedly showed pictures to fans and the other members with him. A staff member supposedly cut Renjun off again, saying """" (deokchyeo) to him, which is a rude way of saying ""shut up.""

NCTzens were quick to point out that Renjun is not the only member who has allegedly received unfair treatment. Win Win is well-known among fans for being a victim of unequal line distribution, both in NCT 127 and WayV.

On an earlier Vlive broadcast, member Yuta posed the question, ""Who are you most afraid of? Be frank.""Win Win was quick to respond with, ""The manager.""

&amp;#x200B;

A Jeno fan site described one of the managers as ""not being able to control her own loving hands.""

 Fans of NCT have come together in support of Renjun and all NCT members in hopes of achieving better treatment for them. NCTzens are now demanding a response from SM Entertainment regarding the recent controversies involving Renjun and the mismanagement of SM's foreign artists.",9,23

I don't dive much into the details of sales and marketing surrounding Kpop, I enjoy the music, the performers and all the encompass this world.

But I admit that I don't really get into how and what exactly the companies aim to go with these groups. 

In terms of music I do feel that in the last 5-6 years it's becoming more of a trend to use what it's consider appealing to western audiences, and the western audience has grown immensely. 

But Asia still represent the main source of revenue for Kpop, right? 

So even with a more broad spectrum in terms of music, the main focus for these companies is still in the east, correct? 

I find this very interesting but I never really got into it very much so I'd like to see what you guys think in this topic, especially if you're really into the metrics and numbers around it. 

I think it's a fun discussion to have.",20,0

I don't usually partake in anything like this, but I started noticing I have been straying away from Kpop recently. I was curious if this is something that most of you go through, periods where you just need a break from it. I got into Kpop almost two years ago and overall it's been a great journey and experience, not just from the new music and groups I discovered, but learning about Korean culture as well. I love listening to music, so my taste varies and I have songs from a bunch of genres on my phone. Right before Kpop, my go-to genre was usually alternative. I would be hesitant to be handed the aux to play my music, as it would go from hip-hop to Baroque real quick, so I would end up skipping through songs. When I added Kpop, it became harder to play music as nobody I knew listened to it. Which is why I now use an old phone just for Kpop. But now I've been listening less and less to it, and more to other genres. Surely I'll go back to listening to Kpop in a week or two, but I was wondering if this happens to a lot of you frequently.",36,21

They're labeled as criminals and there are no clear evidences yet. It looks like some people trying to bring down YG and Bigbang. 

First Seungri's scandal, there are not clear evidences yet but people labeled him as he is a criminal. South Korea never complained about building owners when a crime happened in the building before. But when Burning Sun scandal happened they immediately said it was Seungri's fault. 

Now they're doing it for Daesung. Recently a building that belongs to Daesung involved in a scandal and people say it's his fault. But he is in military and doesn't know what's going on outside and people say that those businesses was happening since 2005 and Daesung bought the building in 2017. Why government didn't do anything until now? Why it's been a scandal now when Daesung bought it? 

It looks like Bigbang's military service going to end soon and someone doesn't want Bigbang to comeback again. It looks like people trying to take down YG and Bigbang by using media.

They're targeting all Bigbang members and fans are worried about Taeyang now. He never involved in a scandal yet and fans are worried because they think he's the next target. 

What do you think about scandals? Is it a mediaplay to bring down YG and Bigbang?",20,0

DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEN UNTIL THEY MAKE A STATEMENT AND UNFOLLOW SM ENTERTAINMENT BUT DONT UNFOLLOW THE ARTIST CHANNELS. They left Renjun in the rain with no umbrella with NO PROTECTION he could have been kidnapped by saesangs or worst then that. And that fucking manager could have gave renjun that green umbrella since her stupid ass didnt want Renjun to be in the rain. And her telling Renjun to shut up talking about his vacation in Jeju-do WTF. And he cant even talk about WinWin one of his hyung's and he loves WinWin a lot. ISNT WINWIN APART OF NCT EVEN THO HE DOESNT GET LINES? AND JENO BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED BY THE MANGER. THEY ARE THE YOUNGEST GROUP. Thats all i have to say BOYCOTT SM ENTERTAINMENT IT WILL WORK. Im sorry for cursing tho i had to this really pisses me off its disgusting.,1,0

I am new to K Pop and I was looking for songs with an Electro vive to them.

To give you an exemple, I really like Sober and Crooked by Big Bang , and Rocking by Teen Top.

I am aware those songs are old and this is what I am looking for.
Those songs have an aura that screams early to mid 2010s (at least for me)

Thank you :D",1,0
