 &amp;nbsp;

These posts have a few aims: 

 &amp;nbsp;

To provide the mods a place to feedback what discussions have taken place amongst the mod team that may be relevant to the sub and to get feedback on them. 

To get feedback on recent and upcoming changes to the sub. 

To give you guys another way to communicate with the mod team! 

 &amp;nbsp;

If you dont get a response to something raised here right away then please bear with us, it may be that the mods are busy at that time and will get you when they are free or they may have wanted to clarify something with the mod team or another mod.  

**Check out the archive of our Town hall posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/townhall).**

&amp;nbsp;

--- 

 **Agenda**

1. Rule Change trial  Twitter sources. 

1. Music show post - Update 

1. Homework Help 

1. Post Flairs 

1. Update on Wiki 

1. AOB 

&amp;nbsp;

 ---

&amp;nbsp;

    Rule Change trial  Twitter sources. 

&amp;nbsp;

~~First up on the agenda we are implementing a new rule on a trial basis. **[This rule is now live](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)**, buit we would like feedback on if it should stay/clarifications to the rule!~~

**Edit: This rule was added from disucssion raised in last townhall's post, Based on the feedback so far here though I have removed it. Please keep giving feedback on how you feel about this twitter sources (particulalry those that do not reference an original source.)**

*""Twitter must not be used as a source unless it is the original source. Tweets cannot substitute for a full translation""*

We would like your feedback on what you think of the rule/what you would like as the limits to the rule so we can tweak this for next months Town hall. 

&amp;nbsp;

 We are also adding a rule based form feedback last month.  

*""Blind items should not be posted. (Blind items are stories like 'Person A caught with drugs', 'Top star caught in sex scandal').""* 

Again this will initially be on a trial basis, so let us know here what you think. 

 
&amp;nbsp; 

    Music Show Post - Update 

 &amp;nbsp;

From last Town hall we took the two top ideas and intended to trial both. One was the use of wiki post and the other was live threads.  

 
Unfortunately we did not get enough volunteers for a feasible trial of Live threads. 

Fortunately, we think wiki posts are going quite well and only getting better. 

Can you feed back about how you feel about how music show posts have been over the next couple of weeks. Do you like the new way? What improvements would you like to see? 

As it stands we are going to continue with the posts this way for while but we are open to feedback as to how they are doing and where to go next! 

&amp;nbsp; 

    Homework Help 

 &amp;nbsp;

We are proposing (dependent on your feedback) a rule about 'Homework help' style questions. This includes polls for assignments or otherwise Kpophelp style questions for assignments. 

Before we add this rule we want to know if you like these posts, are indifferent or would like to see them removed from the community. Let us know!! 

 &amp;nbsp;

    Topic Flairs 

&amp;nbsp;

We are going to tidy up your post flairs as there is some content that doesn't have an appropriate flair. 

**What flairs would be useful for you on posts?**

 &amp;nbsp;

    Update on Wiki 

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't forgotten your suggestions, I have a couple of weeks off of work coming up and hope to get some done then! 

 &amp;nbsp;

    AOB 

&amp;nbsp;

Any other business? What else would you like to ask, feedback or talk to us about? ",79,54

His username is ""ericnamdumbo"". In one of his latest posts (22 hours since this post has gone up) he, Tablo and Gallant are all on the streets of Hong Kong together with the caption [""Gallant X Tablo X Eric Nam""](http://imgur.com/a/i0heA) (sorry for the terrible screenshots). 


Eric Nam and Tablo have been teasing [Cave Me In since their spread for W Korea](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNGIJSyjwO8/?taken-by=realericnam). 


Stage is likely to be a surprise since YG has already stated no artists will be attending MAMA 2016, and Tablo has not given any notice of heading to Hong Kong in any of his SNS.

To be frank, I haven't ventured out to too many artists and groups and have only stuck with a small few. I am still learning about the kpop culture and industry every day, and I would love some suggestions to help me expand on this. Thanks!!

I also wanted to ask this because as much love as there is in this world, a lot of artists are also hated which makes me avoid them. Of course, a lot of hate are from anti fans and false accusations, so it would be cool to hear from an actual fan that probably knows them a little bit better.

Hi guys. Idk if you guys remember me from my post about visiting the Blanc and Eclare flagship store in Soho(it got removed ). Anyway I just left the grand opening/fan signing and I wanted to share the experience with you all since many requested it. So I showed up around 6:30(it was officially supposed to start at 7:30). There were a decent crowd of people, maybe like 200 in total? At first it was a bit messy as the official guests were mixed with fans who just showed up but after a while everything was sorted and lines were made. I was very impressed by the staff, they were really calm and they even remembered my name from prior visit. I really appreciated that. So anyway, onto the good stuff. Once I got inside, the store was divided by ropes and on one side was the fansign and the other was the actual grand opening party with invited guests and press. I brought an album for Jessica to sign as well as a Dimension 4 concert shirt for Krystal to sign. Unfortunately, Krystal disappeared once the fan signing began so I didn't get to see her(). So once I finally got in front of Jessica, I was in actual awe. She's insanely beautiful and I've seen a lot of female celebrities here in the city but Jessica is something else. Her blonde hair suits her so well. She's the definition of stunning. I've met her before briefly at a fashion show but actually getting one on one contact with her was surreal.  Anyway Jessica said ""Hi, how are you? I like your cardigan"". Inside I was like ""UM JESSICA JUNG LIKES MY CARDIGAN?!? GOD IS REAL AND GOOD"" but I miraculously was able to carry on the conversation like a normal person and replied ""Really? Thanks! I thought you'd compliment my scarf actually""(I was wearing a B&amp;E scarf). She laughed and said something like ""I designed it so I thought it was implied that I like it"". So I took out my album and told her I actually had her sign it once already at fashion week. She was surprised and said ""Really? I think I remember you. Were you wearing sunglasses or something then?""( I WAS). I was taken aback by the fact that she kinda recognized me. Like how does someone with so many fans remember that? Anyway so the ""With Love, J"" album comes in a box with the actual album inside. Jessica signed the front of the box when I met her earlier this year. So she told me it'd be better if she signed the actual album instead of two signatures on box cover and she opened it and asked for my name and signed it. I won't include the whole conversation as it's a memory I want to keep for myself but I will say that it was just amazing. I didn't feel rushed at all. Jessica was warm and laughed and listened to my words intently. I'll remember it forever. I didn't trust myself to tell her everything I wanted to so I wrote a letter and she took that with a smile and said she'd read it on the plane. Oh but I will tell you that I got to talk to her a little about her comeback. I told her how surprised I was that she was having a comeback so soon and that she spoils us too much. She laughed and said ""I love giving you guys music to listen to so I'm just as excited as you are"". I then quickly asked what kind of sound we'd be getting for this new single and she did the mouth zipping motion and said sorry and to just wait a little longer for details. I was so wrapped up in the conversation that I forgot to ask for a picture which I'm not really that sad about as I'm just thankful I had such great conversation with her. I felt like I was drifting on a cloud as I left the store.  

So overall just a really amazing experience for me. I'm so thankful that I didn't freeze up or anything once I got in front of her. I'm beyond excited for her comeback and I hope I get to meet her again so she could sign my copy of her next album. 

Oh and I have a few pictures which I will add once I get home!

Sorry if this is hard to read. I was high off Jessica as I was writing this 

EDIT: Here's some pictures and an awesome short video I took!

Article from [Allkpop] (http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/12/exo-concert-stage-director-claims-mama-twice-x-ioi-stage-was-copied-from-his-work):

&gt; The '2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards' featured a TWICE x IOI collaboration video, in which the girls turned into adorable fairies who make music, and the fans loved how cute TWICE and IOI looked in this video.

&gt; However, Kwon Soon Wook, BoA's older brother, MV director, and a stage director for EXO concerts, claims that this cute video plagiarized his work. 

&gt; Indeed, when you watch the two videos side by side, there are some striking similarities:

&gt; The stage director expressed his disapproval on his social media accounts:

One wrote, *""I can't be the only one who noticed how similar they are...""* Another said, *""'MAMA' is terrible in so many ways.""* Another netizen argued, however, *""The overall concept is similar, but you have to realize this a very generic concept.""* Others disagreed, *""If the person who created it feels like it was copied, we should take it seriously.""*",40,144

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

As you can see, it's pretty far :(


She started off with a sexy version of Twenty-Three (she changed it to Twenty-Four since that's her age now), and it was great! 

[Addressing the audience for the first time](http://imgur.com/QEcutMm) There was this funny thing where the audience would cheer every time she drank from her water bottle.

The concert included a lot of her just talking about her path so far as a singer. My proficiency in Korean isn't enough to catch everything she said, but the general gist was this:

As a trainee, she had many painful memories and always doubted herself. She thought all the older trainees were better at singing and were more beautiful. She would often talk about her experiences for a bit, and it would transition into a performance of a song that was relevant in some way. 

For example, she gave a small anecdote of how she wrote the song ""Knees"" or  one night when she couldn't sleep. She hopes that this song can serve as a lullaby for some people. 

She also told a story about 2014, when she finally felt like she realized that she was a singer. She wanted to help her friends High4 with the track ""Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms"" (which she sadly only sang one line of during the concert), and she was very nervous about it. She really wanted the song to do well. Around the same time, Akdong Musician (one of my first favorite Korean artists) came out with ""200%"", so she was extra concerned about the competition (she also said that she really liked that song). To her relief, both songs did very well on the charts. 

[And then..](http://imgur.com/2REMyHV)

Akdong showed up!!! The moment I heard ChanHyuk's voice, the audience (including me) got pretty hyped. They performed 2 songs only, but it was very nice. They performed 200% and ""How people move"". They then gave a small talk about how much they respected IU, and went off stage.

Then, to my delight, she did some covers of Korean OSTs for Japanese anime. One of my favorites of all time being Slam Dunk, I was happy when I saw Sakuragi Hanamichi on the screen behind IU. She also performed Marshmellow and a person in a very cute Marshmellow costume was on stage for a bit. She also performed Leon, with the audience playing Park MyungSoo's part. They actually did an amazing job, being loud and knowing all the lyrics. She also performed  (Merry Christmas in Advance), which was actually one of my favorite songs. 

[After that, it was photo time!!](http://imgur.com/UQJyjVi)

She said that for her last song, she would perform ""Good Day"", which indeed it was. Yes, she hit the notes. After the lights faded, the audience yelled ""encore"" for a good five minutes, and she showed up on near the second floor!!

[I took bad photos :(](http://imgur.com/fEDu9n5) but she was really close!!

She sang Shower and (Heart). Then she said that since we were so loud when asking for an encore, she would do one more song. She concluded the concert with a performance of (Hey). 

First of all, I'm very grateful to my friend for informing me that seats were still available. It was one of the best experiences I've had in Korea so far! Unforunately, I did not propose to her when she rolled around the corner since I'm still waiting patiently for Jang Kiha  to step aside. Anyway, she said she will be performing overseas after the new year, so support her if you can!


She also did say that she's hoping for a new album by next year",23,117

&gt; If you're only willing to believe in one side of the story your not willing to hear the truth. We've never said a bad word about her.


&gt; They used the ""collaboration"" to promote the show: and then ""someone"" took it away from the fans and the fans deserved to see that:



&gt; We flew to the other side of the world to do this.


&gt; She performed. Then wiz performed. So it was 100% possible to do it. They took it away from you the fans.



&gt; At one point we were told that they didn't want her next to wiz on camera because he was too tall next to her. Why would we make this up?


&gt;Tay is smart enough to make her own decisions. If she wanted to do it she would of.


&gt; Funny Tay fans want to criticize me but they also want me to release the track.


&gt; We didn't say a bad word about her: we flew 15 hours and came a day early to rehearse and she said ""she went back to hotel""


&gt; Why didn't she stay for the rehearsal? We flew that day then rehearsed. And why didn't she stay?


&gt; The bottom line is Wiz and Tay are both great artist: and ""someone"" took away a great moment for the fans.



&gt; They did tell us she went to hospital. But why didn't she say that to you fans? 


&gt; And we waited PAST 1Am to rehearse. Why couldn't she wait? They told us she had to go to hospital: but she didn't tell you that.


&gt; We don't need to make anything up: we came out and we played. That's it: thank you for the fans who came to see a great show!


&gt; Again I am not blaming Tay. It was emotional that we came all the way and the collab didn't happen. Now they trying to blame our equipment.


&gt; It's about being positive and spreading love. That's it. You guys are misunderstanding this. We are just dissapointed that it didn't happen.


&gt; Who's ever decision it was. They took away a great moment for music and the fans.

&gt; I'd be willing to release the track if you guys weren't so aggressive. Gees.

&gt; If you guys want me to stop talking about it I will. Sending lots of love to all the music lovers. Peace!

&gt; I hope people are as passionate in their own lives as they are about other people's.

&gt; Thanks to the person who DM's this. [(Linked Picture)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyxB5VlUsAA7ZyT.jpg:large)

T/N: V and B are the same in romanization when it comes to Korean. 


Options were:


Name | Meaning
:--|:--|:--|
VLOOM | VLOOM = Voice + Bloom meaning that VROMANCE and their fans would become one and bloom together
vom () | t/n:  = Bom = adjective of looking. Fans will always ""look"" to VROMANCE and no one else. 
VROMATE () |  VROMANTE = VROMANCE + mate meaning someone who can always support VROMANCE. Can be seen as soulmates as well as mates (friends).
VROCCOLI () | Broccoli spelled with a V. Broccoli has 5 benefits, one of which is providing energy. VROMANCE can provide ""VROCCOLI"" with energy through their singing, and ""VROCCOLI"" can support VROMANCE with their energy.
LP () | L(ee) + P(ark). Chandong and Hyunseok's last names are Lee. Hyunkyu and Janghyun's last names are Park. LP also means helper. Will help/support VROMANCE by listening to their music.

298,2016-12-5,2016,12,5,2,5ggdqu,[FAN ACC] Amber at AsianTVAwards in Singapore,Razorange,1480871299,"While the rest of the kpop world was freaking out over MAMA2016, the f(x) fans of Singapore (and some from neighbouring countries!!!) were gathered for Amber's solo performance at the Asian TV Awards 2016. Amber's appearance was pretty much a gift that dropped from the sky; the awards show itself is kinda low key in Singapore so even as a local I had no idea about its existence till Amber [tweeted](https://twitter.com/llama_ajol/status/802863525139886081?lang=en) about it (and yes ATA organisers officially announced her appearance only 5 days before the show). Since the announcement was really last minute I was really surprised that the local fansite managed to secure a whole stack for MeUs...and get this, **for FREE**. So yeah if this isn't a gift from heaven idk what is!

The group of about 20-30 of us MeUs were sitting on the far right of the stage, from where we were sitting we could only see her head bobbing as she walked down the red carpet on the opposite end of the venue. Even though we weren't the biggest fandom in the venue, our screams + periwinkle lightsticks were more than enough to catch her attention. And Amber, being the sweetheart she is, [walked across the venue](https://twitter.com/taeyongscom/status/804663454384549888) to [make her way to our periwinkle pond](https://twitter.com/affxtionsg/status/804664161313525761) to greet us before she took a [selfie with us](https://twitter.com/llama_ajol/status/804667068171751424?lang=en) :)

For her first performance, Amber did Shake That Brass which was tons of fun. She looked comfortable alone as a solo artist, something she has grown into over time, and it probably helped that she had 4 familiar dancers that she's rather close with performing alongside her. She had great energy, and did her silly dances as usual, but the real gush of amazement came when Amber started singing the vocal featuring parts [by herself](https://youtu.be/6Xho9Jhb5-8?t=157). Even though it was pretty obvious that she would perform STB, there were questions surrounding who she would feature for the bridge (I had hopes that Luna would pop out in the middle of the stage but alas, she had a schedule on that day), or if the bridge would even be sung at all. For a moment I thought that Amber would've just played around while the backing vocals of Taeyeon would sing on...but Amber swooped in and took us all by surprise (and I'm sorry I ever doubted you Amber)! We were suspended in brief disbelief as she started the singing the bridge. Somehow we managed to gather our ~~shit~~ consciousness together to start screaming our lungs out in support of our Llama. And boy did Amber deliver. She's no Luna, but she nailed those high notes pretty accurately in spite of going a little crazy on the choreo lol. The dancers were also amazing as usual, after performing together all this time they definitely have some on stage understanding/chemistry that added more fun to the song.

Second song was Borders, which was an interesting choice to me. I was expecting Need to Feel Needed instead of the more sombre Borders for an awards show, but it somehow worked. I'm personally not a huge fan of the song, although watching the live performance is changing my mind about it by just a little...Sure, it was a tad emotional for an awards show, but it was an honest performance put up by Amber, and I think the general audience did appreciate that too. And I may be overthinking this a little but it felt like Amber frequently faced our group of MeUs during the song and it did feel like she was singing at us a lot which made me a little emotional as well.

Though it was just two songs, Amber put up a great show. She brought her energy in STB, her honesty in Borders and her kindness and warmth to us fans that unforgettable night. ",8,33

399,2016-12-6,2016,12,6,1,5gmz79,[FAN ACCOUNT] Jonghyun X Inspiration Concerts [x-post from r/SHINee],jolaurence,1480957116,"[Forgive me if there are any errors. It's 2 am over here and I have been working on this since 11 pm.]

Okay everyone! This is a call for you go get a snack, a beverage, a pillow if you need it to scream into. I went to all three performances of Jonghyun's concert this weekend and this is gonna be long but organized into three parts. Part 1 is the Set List. Part 2 is each concert performance. Part 3 is the concert as a whole. This was also my first official just SHINee related performance since moving to South Korea. Let's get started, shall we? 

**Part 1: Set List**

I noticed this on the first night that the set list was designed in a way that shows both a sensual and sexual side of Jonghyun. I will go into that more in part 3 because this concert was very cohesive and this one fit unit. So this is what I have assigned to each song in the set list [in italics]. Some songs I am still very much in a ???? state because reasons. And just by looking at this, I can tell why this concert was 15+ for some ""exposure."" 

* Inspiration *[sexual]*
* Moon *[sexual]*
* Dress Up *[sexual]*
* Red *[sexual]*
* Aurora [VCR] *[sensual]*
* Playboy [mirrors] *[sexual?]*
* Orbit *[sensual]*
* Neon *[sensual]*
* Fine *[sensual]*

* **MENT** 

* Breathe *[sensual]*
* Love is so Nice *[sensual]*
* Love Belt [duet with Shawols] *[sensual]*

* **MENT**

* Gloomy Clock [with hand bells] *[sensual]*
* End of a Day *[sensual]*
* Suit Up [VCR] *[destruction]*
* Hallelujah *[sexual]*
* Cocktail [belt dance] *[sexual]*
* Mono-drama [mirrors] *[sensual]*

* **MENT**

* Beautiful Tonight [kazoos!] *[sensual]*
* Young and Rich (?) [VCR] *[?????]*
* White T-Shirt [cart] *[hype song]*
* She Is *[hype song]*
* Like You *[hype song]*
* Deja-Boo [duet with Shawols] *[hype song]*

**ENCORE:** 

* Crazy [bass] *[sexual?]*
* 02:34 AM *[sensual]*
* U&amp;I *[hype song]*
* Warm Winter *[sensual]*

The count:

* Destruction: 1
* Sexual: 8
* Sensual: 13
* Hype Song: 5

Try to keep this in mind for the next however long it takes you to read this. 

**Part 2: Concerts**

I'll be talking more about the songs with Day 1 more than Day 2. 
Day 1 was a long one because I needed the concert goods. I got to the venue around 5:37 am and was one of the first 200 in line. Sales started at 10 I got my goods shortly after 11 am. I bought the light stick (finally I feel officially a Shawol), the hand bell, the black coffee mug because aesthetic, and the photo book which is basically a constant attack from Jonghyun. WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT SIR????

The concert was supposed to start at 7 but it started late. They were playing SHINee songs, naturally, and the lowered the lights a little bit when they started Tell Me What To Do in which every one of us Shawols started doing the fanchant. I was in section A for this concert and in the second to last row but I was able to see everything. There were two males sitting in front of me. I had no idea if they were fans or not but they were super surprised when everyone started screaming the moment the first VCR started. Jonghyun shirtless, chained in a cage. HEY NOW! HEY NOW! THIS US WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF! I mean...

The overall description of this concert can be summed up as this: WHO SAID THIS WAS OKAY KIM JONGHYUN?????? Seriously. None of this was okay but all of it was okay. So much screaming happened from me and everyone around me. I may or may not have said ""have my child out loud"" at one point but I was honestly in a daze the entire concert. 

Time honestly stood still for the entire concert. The first MENT was nine songs in. By then I was already a shadow of my former self. Inspiration left me gasping for air. Rap God Jonghyun is a thing and I have lived. Moon had so many body rolls that I was literally getting angry at a person's chest. Dress Up's choreo was so lit and then at the end he threw off his shirt like OKAY. OKAY JONGHYUN. YOU DO THAT! He put it back on again for Red but still. STILL. The amount of times he also basically  had *moments* with the stage were endless. You know those dance moves some members of EXO do at their concerts that leave EXO-Ls in a mess of emotions and shouting ""no"" the entire time? Yeah. Jonghyun did that. To quote a message I sent to a friend back home ""it was like sex on the stage."" Pretty much up until the MENT I was having a hard time even functioning. Playboy live was beautiful. THE MIRRORS! I am a sucker for mirror related dances since I watch way too many dance related shows and they just make me so emotional. 

Jonghyun singing Breathe wrecked me something fierce. It's one of my favorite songs to have come out this year and hearing Jonghyun sing a song that he wrote that is a different person's song but is still Jonghyun's song left me in a state of emotions. Also, singing Love Belt with Jonghyun was just a beautiful experience. Shawols are just so wonderful. Then there was the music lesson that was Gloomy Clock. All of us who had hand bells started ringing them out loud and Jonghyun showed us what he wanted us to do. [SM, please let Music Class with Jonghyun be a thing because I would be there every day. MUSICALLY GIFTED KIM JONGHYUN!] After End of a Day, in which I and several others were in a ""sigh, why are you so wonderful?"" mood, Suit Up began. 

How do I even begin to describe Suit Up? I'm gonna save that for part 3. After being left frustrated, the next song began and from the first note I started screaming. I could tell it was Hallelujah right away. This song happens to be my favorite solo Jonghyun song after Diphylleia Grayi [side note: if this song had been sung at the concert, you would have been able to hear my tears]. I started crying right away. This song is an experience. Like oh my. I still can't even figure out the right words for this song and I saw it three times. THANKS FOR LEAVING ME SPEECHLESS JONGHYUN. 

Next was Cocktail and oh boy. OH BOY. The song is already one of my favorite songs but after this weekend it is up there because two words: BELT. DANCE. The lights dimmed and you could see Jonghyun put his hands at his waist and undo his belt in the shadow and the sounds that came out of my mouth were not even human. And the chant was next level. How he was moving with the belt....sdjkbhjkdfh;kjasdjhdsajk. 

Mono-drama was just simply gorgeous. THE CAMERA WORK! Then came the MENT in which everyone basiclaly shouted about kazoos. This song literally confirmed my theory that Shawols are just really talented. 

Now it's time to mention Young and Rich. The VCR was really funny and I mean I was busting a gut until that part happened. Yeah. I was disappointed and I knew it was gonna cause a lot of controversy right away. 

Right after the VCR was White T-Shirt which is so underrated. I turned and saw that he was on the cart and my first thought was ""Of course there is a cart. It wouldn't be a SHINee related concert without a cart."" He went right past my section and I felt blessed. The cart would bless me again on Day 2 for two different reasons. 

She Is was amazing. Just amazing. The fanchants were HUGE and loud and so wonderful. It basically was at that level until the concert ended. Also, singing Deja-Boo with Jonghyun was a blessing and a treat and I really love that song. 

The concert ended and we all sat down and started chanting Kim Jonghyun over and over again since we knew there was going to be an encore. The fan project was for Crazy and we were ready for it. We heard a bass guitar start and the stage opened and that was when I lost it. I went from sitting to standing to falling down in under a second because KIM JONGHYUN WAS PLAYING THE BASS GUITAR. I have a lot of feelings about pre-debut Jonghyun and his bass playing. Like, I could write an essay about my feelings for bass player Jonghyun. He looked so happy playing the bass. SO. HAPPY. Like sense of euphoria happy. 

Of course, during the encore section he started crying since he's Jonghyun and get emotional about everything. He was talking about how it's nearly ten years since he and SINee debuted and how he wants to be with them forever and all the related things. By this time, I'm crying because if he cries, I cry. Warm Winter, which left me a mess, finished and he was saying his good-byes and we started shouting Kim Jonghyun but he fixed it for us by telling us to shout SHINee. SHINee members are truly the biggest Shawols. 

END DAY 1. 

Day 2 was double concert day. I got to the venue around 1:30 pm to pick up my ticket and then went in. I was in section J this time and close to the stage and had a great view of the middle stage. So while everyone else was watching the Inspiration VCR, my eyes were directed at the cage. I had to see him be put into the cage. ~~He owns being shirtless and it's beautiful.~~ Section J was also where he exited the the cart. The afternoon concert was much more mellow in my opinion, probably because a lot of us were so tired from being there the day before. During Gloomy Clock, my section only had a few hand bells but we rocked it. 

It was during one part of the concert when I turned and looked towards section A when I realized something odd. There was a row of males wearing masks, hats, and hoodies trying not to attract attention to themselves. This already attracted attention because the majority of the audience were female. Huge shout out to the fanboys in the audience though that afternoon, including the biggest one, Go Youngbae. Instantly I knew it was NCT over there, failing at the light sticks. It's okay babies. You're still getting used to this. It was also confirmed after the concert that some of the members were there. 

After the concert ended, everyone was forced to use the bathrooms down below towards the field. I walked down towards the field when I saw some walk from that area. I heard four girls gasps and the man literally ducked his head down. Hi Go Youngbae! He wouldn't have been noticed if it wasn't for the fact that everyone needed to use the bathroom and you could only use the one bathroom outside. I am so excited to hear his thoughts about the concert on Blue Night this week. 

The evening concert was incredible. Everyone was into it. The moment the lights went down, everyone was already in the zone. For this concert I was in section C. THREE ROWS FROM THE AISLE WHERE THE CART WOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT DREAMS REALLY ARE MADE OF. The girl next to me was adorable. She was so into the concert. We were also pretty much jumping the gun before Jonghyun could show us how to do the hand bells or kazoos. Right when Love Belt finished, all of us got out our bells and started ringing them. Most of us had bene there all weekend. We knew what was next. 

I was mostly focused on Jonghyun for this show until I looked over towards section A again and noticed a male sitting down with very handsome hair, a wonderful jawline, and resisting the urge to stand up because if he did, everyone would know who he was. Oh Minho. The girls in that row noticed it was him as well and were helping him during Beautiful Tonight since he started holding the banner we were given for later. He's so adorable. 

During one of the MENTs, Jonghyun called out to see if there were any boys in the audience. There was one in section B who literally jumped up and down and shrieked. Everyone near section A started pointing towards Minho but he was telling them to stop. During Young and Rich, which by now we were singing the song, I kept watching Minho for his reaction of the height part. IT WAS PRECIOUS. Minho blew his own cover during White T-Shirt. Jonghyun came out on the cart and I started mentally preparing myself for my death. I'm lowkey glad he did not give me eye contact because I would have fallen down and just sobbed. Minho stood up finally and he's so tall. Minho was pretty much the biggest Shawol in the room at that point holding his two light sticks in the air with pride and doing the chants with us. When the cart reached his section, Minho climbed the rail to let Jonghyun know he was there. Jonghyun literally stopped for a section. SHINee supporting SHINee is EVERYTHING! 

Basically I spent the rest of the concert watching Minho and also Jonghyun. Minho was so confused at parts of the concert since we knew what was next. He also was super confused for 02:24 AM. Oh honey. Bless you. 

Warm Winter was beautiful this night. Jonghyun got emotional from the very start and was crying. It got to a point where he was crying so much he just stopped singing. The band stopped playing so he could collect himself again. We started yelling ""it's okay"" and ""we love you"" as he wiped away his tears. Everyone around me, including me, was crying as well. 

He ended Warm Winter and started his goodbyes and we were all kinda just speechless. Jonghyun started leading us in the ""SHINee"" chant, leading us back to reality. We chanted, waved, he waved, and then was gone. It was done.

**Part 3: Concert as a whole**

Last part. The concert as a whole was just beautiful. It was a journey. Jonghyun is very much into aesthetics and you could tell just from the banners that this concert was going to be both sensual and sexual. It was a beautiful blend of both while showing us a side of Jonghyun that was something we haven't really been shown yet. It was also 15+ for some ""exposure"" but there were a lot of undertones in the performances. The Inspiration VCR and performance literally left me a destroyed mess and I am so excited we're getting a Station release out of this song because his rap. Jonghyun rapping is everything to me. As his him playing the bass. I'm so excited to see the video of the song as well. It's a different side of him and I really enjoy that side???? Like I *really* do.  

I also loved that fact that there was a band. The band made this concert be the way that it was. They were able to make the concert have both the sensual and sexual feel. I'm a sucker for bands and Jonghyun's style is different form SHINee as a whole. ~~Who do I have to talk to for Jonghyun to have a collab with Lee Jonghyun with Kim Jonghyun playing bass? Because this is something the world needs and not just me.~~

Now, Suit Up. Time to tackle this. This was...a destruction of my soul. This VCR right here is one of the reasons the concert was rated 15+. I really can't explain the emotions I went though. I was mostly frustrated because this VCR is literally him teasing us. We're talking clothes being taken off and shower scene. I'm so glad he was wearing a bow tie and not a neck tie because I would have been even more so a mess. I have never been so frustrated over a video in my life yet here I was on Saturday literally covering my mouth the entire time. I think this video literally caused every Blinger in the audience to contemplate their life. I won't be able to recover from this for a while I think. 

Finally, this concert made me think that we are just seeing what Jonghyun can do. He's so artistic. He performed songs from Blue Night and his albums. He thinks very instrumentally and when he speak from the heart, it's like a poetic philosopher. He's someone who thinks deeply and you can tell. His apology over the VCR was right from his heart. He addressed it directly and didn't wait for SM to handle it. While SHINee as a whole literally shines the brightest, Jonghyun has started to make a name for himself outside of his members while always staying true to SHINee [if that makes sense??? No one stans SHINee more than SHINee]. I'm so excited to see what else he can do in the future. This is only just a beginning in my opinion. After this weekend, I pretty much was reconfirmed of my love for Jonghyun. He's just so...words don't do justice. They just simply do not.

Essentially just make random predictions that you think may happen for next year.

My predictions, in no particular order are:

Red Velvet will overtake Twice in popularity

One of these groups will blow up and become a top group: AOA, Sistar, Gugudan or WJSN.

BTS will continue to be the most popular boy group &amp; will release 2 new albums. 

One K-Pop song will reach the Worldwide top 10 charts.

One of these groups will disband: FIESTAR, T-ara or DALSHABET.

TWICE will come out with a subunit with Tzuyu, Sana &amp; Mina. It will have a goofy name like TWICE TZUNAMI.

Those are mi baseless K-POP 2017 predictions, what are yours?

So, I know musical complexity is kind of a fuzzy term, but I guess what I mean by that is, what are some Kpop songs that subvert your expectations musically, or combine genres or musical ideas in an interesting way.

For example, I'm thinking of [Windy Day by Oh My Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJqhKWo89FQ) - how the chorus sounds like a minor key and has a totally different instrumental than the rest of the song.

I did fairly well, but I wish I wasn't right for some of them. My predictions were:

- SNSD-SHY debuts! Full group releases 4th Japan album. **We didn't get SHY or a 4th Japan album, sadly.**

- SNSD Sunny returns to variety yet again, now that shes free from radio. **Lots of Sunny on variety! but it was pretty much all she did this year.**

- 2NE1 returns after CL's US debut (if that ever happens). **Sigh, we were close I guess. At least CL had her debut.**

- Red Velvet releases a ""Velvet"" album of smoother songs, and their popularity continues to explode. **Eyyyy I had a feeling that would happen.**

- 9Muses win a music show. **:( They only had their subunit, but it didn't win anything.**

- Youkyung appears with AOA again, in one form or another. **Well...she was in an article saying she left FNC. Hopefully she still performs with them again.**

- Spica and After School come back pleeease. **Super happy SPICA came back!! ...but After School...**

- Twice will be huge; Lovelyz, G-friend and Oh My Girl continue to get more and more popular. **I think I couldn't be more right here. I knew Twice would be huge, but they're even bigger than I thought.**

- More love for Crayon Pop and Laboum. **Laboum, definitely. Hard to say for Crayon Pop.**

- EXID continues their win streak. **They came back with L.I.E. and got some wins!**

- Rainbow splits up (hopefully not). **Well, shit. I wish I wasn't right about this....**

- Ladies Code releases new music. **They did! Two times! And it's amazing!!**

- Fiestar wins on a music show, after Yezi's new popularity. **They didn't win, but they had their first nomination! Maybe next year.**

- Wonder Girls drop a new album, continuing the band concept. **They did, and it was great, and self-made at that!**

- Block B returns. **They did! I miss their older sound though.**

- Troublemaker releases a 3rd album. **Somehow I don't see this ever happening now, sadly.**

- EXO goes a year without losing a member. **Still under a month left, but I think they're finally stable.**

- Seventeen wins on a music show, not once, but twice. **WOW they won on Show Champion with Pretty U. Not once, but twice.**

- Day6 releases just one album. **I was right here too, but it's time for a comeback, boys.**

- Return of JJ Project as a GOT7 subunit. **No, but I would still love this.**

- SM boy group debuts and does better than iKon. **Hmmm, NCT didn't sell better than iKon by any means, but they were definitely *considerably* more active.**

- Another SuJu member gets married. **No more weddings here yet.**

- SMTown comes to Toronto (I'll post this every year damn it). ***Siiiiiiiiigh.* Well SHINee came, so that's a start. Let's bring the whole gang next time.**

The agency of Kpop idols is something I think about a lot. As an EXID fan, it always strikes people unfamiliar with the Kpop industry as strange that one of their defining features I'll list is that LE writes nearly all of their songs, and works with the rest of the group to cultivate their albums/minis. The concept of someone else choosing nearly everything for you isn't completely unheard of in other countries, but to the extent that it is carried out in Kpop, it seems strange.   
  

I'm curious as to which artists, other than EXID, have had considerable creative agency during their careers. This can manifest itself in a lot of ways- when selecting/creating music for their releases, choosing concepts, styling for performances or MVs, choreographing, etc. ",100,86

Then i went to check a couple k-pop videos just out of curiosity and was surprised to see videos from MAMA and Inkigayo etc. being blocked in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong etc. Do they really want the people to use their own video/streaming platforms this much or do they block them for similar reasons like how a lot of British shows cant be watched in UK and so on as the shows are aired on the local networks? 

I was also confused how for an example, the whole mama performance uploaded BIGBANG from 2015 was not restricted in any way, but their performances uploaded by Mnet were restricted again around Asia. Is this something related to the groups having the rights as its them and their performance or just YGE not giving a damn(understandably)?

664,2016-12-8,2016,12,8,22,5h6x98,[Rumors] TWICE &amp; BLACKPINK may collaborate together on something soon,Calatas,1481204064,"Downvote if you think the evidence isn't good enough, but first read what I have to say.  

First, the 'something' could be anything, including a photoshoot, so don't get your hopes up. I personally believe it's for a Inkigayo special stage at the end of the month.

Nayeon is known as one of the 'spoiler fairies' in the group but it seems like she went too far this time.  

On their last Vlive broadcast, they were talking about their nails.  
[link](http://www.vlive.tv/video/18393/%EB%91%90%EB%B6%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AA%A8) (3:05)  
Momo was afraid it was gonna be a spoiler &amp; said 'but it's so obvious'...  
Nayeon just after that literally says 'black....? hotpink? or red, or things like that'.  
Momo then facepalm hard &amp; dahyun hide her face. Nayeon smile &amp; try to do her own thing.(rewatch it multiple times &amp; look at all of them individually)  

I don't know if I'm reaching here, but I've been laughing at the faces they make for an hour. Imo it's just so obvious.",35,246

&gt; *Have you ever wondered why the booths sponsored by the Korean government at KCONs around the world are so shitty? Wonder no more. One of Choi Soon-sils companies, ostensibly engaged in the business of events planning, was running the KCON and took a large cut of the budget. At KCON France 2016, for example, Chois company received around US $550,000 to operate a booth for introducing Korean food. The booth served cold pastries and hardened rice cakes. Chois company also handled cultural events in Mexico, Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, as well as the events for Korea-ASEAN summit meeting, stealing government budget in the process..*",23,99

I am very optimistic for where kpop is heading in 2017.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

We obviously pretty clueless about what goes on behind the scenes but let's play managers for a second:  

What are some instances you think idols would genuinely do better jumping ship (or even starting their own label)?

Dean wants to thank everyone who came to the show in LA yesterday for all the support!


Dean was supposed to arrive in LA Thursday morning with plenty of time to get some rest and rehearse for the show. For some reason, the immigration personnel in the U.S. city where Dean had a layover on the way to LA detained Dean and refused his entry into the US. Even though Dean has the proper Visa they put him through intense questioning, took his cell phone, took all his luggage, placed him in a holding facility, and were going to deport him to Korea. 
The immigration officials would not give any explanation why Dean was being held and would not let anyone talk to him or see him. His management and label worked frantically to try to understand what was happening and how to get Dean released. Dean and his team kept fighting because Dean wanted to get to LA to perform for his fans. 
Finally, early Friday morning, the day of the show, Dean was released and had just enough time to fly to LA. The doors were opened late because Dean was still rushing to get to the venue. He got to the venue and didn't even have time to do a proper sound check. 
Dean performed not having slept in almost 2 days. Even with everything Dean had been put through he insisted on not canceling the show. He still performed almost all the songs he has released to date for his fans.


Dean would like to thank everyone who helped resolve the misunderstanding. Dean especially wants to thank all his fans for the love and support they showed him. He always appreciates his fans support but it especially meant a lot after what he was put through the two days leading up to the show.

945,2016-12-12,2016,12,12,19,5hvxdf,You somehow gain total control over a group of your choice for the entirety of 2017. Whats your goal + gameplan for the whole year?,thambucheaux,1481538212,"Idk how, blackmail, body-switching... or winning a CEO survival show?

Basically, what would your faves' ideal 2017 be like if you had the opportunity to make it happen?

Groups are still with their agencies. But youre given full rein and backing to the best of the agencys ability + all constraints that come with it - company size, no. of artists, etc.

So if you were in charge in 2017, will you:

*...risk exhaustion and flood the market with an unleashed Winner?*

*...continue Twice's cosplay concepts all the way?*

*...have BTS focus more on variety shows (IC!), or continue their approach?*

*...go on a farewell (for now) tour, or stage multiple comebacks, for Beast, CNBlue, Infinite, and SHINee before enlistments begin in '18?*

*~~...reunite I.O.I in struggling PD101 S2's finale, kicking off a 5-year contract that has them promote each year?~~*

---

Edit:

For example, **BtoB**. Id like them to solidify their current place in 2017.

* Only one comeback mid-year so Sungjae doesnt have to reject scripts again. They'll be pouring in after Goblin.

* Title track by Hyunsik again. He can do whatever he wants. I'd let Ilhoon compose the B-sides too.

* Two sub-units to fill the void: **BtoB Red** *(Dance/Hip-hop)* debuts in the summer and **BtoB Blue** *(Ballad)* returns in the winter.

* Finally, I'd have them make their long overdue Sketchbook debut. Theyre going to knock some socks off for sure.",127,62

&gt; 1. [+610, -36] Taeyong, why..??
&gt; 
&gt; 2. [+534, -37] Why Taeyong..?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. [+477, -52] But isn't it a bit unfair to sue someone when for just spreading what's fact?
&gt; 
&gt; 4. [+68, -5] A bit surprised that the brick is included in the list
&gt; 
&gt; 5. [+60, -7] I really hope that the people who were scammed by that fraud sue him too! So disgusting that he's cosplaying as the victim right now
&gt; 
&gt; 6. [+57, -7] I understand why the other two would sue but why Taeyong  isn't he that auction site scammer?
&gt; 
&gt; 7. [+53, -7] With what right is Taeyong suing with? He's lucky if he doesn't get sued right back 
&gt; 
&gt; 8. [+43, -5] I agree that hate is unwarranted but I do think criticism is something celebrities need to just deal with
&gt; 
&gt; 9. [+42, -7] Taeyong? The scammer?
&gt; 
&gt; 10. [+36, -5] Didn't Taeyong go around leaving hate comments about other people?  Did he forget his past already?


 Daum

&gt; 1. [+602, -82] It's a bit unfair to expect Taeyong to get positive comments though... although I do agree that they should sue for the other two.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. [+531, -41] Isn't that Taeyong kid or whatever the scammer?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. [+329, -33] Taeyong's just reaping what he sowed
&gt; 
&gt; 4. [+276, -21] I'll give it to Chanyeol and Yeri but there's proof for the other guy
&gt; 
&gt; 5. [+244, -21] Taeyong has no right to sue hate commenters when all they're saying is fact. He's such a nuisance being carried by NCT.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. [+163, -16] The other two have every right to sue but Taeyong's past honestly deserves him of the hate
&gt; 
&gt; 7. [+160, -21] What about Tiffany? Or does even SM not see any worth in shielding her?
&gt; 
&gt; 8. [+138, -11] The fact that even kids like Taeyong are demanding no hate comments... ridiculous
&gt; 
&gt; 9. [+81, -13] I mean sure Taeyong deserves hate comments but some take it too far 
&gt; 
&gt; 10. [+43, -19] The problem with hate comments is that it's not just criticism but attacks on who they are as people. Some haters should feel lucky that SM has stayed quiet all this time.

Following the leak of actor Seo Ha Joon's nude video a few days ago, there are multiple celebrities now involved in this scandal. Alleged nude masturbation videos of A-JAX's Hyeongkon, GOT7's Jackson, ASTRO's Eunwoo, Madtown's Jota, Kim Giri, Kim Minseok, Seo Jun Young have leaked. About half of these names had at least the screen caps from their video's posted, confirming their identities. 

EDIT:  The only *actually* leaked videos/pics thus far are of A-JAX's Hyeongkon, Seo Jun Young, Kim Giri, and Kim Minseok. The rest are just claims by the person leaking everything, so take them with a grain of salt. They could very well be tacking on the names of more famous people just to drawn attention.",101,115

For example, the most famous would be, SNSD - Gee, which skyrocketed their popularity and practically was the reason why they are a household name in S.Korea 

I wanna hear everyone's own thoughts on which song(s) from a group/solo that made them popular. Also you can put the song that created a good impression to make you a fan (from that same group) 


I just got a small request for comments, please only put 1 group in your comment, and everyone read the comments so you don't overlap on that. I'm mainly on mobile, so it's just easier to find a comment thread for a particular group than to scroll through a lot of comments. You can comment your agreements/disagreements/thoughts on the original comment of the group if you want to discuss on it",50,27

""Running Man has fallen too far. They tried to avoid a crisis by using their [member] restructuring card, but if anything, it turned into an internal conflict. I think they've lost all the cards in their hand now. Instead of preparing for an immediate [format] reorganization, the first point of order should be to ease the minds of all of the viewers. Otherwise, there may be no choice but to end the show instead of continuing with a Season 2.""

http://news.nate.com/view/20161215n03995?mid=e1100

SM C&amp;C Statement:

Hello this is Kang Ho Dong's agency SM C&amp;C

As was reported yesterday morning, it is true that Kang Ho Dong received an offer to join Running Man Season 2 and after much consideration decided to accept. However, with all the events that have occurred since then, we have realized that Kang Ho Dong's decision to join the show is currently a situation that is very burdensome. We would like to relay our position.

We do not know all of the details of the situations, but we don't want the casting of Kang Ho Dong to inconvenience any of the viewers. With that, we are sorry but we will now politely decline this offer.

To all the fans who love Running Man, and to all of SBS, we apologize for creating confusion and bow our heads in apology. We are sorry.

The thing is that I don't speak Korean or know anybody in Korea, so if you happened to be there and wanted to show me around or just give me tips about how not to die, I would very much appreciate it :)

This is a really good interview and a lot of it reveal their thoughts about the delayed comeback and the impending military. I specially love how they come up with songs though and the love they have about their music. This excerpt stood out to me too:



&gt; 10. BIG BANGs concerts are known to be fun.

&gt;G-DRAGON: The thing is were not good at dancing as a group. Weve tried that when we were rookies. But it wasnt for us, and its not what we want to achieve. In my opinion, theres something that we and our fans like the most. When were doing a concert at a dome or a really big venue, we look so small, almost like fingers, to those at the very back. They have to watch us on the screen. Those who got tickets to limited view seats cant even see the screen. This is why we try to go out as far as we can no matter how tired we are and no matter how crazy we look. This is one of the most important things about our concerts. Of course, our performances have to be great. But the least we can do for our fans is to look them in the eye and say hello. Go up close and sing in front of them. These things will be memorable to our fans. When I was a child, I went to a concert once, and the singer looked me in the eye. He might not think anything of it, but I thought to myself, He looked at me! And, I began to dream about becoming a singer. When you perform, you have to have fun on the stage, but you also have to interact with the audience. Thats communication to me.",2,95

But no year in kpop is ever scandal-free. So here are my top predictions for upcoming scandals in 2017:

**Topp Dogg will sue Cho PD** - this one is already brewing with P Goon recently revealing that the group is owed a large amount of money. With Cho PD's track record with Block B, I don't see things going well for either party in this scenario. 

**Lay to leave Exo** - Boy looks over it. 

**ZE:A finally officially disbands** - they're better off on their own anyway.

**Zico gets into a scandal that seriously threatens his career** - Zico always seems to be putting his foot in his mouth or making poor decisions that catch up with him. They've been relatively minor so far but I think there's going to be a much larger scandal for him to deal with in 2017.

**SHINee has a dating scandal** SHINee has always remained relatively scandal free but I think 2017 will be a year of dating stories for them. Mino and possibly Taemin will be revealed to be in relationships. A bit of drama at first but it dies down and doesn't effect the overall success of the group. 

**CL returns to Korea** near the end of 2017 after failing to crack the American market. YG will be criticized for yet another failed attempt at making it in the US. 

**Seungri will continue to deliver** while Big Bang is on hiatus, Seungri will get involved in yet another scandal relating to women. ",43,0

For example, at first the only name I knew from TWICE was Tzuyu, and that was due to the Taiwanese flag incident. As I caught up on the sixteen program and their private life show, I grew to know and sympathize each member, memorizing their names/faces by heart. Today, I am a proud TWICE supporter. 

Some may not realize this, but for the first 3-4 years BIGBANG and SNSD made variety appearances everywhere, to the point where bigbang did multiple drama parodies and Daesung was a key permanent member of Family Outing. I believe this helped both groups to reach the elite status they are at today. 

P.S. I am not anti-YG. I support BIGBANG and am a huge fan of Blackpink.",47,54

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

1512,2016-12-19,2016,12,19,14,5j4qur,Girl Group Rapper Rankings: 2016 Edition,Tery_,1482125719,"Hey r/kpop! As we wind down 2016 (pls I can't deal anymore), I wanted to start previewing 2017 with new **Girl Group Rapper Power Rankings**! Of course, these are my own rankings based on my observations / opinions throughout the year - and will be the 3rd installment since I started doing these for my blog in early 2014 (which may make for an awkward read at times, like positiong changes) - but! I wanted to generate discussion about rappers. Find out who seems to be the crowd favorite, who is to watch out for, songs i may have missed / overlooked, etc. etc. My rankings are primarily based on rap ability, rap quality, and consistency / resume. And title tracks / official releases (I didn't want to work on this for the next 200 years). Warning: it's really lengthy because I ranked 32 rappers... Now as far as I know there's no way to have a dropdown-like thing to save space but I'm going to try using the tables (which I've never used before).

Rank | Name | +/- | Details
-----|-----|-----|--------------------
#32 | Junyeol | -- | Welcome to the series, Junyeol. You're going to have to be seated here though. Stellar's songs tend to have brief rap segments, which isn't the best opportunity to show us what Junyeol can do. Furthermore, most of her raps have been more of the rap-singing mix, and as far as I can tell there isn't a single time where she's been average even doing that. Stellar as a group is hanging on by a thread, and it won't be the rapping that gets them extra attention anytime soon.
#31 | Dahye | -8 | Looking back, I'm not exactly sure who or why I placed Dahye above a handful of other rappers last time. She's got a pretty good voice for rapping, sure, but when it comes down to it most of her material is very brief and unimpressive overall. She isn't blowing you away, and hardly gets the opportunity to in the first place. Compounding this is the fact that BESTie has been quiet since ""Excuse Me,"" with only Uji getting any exposure (that I know of) elsewhere.
#30 | Dahyun | -- | I've previously mentioned that Dahyun reminds me of a certain Hyelim from Wonder Girls. That is to say, she's definitely alright if she has Lim vibes, and certainly respectable given she's a rookie. However, Dahyn's progress will be tough thanks to two things: the first is that she and Chaeyoung will (more than likely) continue to share the raps in Twice, and the second being that because she is like Hyelim, I don't think her ceiling is very high. Dahyun is so young though that she can only go up.
#29 | Chaeyoung | -- | While I consider Chaeyoung to be considerably more gifted than Dahyun, she can't really go much higher on the list for most of the same reasons. Splitting raps for line distribution is nice, but not so nice if you want to establish yourself as a new rapper to watch. We've seen her rap a little outside of her group, and she has serious potential if not restricted to rap-singing in pop songs. But whether or not she'll get that opportunity later remains to be seen.
#28 | Irene | -2 | Red Velvet may have had two comebacks this year, but neither ""One Of These Nights"" or ""Russian Roulette"" featured any rapping, which is good or bad depending on what you want. If you wanted to have songs without any weak points, great! If you wanted to see Irene potentially improve as a rapper, not so great. So with that said, it's difficult to evaluate her without new material, but I think her current position is about right.
#27 | Sojin | -- | Sojin's placement is shaky to begin with, as the future of 9MUSES is always in question, no matter what the current roster looks like. When their new subunit was announced, most presumed she'd be the awkward filler position. Then we were treated to a pretty decent rap sequence, which was a surprise. With one decent rap under her belt already, she escapes the bottom five for now, but the uncertainty of her group's future will remain looming over her head.
#26 | Yura | -2 | Remember the last time Girl's Day had a comeback? Pepperidge Farm remembers. Seriously, their last comeback was almost a year and a half ago. Prior to the extended hiatus from promoting, she was showing promise with solid raps in ""I Miss You"" and ""Ring My Bell,"" albeit the latter being criminally short. That's the other thing with Yura. Many of her raps are simply too short to assess. Please let them release new music soon, I'm getting desperate.
#25 | Serri | -- | With so many rappers, there's bound to be people who are overlooked or not as deeply researched. Serri has flirted on and off with rapping responsibilities, even during the time that Gaeun officially had the rapping position. We got a great first look (or perhaps a reminder) of her ability when she highlighted ""Someone Like U"" with a rap that was on repeat for a good few months. However, their latest comeback wasn't anything special, and also lacked clear rapping.
#24 | Chanmi | -- | AOA Cream was the best thing to happen for Chanmi, even though she essentially got ""the Bora treatment."" That being: a rapping section only (and dance and face time, naturally). Still, she definitely made the most out of what she got and delivered a solid (if not monotonous) rap break which was refreshing compared to the sugary sweet vocals from Yuna and Hyejeong. What ""I'm Jelly Baby"" showed is that the potential for Chanmi is there, but likely something to be seen only in AOA Cream promotions.
#23 | Hyoyeon | -3 | To be fair to Hyoyeon, she was never known for being a rapper but instead a dancer. Despite lightly dabbing in rap over the last few years, I didn't expect her to rap in her solo track with Station. ""Mystery"" followed a trend that most of the girl group soloists have shared: decent / good songs with underwhelming choruses or breaks. That actually hurts her more than the others because her rap was poor. It wasn't even ten seconds and sounded messy as hell. Would've been much better if it was a full-fledged dance break instead.
#22 | Hyelim | -- | Hyelim makes a return to Rapper Power Rankings after missing out last year's revisions. She's gotten in some more work since we last saw her: rapping in ""With You"" with Bernard Park and joining Yubin for ""Why So Lonely,"" too. Like I said with Dahyun, she's decent, but by now I think she's reached her limit. She will always be close-to-serviceable, which is fine! But it sure is tough being in a group with Yubin since Yubin is so good.
#21 | Newsun | -- | Newsun and Sonamoo showed much promise upon debut, rocking that aggressive performance style. That fell by the wayside, as subsequent releases have been very much bubblegum pop and not at all aggressive. ""I Like U Too Much"" featured an unfortunate rap by her, but again I can't fully blame her for it. I blame the damn cutesy motif. I still see resemblances between Newsun and Jucy of EvoL fame(?), but she and D.ana will forever be chained down by their group's (indecisive) themes.
#20 | Sihyun | +2 | Here's where I consider the rappers to be serviceable at worst. Not a knock on Sihyun, because she has it tough in particular, being in a vocal powerhouse group like SPICA. More unfortunately, while their latest comeback ""Secret Time"" was awesome, there was no rapping to be had. Still, her past works speak for themselves. I would consider her the reverse Moonbyul (sort of): a great singer that happens to be alright on the mic.
#19 | Exy | -- | If Dahyun gives me Hyelim vibes, then Exy gives me Yubin vibes, but not to the same extent. She sounds like a younger, more nasally Yubin, which at the end of the day is still a relatively pleasing voice to listen to. Even though she is in a gigantic group, she gets plenty of opportunities in the spotlight. Her rap in ""Secret"" was one of the best of this year, although it agonizes all Bora fans because if Exy can get a 15 second rap in a group of 13, how is it that Bora gets half of that in a group of four? But I digress.
#18 | Yeeun | -- | As we roll further into a string of newbies, I'd like to explain why most of these girls are where they are. Some of these rookies have been very impressive out the gate, no question. But a batting average of 1.000 isn't very meaningful with only 10 at bats. What I mean is that they have to have more songs under their belt before better / more accurate judgments can take place. They have plenty of time to improve. Anyway, Yeeun has a flighty rapping style befitting her group and did a great job with ""Pepe"" and ""No Oh Oh."" It'll be interesting to see if CLC ever changes up their style and how Yeeun's raps will adapt.
#17 | Jennie | -- | Jennie is special because she had two excellent debut raps. Of course that's because she got to debut with ""Whistle"" and ""Boombayah"" but hey the raps still had to be good to mean anything. Her rapping in ""Boombayah"" was more impressive though I liked the laid-back style in ""Whistle"" more. She's got a great voice that works well for both rapping and singing, and as previously mentioned she'll be a wonderful component of Black Pink because she can do it all.
#16 | Lisa | -- | Another pair of rappers from the same group find themselves side by side. This is eerily reminiscent of the first list back in early 2014. Anyway, Lisa is ranked directly above Jennie if only for the fact that she got a solo rap in ""Playing With Fire"" (and Jennie did not). Both of them are pretty similar, but where Jennie has a voice advantage, Lisa has the charisma advantage. She's the next CL in terms of her energy and I love watching her perform live.
#15 | D.ana | -1 | What could have been. *What could have been*. D.ana's powerful voice (the likes of which could only be contested by Yubin) has been squandered away in recent Sonamoo songs. In ""I Like U Too Much,"" she was relegated to brief rap-singing which is simply a waste of her talent. At least ""Cushion"" still had her despite all the cringeworthy English usage. I'm willing to bet that if Sonamoo stayed with their debut style for at least another comeback I'd be down with putting her close to the top 10.
#14 | Lime | +4 | Don't be misled by Lime's surge to #14. Even though Hello Venus had ""Glow"" and ""Paradise"" this year, neither release has any rapping to speak of, which means she's been exactly the same since ""I'm Ill."" To be more politically correct, she hasn't had new material since ""Wiggle Wiggle."" It seems rap-singing has been more of the rage for some of our veterans. Hello Venus need to work with Brave Brothers again to get some of Lime's swagger back. In hindsight I think D.ana deserved to stay at #14 from last year because she at least got some form of rapping in.
#13 | Mimi | -- | Following what I said about rookie placement, the best newcomer is the one with the most good (or better) raps, and that distinction has to go to Mimi. Mimi is the proud owner of three excellent raps: ""Closer"" was an underrated rap section of last year, while ""Liar Liar"" and ""A-ing"" are only worth listening to (for me) because of Mimi's performance. The ""A-ing"" rap in particular is probably my favorite because it shows off her pizzazz. All of the new girl group rappers have potential, but the one I'm looking forward to the most is Mimi.
#12 | Hana | +3 | Secret has been in limbo ever since summer of 2014, so unlike other rappers who have at least been releasing new music, Hana has nothing to speak of. Now that Sunhwa is no longer you would expect TS Entertainment to do something but nope. Granted it was only in October that their contracts expired, but the fact that Hana remained with the label says something, at least I hope it does. Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure she belongs at #12 after such an extended time.
#11 | Hyomin | +1 | Hyomin has been rather quiet on the rapping front. Her solo comeback with ""Sketch"" and T-ARA's ""Tiamo"" have both lacked rapping, so in the same way that others in her range (Hana and Lime specifically) rise a little so too will she. Of course, with no new raps to speak of there's nothing else to talk about. Inactivity and not receiving any raps are basically synonymous, and she'll quickly be overtaken by the rising stars despite having a consistent history in her raps.
#10 | Nada | +9 | Nada experiences a massive jump up the standings thanks to her berth and success on Unpretty Rapstar. The exposure was a much-needed jolt of life considering how inactive Wassup have been. Throw in her mixtape and she has plenty to add to her otherwise boring resume. Nada's definitely got a swagger and ferociousness that is uncommon in other rappers, and her rare lower voice makes her stand out even more. If Wassup could start gaining traction, she'll be the centerpiece of it, much like Yezi was with FIESTAR.
#9 | Hyeran | -- | I'm not entirely confident placing Hyeran here as a newcomer to the rankings. At the same time, who else is truly deserving of being in the top 10 besides her? After Nada, she has the next fewest amount of great material, but conversely has impressed me in older variants of Brave Girls (like ""Nowadays You""). With her group's revival came ""Deepened"" and 2016's best girl group rap break. Since then however, her parts in ""High Heels"" and ""Yoohoo"" haven't been as good, plus her and her group's future is once again in question.
#8 | Jimin | +4 | It's the motherfucking top madam, y'all. With so many departures like CL and Jia, Jimin naturally finds herself moving up the list. Like before, Jimin's talent is undeniable but her voice is very much hit or miss. This year was rather unkind to her (and everyone else) with AOA being swept up in controversy, and on top of that Jimin's solo debut ""Call You Bae"" and AOA's ""Good Luck"" had underwhelming rap sequences. Still, you can't ignore the super strong 2014 and as previously mentioned, the rookies will have their chance to upset later.
#7 | Amber | +1 | Since the fantastic ""4 Walls,"" we've seen some more of Amber's rapping talent being utilized. All of her rapping this year was through Station, as ""All Mine"" featured a cheerful rap alongside her groupmates while ""Borders"" was something special. ""Borders"" headlined the first of a few new solo tracks that were all about Amber's emotional softer side. Subsequent tracks were more about her development as a singer (and I loved them all), but regardless she will remain comfortably in the top 10.
#6 | Bora | +3 | Bora and Sistar were pretty quiet this year, with most of the attention being turned towards Hyorin and her solo comeback. However, let's not forget that Sistar needed to bounce back from a mediocre ""Touch My Body"" and ""Shake It."" And they did in spades with ""I Like That."" The thing is, Bora had decent raps in the last two years and while the rap in ""I Like That"" was good, it was criminally short. The same could be said for her late appearance in ""One More Day."" By the next comeback, I think it'll be easier for me to pick between Bora and Amber.
#5 | Moonbyul | +2 | Boasting the 2nd highest rapping profile in 2016, Moonbyul makes her way into the top 5 after the departures of CL and Erin. Not only did she have plenty of material this year, but most of Mamamoo's new songs featured double raps from Moonbyul, further gracing us all with her gifts. From the hilarious roasts of ""Taller Than You"" to the emphatic lines in ""Decalcomanie,"" Moonbyul put in *work* this year and it shows. It's amazing to see her excel in a group so focused on vocals (not to mention not getting any singing chances herself).
#4 | Miryo | -- | Even without releasing anything in 2016, it would be so disrespectful of me to not keep Miryo in the top 5.  Brown Eyed Girls quietly celebrated their 10th year together, which is a level of longevity that other girl groups would die to have (in fact many of them are dying because they don't have it). With a slew of Unpretty Rapstar releases and the ""Rock-Scissors-Paper"" collab with Giant Pink, Miryo has once again added consistent performances to her resume.
#3 | Yezi | +2 | After breaking out last year on Unpretty Rapstar, no other girl group rapper had a better year than Yezi. FIESTAR comebacks? Check. Solo mini album? Check. Excellent rapping across all of these efforts? Check. Her (group's) songs thrive on her rapping and vice versa, and I don't think she's close to her max potential yet. If rapping could kill, Yezi would be a dangerous girl. I almost put her one spot higher, but the consistency and history of the #2 member deserved it more.
#2 | Yubin | +1 | Many girl group rappers have walked through the doors of Unpretty Rapstar, but I'd wager that two names didn't need the show to reaffirm their skills. Miryo is one name, Yubin is the other. Yubin had a succinct year, delivering a lengthy rap break in ""Why So Lonely,"" which is my #2 pick for girl group rap of the year behind Hyeran in ""Deepened."" Yubin is a model of consistency, and with Wonder Girls enjoying a new breath of life late in their careers, I can only see Yubin continue to make strides in her rapping abilities.
#1 | LE | -- | To nobody's surprise, LE defends her #1 spot thanks to a successful rebound in 2016. After the disappointing showing in ""Hot Pink,"" she returned to form with a killer rap in ""L.I.E"" Her combination of voice, consistency, and history / resume make her a difficult rapper to get overtaken by, especially with EXID continuing to gain momentum. After Yezi's solo promotions this year I'm hoping LE will have a chance to do the same eventually. LE is the gold standard and should continue to prove it as EXID prepare to advance into the Chinese market.

In my opinion, I think DIA has the best chance. Though, they aren't very popular on this sub, their album sales have tripled in the past year, and they have a pretty loyal Korean fanbase. Chaeyeon and Cathy's popularity also helps. They're also having their first concert this week and are releasing a group 3-part drama. The way MBK has been marketing them is very reminiscent to T-ARA back in the day.

WJSN and gugudan are in the same boat as well. Gugudan especially considering Sejeong. ",185,121

1706,2016-12-22,2016,12,22,0,5jkbht,[Discussion] What is your favorite MV concept and why?,brohammerhead,1482332416,"You can answer with overall concept or specific concepts.

My picks: 

**Big Bang** - [We Like 2 Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFmfi1vM7co): I appreciate the high production value, studio filmed MVs as much as the next girl but I love this MV so much because it *isn't* overly produced. They are filming themselves not as Big Bang but as 5 giant children hanging out with their friends and it matches the light-hearted theme and sound of the song perfectly.

**BTS** - [Save Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso): Again, not a studio video and it's precisely why I love this video. The stormy atmosphere adds to the emotion of this song while letting it shine. Sometimes music videos can distract from the song but this MV highlights the song without losing the viewer's attention.

**2NE1** - [Come Back Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLbfv-AAyvQ): I am LIVING for the futuristic world and fashion that they created for this video. The graphics in this MV are so detailed and I never get tired of watching them. Most of all I appreciate the plausible storyline. 

**Mamamoo** - [Piano Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IIBVnn4eTM): Sometimes groups will have MVs that don't match the song which is NOT the case for this MV. The retro vibe and the storyline fit the song so well. I also love the color cutout concept as it makes this video that much more unique.",82,59

So as the title states what happened this year that really upset you. For me I have to say Running Man, the show has been on for so long and was like my favorite for quite a while but then it went further and further downhill because of the repetitiveness and now finally the show is coming to close, Gary left, Jihyo and Jongkook getting the boot.  It ain't kpop really but it falls under the category. Also have there been any good news and also any bad news that no one really mentioned?",30,11

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

My top 6 are:

1. Jay Park: Me Like Yuh - Loved the tropical beat it had. Took me a long time to check out this song because to be honest, some of his other music wasn't really my type but after seeing this at 1 Million Dance Studio, I've been replaying this over and over again.

2. K.A.R.D: Oh Nana - Quickly became one of my favorite groups even though they only have one song.

3. EXO: Monster - The choreography in this alone was enough for me to love it. Was my favorite song for a long time before I heard Jay Park

4. Blackpink: Boombayah and Stay - As a person who is pretty new to Kpop, this group is the first girl group I really got into. Both these songs are really good, although Boombayah's bird calling is a bit offputting. I think 'Stay' is really underrated and deserves more views. Check it out if you haven't heard it yet. 

5. 4Minute: Hate - This song has been pretty divisive. I actually didn't like the song at all when I first heard it but it grew on me over time. The grey contacts in the MV look amazing as well.

6. BTS: Blood, Sweat and Tears - BTS is the first Kpop group I ever really followed. (I found about them with Dope if you cared). The MV for this tune was stunning, even though I had no idea what was going on. JHope killed it.

I've been making a collection of great k-pop mashups and remixes lately. It's hard to dig through youtube because there is a lot of low quality stuff. I thought it'd be easier to ask you all for your favorite remixes or mashups :) Any are welcome! I'm using them to improve my weight lifting playlist so upbeat stuff is great!

It's also just kind of fun to share with everyone :) One of my fave channels I've found so far is https://www.youtube.com/user/ahndhante good stuff there! And Aereia remixes are great as well :)",19,8

2210,2016-12-27,2016,12,27,10,5kh2jr,Favorite deep track of 2016?,brohammerhead,1482802967,"Clarification: By deep track I mean songs that were on the albums but were not promoted as singles or have music videos. Songs that the general public wouldn't know. A.K.A - B side.

Mine would have to be (in no particular order):

* [Pricked - Mino &amp; Taehyun (Winner)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knyUO0He_B0) - This song is heartbreakingly beautiful. So simple but so meaningful. My Korean is rusty at best but I can't help but sing along every time.
* [Lie - Jimin (BTS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbvTsN2P4SY) - Though RM is my bias Jimin's song HAD ME. The instrumentals are brilliant and I think this song showcases how much she has improved.
* [The Moon - Yezi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPMWJFHjvT0) - I wish this song was a single even though the MV for SSE SSE SSE was excellent. It's just so badass.
* [Word Don't Come Easy - Mamamoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc2bfEYNY7w) - Slowed down Mamamoo shows off their harmonies. This song is so dreamy yet relatable.
* [Do It! - HyunA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Jjhtyhq1o) - Took a bit for this song to grow on me but once it did, she had me. HyunA is a bitch so be cautious.
* [Blind - 4minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxGTFu5oEM) - This song would have done so well if it were promoted I think. It's so moving and emotional.
* [Moon - Jonghyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8iB877oXjM) - WHY ISN'T IT LONGER. I love this song and Jjong but I am a little bitter that he teased me with this short masterpiece.
* [Guess Who - Taemin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjsn5wscdJQ) - Lee Taemin did it again. The funky guitar just makes you want to move. I would have loved to seen an MV for this.
* [I Guess I Need U - B.A.P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUUMsmahRyg) - Such a thirsty song but in a great way not a cringey way. Smooth R&amp;B sound paired with Dae's crazy high voice are a perfect combo. 
* [Will You Take Me? - EXID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwY48e0gFpk) - IMHO this is a completely different sound from them. The slowed down ballad over simple drums and guitar is a perfect and gentle segueway into an excellent album.",96,67

2233,2016-12-27,2016,12,27,14,5ki139,Why do some girl groups have more female fans than other girl groups?,dankychanmi,1482815960,"For example SM girl groups tend to have a much higher percentage of female fans than girl groups from other companies (of course there are exceptions though). Red Velvet and Blackpink seem to have many female fans compared to groups such as Twice, AOA or IOI. Why do you think that is and do you think girl groups can reap all the benefits of female fans compared to boy groups.

I'm interested to hear the reasons of others because I always thought that in order to get a girl group to have many female fans they have to pick girls that look cute but not overly cute with a look that is almost obtainable? (for a lack of better words). The girls have to look like the prettiest girls in the school that everyone admires. Also, the concepts don't necessarily have to be cute (ie Blackpink) but they can be (ie. Red Velvet). But that's just my opinion.

(no shitposting pls, just because a group has more female fans than another doesn't make them better)",77,39

I'd like to briefly bring something to your attention.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in March this year, a friend recommended a Korean music website to me. The site let its users collaborate on a 24/7 stream of K-Pop, hip hop, r&amp;b and a whole host of other genres, working in a similar way to [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/), [turntable.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntable.fm) and [Dubtrack](https://www.dubtrack.fm/). People would queue up to play Korean tracks straight from YouTube and SoundCloud, exposing me to songs and artists that I never would have found otherwise.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm now volunteering some of my spare time to help out there. It's an incredible piece of software built by music lovers _for_ music lovers - the developers have created this site, [Wave](https://welovekpop.club/), without being paid for their work, instead wanting to give listeners a way to share and discuss Korean music for free. What the site is missing is users.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd love to see more people using Wave, so this post is my attempt to get the word out. I've helped plan a pretty varied [schedule of events](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwave/comments/53vls1/the_we_kpop_event_schedule_september_2016_january/) on Wave to keep things looking lively - the next event is one that I've been excited for since I wrote that schedule. Tomorrow (December 29), we'll be recapping our favourite songs of the year in the 'Best of 2016' event - it would be awesome if you could join us to check out the site and share some of this year's best musical moments.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for reading! \^-^

[this tweet](https://twitter.com/kepiko/status/814890769118961664) (and other tweets on twitter seem to confirm it) says the caption's translation is:

""It's so hard. I'm fed up. I don't think I can do it on my own anymore. It's been a mistake since 9 years ago. Now that place has become so big, it seems it can't support (me?) anymore. What should I do from now on?""

apparently he also commented on the image:

""Now it seems my fans are all I have. If you see this post, please talk for me. Our agency won't listen to me""

He's a super talented musician/artist obviously and this makes me feel really bad for him even though I wouldn't expect SJ-M to be promoting at all because half the members are enlisted. i feel like SM has been doing a better job of promoting their artists (esp w everyone who got in on station) but you never know what goes on behind the scenes...
