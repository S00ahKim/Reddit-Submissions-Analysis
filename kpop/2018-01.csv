Thought it'd be interesting to see everyone's picks. (Plus I'm hoping to find some hidden gems I missed throughout the year.)

For me:

**Song - SEVENTEEN's Change Up/Kim Lip's Eclipse** *I couldn't pick between the two!*

**Album - DAY6's Sunrise** *Had the hardest time deciding this category because I thought there were so many amazing albums this year.*

**Artist - BTS** *This one was between either BTS or IU for me because I think she absolutely owned this year. But I think the growth I've seen from BTS and what they've done/achieved for not only themselves this year, but for Kpop as a whole, they definitely deserve this spot. This coming from a non-Army. Really looking forward to what they do next.*

**Honorable mentions:**

**Songs:**

* Seo In Guk - BeBe

* Brave Girls - Rollin'

* Hyuna - BABE

* CLC - Call My Name

* Laboum - Hwi Hwi

* Loona - Sweet Crazy Love

* Astro - Crazy Sexy Cool

* Red Velvet - Peek-A-Boo

* KARD - Into You

* Melomance - Gift

**Albums:**

* NCT 127 - Limitless

* Bobby - Love And Fall

* MONSTA X - The Clan part 2.5

* Royal Pirates - Hasta la Vista

* Bolbbalgan4 - Red Diary page 1

**Artists:**

* Everything IU this year, especially  (Through the Night) *   (Ending Scene). That Palette album was a masterpiece.

* Red Velvet *Releasing bops left and right.*

* MONSTA X *Both their albums this year were amazing.*

DO NOTE: I'm not here wanting to encourage hate against other groups, just wanting to see realisitic predictions to what might happen. I do however encourage the usage of statistics to prove your point!

Here is my prediction: 
CLC
I'm a proud Cheshire, but even I have to admit, CLC might not exist after 2018. Let's face it, CUBE entertainment (The company that manages CLC) is known to make brash decision. From their managing, they lost both 4Minute and BEAST. What makes them think that they won't disband CLC? Another factor is small sales. Correct me if I am wrong but I believe either Hobgoblin or FREE'SM was their most sold album, but sales numbers was still tiny. However, anything can happen and who knows what, CLC and CUBE Entertainment could make a comeback and turn CLC into an iconic group. I hope they don't, as they are one of the few girl groups that can pulloff any concept.

What this means is for cases where a single story had lots of high-voted submissions, e.g. T.O.P and Jonghyun, only the highest-upvoted submission related to that story is kept.

### Thank You

Happy End of 2017 and Happy 2018 to you all! Thank you all for the content you provide: the articles and releases you post, the reports you file, the upvotes you dish out, the comments you downvote only because they're off-topic (pls), the all-caps exclamations, the passionate discussions, the translations you fake with Google Translate hoping the mods wont notice but we totally do, the love you share, the memes you shitpost, and so much more. Through the celebrations and the hardships, this community does a genuinely exceptional job of coming together and supporting each other over the shared love of this ~~fanatic obsession~~ genre we all know and love. 

As always, if you have any questions, comments, or insults, we're always just a modmail away. We love the feedback and really love seeing the way this sub changes and evolves over time. 2017 was there year of ""Features"" on r/kpop: from artist spotlights, to the Jukebox, to Top 10 Tuesdays, to Two Week Laters, to Throwback Thursdays, to all the others I'm missing. Thank you to those donating that time and effort to putting that type of content together; we want to emphasize that it really is appreciated and the sub is a much better place because of it. 

It is truly a pleasure to get to serve this community each and every day. To those of you new to the subreddit this year: welcome! To those of you who have been here since the beginning: welcome back! We're excited to see what 2018 has in store and can't wait to share those wonderful moments with you all. 

Thank you, all. Happy 2018!

\- The Modteam

Mine would be (in order)

2. Oh My Girl to make it big. Last year was such an awful one for the group. Really sad it will be without JinE but hoping this comeback will change their fortunes. They have such huge talent I just hope it finally gets rewarded. 

3. The return of upbeat dance Taeyeon. I loved her Why mini album so much. I would love something similar from her this year.",314,210

* Do not rank them in reverse order.

*  #1 get 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, #3 get 8 points etc.

* Upvoting/Downvoting someone else's ranking won't affect the results. 

* Groups, subunits and solo artists are considered separate.

* If a group/subunit/artist has released 2-9 songs and you want to see /r/kpop rank them you can put that group in your top ten.

* If a temporary group gets enough points to be featured in /r/kpop's Top Ten Tuesday, their top ten will be pushed back until 1 month after they disband. 


Schedule:

January 9th: Music Videos of 2017

January 16th: Albums of 2017

January 23rd: Side Tracks of 2017

January 30th: Singles/Title Tracks of 2017  

I'll be going by what Melon lists has a title track for the top ten side tracks of 2017 and the top ten singles/title tracks of 2017. The Top Tens of 2017 will be limited to Korean language music and music made by Korean artists, Japanese/Chinese/English releases by Korean artists will be eligible.

I asked users to vote on how much time should pass before a re-do is allowed. As a result, it was decided that 18 months must pass before a re-do (I'll go into more detail in the comments). Which means that there will be no re-dos in 2018

**Oh and I SHOOK HANDS WITH KEI AND SUJENG AND HIGH-FIVED JIAE TOO!**

BOLDED because bragging about it feels so good.
***
* Hi, I used to be a ~~lurker on~~ Reddit addict who has finished (of Nov 2017) end of mandatory 2 year service in the Airforce base in Gwangju, who just randomly wanted share my experience with how various K-pop groups/solos are viewed in army.



* Do NOT take my words here to be representative of whole Korean and/or soldiers here though, things may or may not be different in army/navy and in different bases.

* [NOT going to answer politic-related stuff.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y19nnz8M0_Q/VEeRqT4_oMI/AAAAAAAAAOU/Q_5-lvRpjHg/s1600/how%2Babout%2Bno.jpg) You'll have find a different guy for that.

***
**Some stuff I want to clear**
***


* Before I got into service, I had little interest in K-pop or even music in general (usually listened to some recent popular rock). BUT after I joined I became crazy interested in various girl groups. (common case for many)

* I have lived in US for couple of years, so while I can write/read English, I might make some mistakes. ~~[Deal with it](http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Owl-Deal-With-It.gif)~~ and would be happy to fix any typo or grammar mistakes if you point them out.

* My personal favorite groups are Gfriend (Yerin esp) and Lovelyz (Kei esp). Recently liking Dreamcatcher (Jiu esp)and Oh My Girl(Yooa esp) too. Getting into soloists like Sunmi, Chungha and Sohee too! And I have been doing some Vlive subs too! (mostly Dreamcatcher though my friends in Owl Sub [twitter link](https://twitter.com/OwlSubs)  [vlive link](http://subtitle.vlive.tv/team/Team161)  )

* Most liked to listen songs are Rough(Gfriend) Now We (Lovelyz) Fly High (Dreamcatcher) 

***
**How we Korean soliders react to K-pop**
***

* Mostly through TV (has internet-cable) that is in each room(dormitory?), we usually watch Music shows such as Music Bank/Show Champion/M Countdown and variety shows. Rewatching good live performances and shows with girl singers in them is common.

* A lot listen to K-pop with MP3 (which is allowed as long as in Air Force if it does not have any wireless connection) and using computer service (we can use it after 'work time' is over for free, though it is limited to 2 hours at once)

* Some buy music from legal sources but many just pirate it. Very few buy physical album.

* Not much of merch bought, but some do buy posters and calendars. (I was responsible for bringing a lot of Maxim posters -often sexy kpop idols- around base.)

* Most do not take part in official fandom(s), and are light fans of multifandom. Males tend to be like that.

* Want to specify we have to serve our service in 20s, and most choose to go early to get it done with. So 'creepy old man perving on young girls' stereotype is off. (Heck a lot of times we are cheering 'We love you noona!')

***
**The popularity rank among soliders** I made from general opinion - Will add more


(Inactive/disbanded groups (ex: After School, BEG, 2NE1) are not in the list to keep it from getting too messy), and it is likely that they are interest about such groups in military when there are so many attractive active girls. (Yes this includes legendary groups like ex-trinity gg SNSD, Wonder Girls, Kara too)

***
**Nation's GG**
***

**Twice**

- The unmatched girl group of present days. Or as some like to say, the Nation's Girl Group.

- 'Debate' over who is best member is common. Most rooting for Sana/Momo/Tzuyu.

- People do know they are not that talented in terms of singing or dancing, but they are very effective with doing enough to follow/copy and like.

***
**Elite Four**
***

**Red Velvet**

- Had been out and in of S rank depending on the last song.

- But their company, SM is rich and pushing them hard with power of money well since Red Room.


**Gfriend**

- Pure/cute concept on stage, but very beagle-like (outward, comedic, playful etc). The contrast is very charming to a lot of people.

- Is considered 'rival' of Twice often. Mostly due to contrasting images. (Gfriend having Korean lyrics mostly, 80/90s feeling Vs Twice being Western slangs, modern feeling)


**Blackpink**

- Company and selling power is S rank worthy but fandom is too weak yet. Mostly thanks to YG not showing them anywhere.


**Mamamooo**

- Liked widely with only few haters. Their talented singing ability and quirky personalities made even those usually uninterested in girlgroups like them.


***
**Veterans Still Strong**
***

**Apink**

- Good songs+Known Well+ Strong Fandom. Even if they are weaker then they used to be, still tough for 7 year old group

- Members' variety and drama appearance most get praises and keeps the public liking them too.


**Girl's Day**

- Had being out of game too long, but is still widely known and selling well with recent return.

- Hyeri is still a CF queen too.

**EXID**

- Really popular thanks to truly strong sexy concept, but this also makes them target of some haters.

- Sells well and is known well. But fandom size is small compared to their popularity with public.

- Lack of Solji voice is taking toll though, hope she could comeback soon.


**AOA**

- Seolhyun is all over the country with all kind of advertisements.

- Not sure what Choa's department means for the group, she was such iconic voice and was reponsible for keeping fans entertained.

***
**Gatekeeper between 'popular' and 'not really'**
***

**Lovelyz**

- Nicknamed 'The Gatekeeper' for not being strong enough to be solidly on A rank but is far stronger compared to B ranks.

- Album sells quite well now thanks to getting a win to get a public attention.

- Fandom has lots of 30+ and older fans with strong loyalty, so they are good at buying stuff but weak when it comes to votes and such.


***
**Just a bit more for 1st win and recognization..**
***


**Oh My Girl**


- Many agree they have potential to be A or even S rank, with right push.

- Seems to be casually liked by many, including other fandoms(because a lot of idols like OMG, their fans give attention to OMG), but doesnt really translate to strong fandom.

- YooA is one of variety chip idol, shown a lot in various shows and make public interested in her and her group.

- Coloring Book had mixed receptions. JinE unable to comeback and long hiatus killed momentum a bit sadly.


**Cosmic Girls**

- Cheng Xiao being variety chip and Yeung Jung addition boost them some much needed popularity boost.

- Mixed feelings and opinions losing Secret and I Wish 'spacy' concept and going for more Cheerleader-vibe Happy and Kiss Me though.


**Pristin**

- Had a solid start, properly carried produce 101 hype with some TV variety appearances and mini concerts.

- Nayoung and Kyulkyung very popular, both to male and female.

- But title songs had very mixed receptions.

***
**Couple good push from being big**
***

**Laboum**

- Solbin carried the team hard and is selling well. Quite popular among soldiers because they often come do military-related events. They came to our base too!

- Unfortunately Sajegi incident + Wolhee dating scandal/leaving have taking toll to the group.


**Weki Meki**

- Yoojung+Doyeon being very popular duo helps team a lot.

- But questionable title song/concept has mixed opinions.


**Gugudan**

- Again, Post IOI members, Sejoung and Mina's popularity carrying group hard.

- Weird concepts has been hit or miss.


**Nine Muses**

- Being sexy noona makes them very liked within military.

- Kyungri is popular after hilarious appearances at God of Music 2

- Unfortunately after God of Music 2 hype, nothing really to carry that hype.


**April**

- Chakyung addition (CIVA hype!) + April Story was good. (but was not successful enough)

- Unfortunately DSP is bad with giving them good titles public would love.


***
**Niche Queens**
***


**Dreamcatcher**

- Unique concept reminding of some anime with rare rock sound that can be hard to find. Fills niche uncovered.

- Going for niche concept has grown them popularity with people who will like them quickly, but can be holding back from being more publicly popular. (In other words, weebs quickly love them, others not much)

**Loona / Girl of the Month**

- Multi concept of talented girls debuting with solo release is a unique way has caught attention of some who were looking for new things.

- Unfortunately, the company's attempt on different promotions like bus stop advertisement is not effective.


***
**Out of Nugudom. Barely**
***


**CLC**

- They are relatively unpopular within soldiers but they are more of girlcrush, and sell quite well outside, thanks to female fans.

- Sudden concept changes back and forth hurts fandom staying royal.


**Sonamoo**

- Very talented and beautiful members surprise a lot of people that they are unknown.

- D-ANA appearance from IDOT helped her and group's popularity well.

- Eujin is carrying atm with Unit no.1

- Possibly the group with worst name ever. Imo. (Yes I have strong feelings about this.)

- ex: Pinetree has been associated with old guys' royalty to their king/boss for a while in Korea.
Not really something that connects with young, sexy girls.


**Dia**

- Barely surviving only thanks to Chae-yeon, whose face can be easily seen with many ads.


**Momoland**

- JooE the meme-ad queen. But what else?


**Brave Girls**

- Liked a lot among military for being powerful sexy noonas, but failing to grab public attention.

**Stellar**

- They grabbed our attention with Marionette being super sexy.

- Then messy management with member change killed most of hype.


***

**Short summary of boy groups ~~tolerated~~ liked in within military**

***

BigBang used to be undisputable no.1 bg within males, but Top's controversy has dropped the public likness quite significantly... (the point that he isn't going to do standard service being biggest)

Older groups who tend to focus a lot on vocal + hilarious on variety are often casually liked by guys too from what I have seen. (Ex Highlight, B1A4, BtoB, Infinite)

There was some casual fans of Seventeen with their fun songs like Aju Nice, but that interest was largely gone with Dont Wanna Cry which felt more mature and less fun.

I did couple of guys appreciating Exo and WannaOne, but more of casual praise in passing then anything from fan.


***
**Some random stuff you guys are probably interested in.**
***

- Pd101 was considered ridiculous at first, but soon enough most were crazy about it, some doing fanwars about who is better girl. But we did not give a care about ~~bois version~~ season 2.

- Unit and Mixnine haven't gotten that much interest yet, and it seems public has gotten tired of such survival shows, but those who did watch it seemed to prefer latter.

- One of officers I am close with mentioned Nayoung (pre-IOI, now Pristin member) was popular in his town as something of 'Sleeping Beauty' - the attractive, popular girl who slept through every class except for PE and lunch break.

- Not really related to Kpop, but someone joked about two rappers in High School Rap (Hiphop competition for high schoolers from Mnet) were gay when they started showing some bromance, and others watching took it...quite maturely well. 'I am glad homos are can stand up now' 'Brave of them to show up.' 'Kind of others for not judging' etc.  

- I asked some comrades (prob wrong word choice but I am discharged now, whatever) about their views on gay after that. Most common answer was 'As long as they are not after my ass, I don't give a shit about someone being gay.' and 'Guess more gays means more chance for me to get a girl'

***
**Stuffs some of you have asked me.**
***

&gt;Do people care about Nate/Ilbe comments and posts?

While they are popular sites, they are considered something like to how 4chan is viewed. People don't really care about what these sites say unless it goes viral over other SNS.


&gt;How do you gauge how popular a group is? / How did you made this list of popularity order?

There are several ways to try to gauge a group's popularity. All of them controversial or lacking in some ways but one can try adding it all up and give an attempt.

*Album sales - Physical*

This often shows the power of fandom, because it is usually hardcore fans who buy albums, a lot of them buying more than one for supporting their fav. That and fansign lottery, which is huge motivation. 

There are soft 'cut' which is the least of amount of album you have to be sure to get into a group's fansign, which changes upon the group's popularity and quality of album. 

(Boy groups tend to have high album sale thanks to strong fandom, which often get competitive with each other)

*Stream/download - Digital*

This often shows the power of light fan (public appeal), because a lot of people use streaming service to listen to music, so people who aren't invested enough to buy album and do other core fan stuff, are likely to stream and download their songs.

(Girl groups tend to have chart high in such ranks because they easier to be generally liked by public.)

*Variety appearance - TV*

Something that I personally think is overshadowed by i-fandom. A good variety appearance can solidify good number of core fans and introduce the group/member shown to public, which can be huge popularity boost.

And also when they are on more popular shows (ex Knowing Bros, Infinite Challenge), it often also means they have gotten popular enough for such shows to try putting them on as guests.


*Advertisement - Various*

When groups/members get plastered over tv/internet/shops/streets for commercials, you know they got popular enough for advertising companies try using them.

*Concert - Tickets*

Being able to plan out and sell out concerts is proof of having enough dedicated fandom.

&gt;Will you do most popular member list?

I tried making this after some request, found it hard if not impossible to make and has given up on this.


&gt;Can you teach me Korean?

&gt;Can you translate this for me?

No. I wont. /r/korean has lots of helpful people and guides, head over there if you want help.

[I did make a *very* seldom updated Korean often slang list though!](https://www.reddit.com/r/OwlOfJune/comments/6gcd4b/kpop_term_list_wip/?st=jbxji6x8&amp;sh=e3d328d5)

&gt;Can I take this and post it elsewhere?

Sure, just leave my Reddict nickname and send me a link.

I know Koreaboo has taken my older post, while I dont mind it, would prefer they do notify me.

Through reddit or email owlofjune@daum.net would be nice. I do have twitter https://twitter.com/owlofjune , though mostly abandoned is option to send re-post links.

Like how they interact with other groups, or had a close relationship with one or more members in that group because they were friends before their respective debuts. Maybe they got known each other while promoting at the same time.

I would like to pick GFriend as the friendliest group, because of their beagle-like personality, everyone can be their friend (Buddy reference).  I will first list the groups/members that have connection with GFriend then I'll proceed with individual members (if there are group members that I haven't mentioned, sorry for that):

&amp;nbsp;

**GFriend**

Twice - they are considered to be rivals by most kpop followers but they are actually **friends** [(GFriend performed Like Ooh-Ahh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Os5wuyPEks), [(Twice performed Me Gustas Tu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAM_swBFUSM), [(Both performed Gee)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kva3820DDw). They were guested twice together on Weekly Idol (2015 Christmas Special &amp; 5th Anniversary) and there are more...

Mamamoo - GFriend is the innocent version of them because of their beagle-like personality. [GFriend invading Mamamoo's waiting room on VLive broadcast](http://www.vlive.tv/video/6354). They were both guested on the [7th season of Showtime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0ViB7lSiBGYRwXYQY2qoQ). They were both guested on [Weekly Idol Summer Vacation Special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3sHWGoe-L4).

Heechul - Heechul ~~is just a GFriend trash/~~have a deep connection to GFriend when Yerin starred to his music video.

BTS - both CEO of their companies are best friends. I just take this with a grain of salt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sowon** (DSP Media trainee before joining Source Music)

Friends with Pristin's Nayoung &amp; Apink's Namjoo. Has in touch with KARD members.

&amp;nbsp;

Most of the contestants that were in ""Her Secret Weapon"" are her friends especially Laboum's Solbin &amp; Fiestar's Cao Lu. Friends with Twice's Jihyo &amp; Sana. Also with Apink's Hayoung &amp; Red Velvet's Joy since they were classmates on SOPA. Few interactions with Weki Meki's Doyeon, Yoojung, Gugudan's Mina &amp; IOI's Somi.

What do you expect from them
  
A summary for those not in the know  
**JYP**  
-The Stray Kids are confirmed to debut this year.  Coming off a reality debut ~~totally not a~~ ""survival show"" and the Hellevator track they produced, they've gotten a fairly high amount of interest especially among i-fans  
-Also introduced in the Stray Kids show would be the next generation of JYPs girl trainees, currently titled Girls2Team, and will very likely debut with Somi.  One of them in particular, [Shin Ryujin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vNgwTqN6Vo) has gotten some attention from being on Mix9 and appearing in the Love Yourself concept trailers from Big Hit  
  
**SM** 
-SR~~16~~~~17~~18G is widely believed to be debuting this year due to SM's meticulous detail for debuting a group every 2 years.  
-As for boy groups, SM will still be sticking with NCT for now.  The dungeon is full of possible new members and units for whatever they have planned.
  
**YG**  
-YG's current boy trainees was also showcased in Stray Kids in one of their usual friendly YG vs. JYP trainee show off battles.  [See a clip here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DxPSenolo).  They won't be debuting this year (I think?) but keep an eye out for early 2019.  
-I'm actually kind of in the dark about what's going on with YG's girl trainees",78,101

A song that put them on top, a song that changed their style, a song that changed your group for better or worse?

For example, Lies was probably BigBang's breakthrough song, that turned them from 'ugly' rookies to the upwards trajectory towards legends. Another would be I Need U by BTS, which arguably was a deviation from the Hip-Hop inspired title tracks that they had released up to that point and won them their first music show award.",139,113

For those who won goodies from the first round, I have sent half and will get the remaining ones done tomorrow!  

  
[**ORG THREAD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7ne1oz/new_years_giveaway_time_part_2_big_stuff/)  

I've had a look through your submissions and have picked the winners. As with the previous giveaway, here are some long-winded details first:  
  
- Lottery done on https://namepickerninja.com/#  
- To ensure fairness (because anyone could have edited the google doc), I did a 3-step checking process of users. 1. Comments are present (under correct comment chain) on main thread along with screenshot, 2. Name present in Google Doc and 3. Double-checked each individual user page to see if they left a comment.  
- I had to manually key in some names who left proper screenshots but their name disappeared
- Plenty of names on google doc with no accompanying comment (mainly Twice albums -_-)

- Winners must respond to my PM within 24 hours (I'll be generous this time because I have work tomorrow)  
- Prize will go to the next lottery pick, and so on.  
  
For those who are lucky enough to win the [**Dreamcatcher**](https://i.imgur.com/JUOlTGO.jpg) albums that /u/NudePenguin69 is giving away, I will PM you **only** to inform that you've won. You have to PM them yourself to make arrangements for shipping and so on.

This month's theme is **""Music Show Winners""**!

Winning a music show is one of an idol group's and agency's dream achievements. It doesn't happen always, but when it does it usually means the song is pretty special. There have been a lot of ""Finally got their first win!"" moments. This is a thread to celebrate those songs that were so great (or timing that was so precise) to win the recognition of the public and officially be recognized as great! 

Post you favorite songs that have gotten artists award show wins! Submissions should be **at least one year old**.

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment

Some things to consider..

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2. Because this has occurred before... if I don't reply back to you is because I'm tired of writing back to people that the song you requested has already been translated and I found it in 5s using google. If there is previously translated lyrics thats hard to understand, give me a link so I know at least you looked and I'll judge it it warrants a better translation.

3. For the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

4. It must be a original song with lyrics. Some of the idols rap/lyrics are hard to understand. So I cannot do live, remix, free style, version of whatever song. 

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P",46,23

432,2018-01-06,2018,1,6,11,7ogfz6,Was 2017 the Best Year for Kpop?,Oreo_Musician,1515206230,"To put it bluntly: NO. 2017 was not the best year for Kpop and Im a little surprised that some people say that it is. Like, did you only pay attention to the musical aspect of it? Sure, there were various quality songs by mainstream and underrated groups, but the industry as a whole suffered a bit this year. 

As many already know, 2017 brought the worst moment in the Kpop world: the passing of SHINees Jonghyun. Jonghyuns death should be an eye-opener for fans and the industry. A couple of idols have stated their battles with depression, but whos to say their getting help? Who would have thought that someone who loved music so much, who end up battling depression and then ending his own life? This is coming from a SHINee fan. I couldnt believe it when I heard the news. It truly broke my heart. These idols go through so many things, sometimes some of us ignore the really big picture. They seem happy on screen and stage, but lets remember, theyre acting. We need to be more alert with our idols and raise awareness if one of them mentions depression.  (I dont mean to upset anyone by mentioning Jonghyun. I loved him and SHINee very much. May he Rest In Peace)

Another thing is that various groups disbanded and some members even left. Sistar, 2NE1, Miss A, Wonder Girls, etc. These groups will be dearly missed and their biggest fans wont be able to get to hear new music from those groups anymore. But, hopefully, the members of the groups will be able to succeed in whatever they do in the future. 

So, was it the best Kpop year? In my opinion, NO. Whats yours? Do you think it was the best year, or one of the worst years? ",7,0

I just started watching Master Key and noticed that the first thing Astros Cha Eunwoo said when he saw a camera was his groups introduction, which struck me as him being very loyal to his group and wanting to promote Astro even in a situation where he didnt necessarily have to.

Im simply putting out a little bit of my frustration as a Kpop fanboy. At this point, I dont care what others think of me and my music taste, but I mean, it doesnt mean that I dont care about the topic to at least talk about it.

Now, I dont mean to trigger anyone, this is just opinion and a bit of experience Ive had as a fanboy.

I have been a Kpop fan since 2012, not because of PSY, but because of SHINee. I was scrolling through YouTube and it suggested Sherlock (which became my favorite SHINee song ever). Anyway, I fell in love Kpop and became a multi-fandom fan (play dramatic music). 

I never really told anyone about my liking of it for a while, but then I showed my friends and family; an its when I realized that apparently listening to music in another language is considered really weird. I got called gay. I got constant questions of why I listen to them and told that I dont even understand what theyre saying. I was told that Kpop was meant for girls and girls only. This isnt just coming from my family but from other Kpop fans that Ive met and talked with. But, when I meet a fanboy, they can reciprocate some of the feeling and we have a good time talking with each other and whatnot. 

I just feel like fanboys shouldnt be judged so harshly. Now, Im not saying that this solely applies to fanboys, because I know girls who have gotten teased and stuff, too. But, I find that people find it more acceptable for girls to be more Kpop fans than guys. 

What do you guys think? ",152,141

Kpop has different meanings in everyones lives. We all experience it differently, but enjoy it all the same. 

Kpop to me is...fun, uplifting, and comforting. Kpop means a lot to me because it helped me when I was dealing with depression. I appreciate the music genre so much and the idols that care so much for their fans. 

I just felt so at home with Kpop. Like, idols really try to get in touch with all their fans, make them feel like family. 

Even though I might now understand it, Kpop is always fun to listen to.

First Jukebox of 2018 and first time participating? Not sure how it works? Heres an explanation! You get to listen to all seven of these songs and then leave a review as a reply to the comment with the artists name and title. You can say whatever you want about the song - how it makes you feel, thoughts on production, the musical content, the vocals - its your space to give your thoughts and opinions! Leave with your review a score of the song on a scale between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, then you are allowed to review the MV as well, although you are in no way required to - its totally optional! As always, you can review songs up to this Friday at 11:59 PM PST. 

As a reminder, I dont pick the songs on Jukebox - they are randomly generated and, as always, screenshots will be in the Other Business section of the comments. I did pick how this Jukebox was formatted  SEVENTEEN spotlight, three more songs to review (so ten songs total reviewed from 2017), and a new song from this year. How each song from all those categories was all picked though was done so randomly.

Personal Favorite Kpop Discographies:
Red Velvet (esp. loved songs from The Red and Perfect Velvet)

F(x) (constantly listen to their Pink Tape album, has amazing b-sides)

EXID (really liked songs from Ah Yeah and Street)

IU (esp. loved songs from Modern Times and Chatshire, havent listened to Palette yet)

Dean (though he is a K-R&amp;B Artist, he still has a great discography; his 130 Mood: Trbl mini album is one of my favorite mini-albums) 

BTS (has tons of strong material throughout their discography) 

Big Bang (have always loved most of their title tracks and songs on Alive and MADE.)

Winner (2014 S/S is still one of my favorite albums...)

523,2018-01-07,2018,1,7,21,7oqalt,About T-ARA,Astutelymed,1515327559,"Hi everyone, Im writing this here because I dont know how else to reach out to the general K-pop community. 

**History**

T-ARAs company, Music Beyond Korea (MBK) Entertainment, formerly known as Core Contents Media (CCM), is helmed by CEO Kim Kwang Soo. Hes known for ridiculous antics. At the peak of T-ARAs fame, he said something like [T-ARA will be reorganised into a 9 member rotating system, if existing members are lazy, theyll be kicked from the group without a second word.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.allkpop.com/article/2012/04/op-ed-is-t-aras-member-change-a-way-for-kim-kwang-soo-to-punish-t-ara)

Im not going to focus what ex-member Ryu Hwa Young did, [you can read it here.](http://tiaradiadem.com/2017/02/a-chronological-timeline-and-conclusion-of-the-t-ara-scandal-dispatchs-interview-with-t-aras-staff/) Two (run-on) sentences to sum it up: T-ARAs only at fault for the 5 tweets that exposed the internal shitstorm to the world, but honestly, would you be able to take it if youre working with a co-worker who parachuted in with such shitty attitude? She literally acted all haughty by refusing to perform, leaving our 6-ara having to re-organise choreography just for her; she also acted very rude to salon staff by name-calling them Hey Shampoo!; most importantly, she merely had a leg ACHE, but put on a show to appear at the airport/concert/various stages in a cast and asked people to hold her while she limped through or sat in a wheelchair. Its all in the link, happy reading if youre keen. 


**How do Queens feel about this?**

One sentence to sum it all up: ***We dont believe in anyone else but T-ARA.*** What do I mean? When shit broke out, N*tizenbuzz rallied what was possibly the largest anti T-ARA movement based on gifs taken entirely out of context, misinterpretions, and lots of other K-pop fandoms added fuel to the fire. We Queens were all alone  in fact, people spewed hate at us just for supporting T-ARA. Though I personally feel that some Queens are overprotective of our girls, I hope you can understand this is all the product of how we were treated back then. Literally nobody had our backs. We put up clarifications posts, but I suppose people only saw what they wanted to.

So we really rallied together. My personal opinion of the fandom: prior to the fiasco, it was divided into 2: Holy Trinity (Eunjung, Hyomin, Jiyeon) fans, and QBS fans. QBS fans were always salty how our biases got less promotion, while the HT fans kinda shitted on us for overreacting or something. I dont know, I forgot. But after this, everything kinda healed. No matter which member, we pour 1001% of our support to them; we let every member of T-ARA know that THEY ARE STILL LOVED BY SO MANY. We rallied together like never before, and at every chance we got, we voted like crazy. :) if youre from another fandom and youre helping us, thank you. Otherwise, we can do it on our own too. Also: ***we wont believe what anyone else says, unless its straight from the members mouth.*** I hope you do so too, given MBKs lying, deceitful past.

**What makes MBK so horrible? Every entertainment company is bad, anyway.**

- Before T-ARA, there was [Turbo (Kim Jong Kooks group)](https://onehallyu.com/topic/240579-please-read-kim-jongkook-was-abused-by-mbkccms-kim-kwangsoo-c-jess-baek-changjoo/), and Seeya. The posts gonna be longer than the Great Wall of China if I continue, but the summary is that MBK was involved in using gangsters, violence, and verbal abuse to Turbo to force them to handover their earnings (Aka why Kim Jong Kook gyms like crazy, he first learnt it for self-defence. He has a severe case of herniated disc from the abuse he got from his Turbo days  this is the reason why he failed to qualify for active army service, and continues to gym till this day.)

- Overworks/exploits everyone for money: Overworking Jiyeon who had to perform at numerous events despite a high fever, and she fainted immediately after a music show stage. [Let DIA perform at some shady nightclub.](https://pannative.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-recent-whereabouts-of-dia.html) Mind you, DIA has minor members. 

- Is not afraid to throw their artist under the bus/history of lying: VERY RECENTLY tried to stir shit by saying Soyeon and Boram (whose contracts expired earlier) [are not co-operative, skipped practices, and one-sidedly decided to cut contact despite promising to appear for a concert, scheduled after their contract expiration.](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/05/13/mbke-unsurprisingly-full-of-shit-t-ara-all-show-up-for-taipei-concert/) Of course, my SsoRam showed up for the concert, and the best part? 6-ARA performed songs they never did before, which means obviously SsoRam practiced with the other members. 

This is really just one of the many cases where MBK lied; when Seeya/Turbo left the company, the company moved to block composers from giving Kim Jong Kook songs, lied about what caused Seeya to disband, etc, etc. (Proof are in links above.) MBK is notorious for putting out false media pieces, and just being really shady in general. Also, remember when KKS was reportedly hospitalised from heart attack? [Maybe the news is fake too.](https://mobile.twitter.com/oh_mes/status/939570701161385987) Theres been no follow-up ever since. Why would he mediaplay about such things? Nobody knows, really. Ive been in the fandom so long, and MBKs actions still puzzle me till this day.

In this light, I urge you not to believe the news about T-ARA.

**On the other hand, the T-ARA members...**

- Showed immense loyalty by [***quietly renewing their contracts with MBK, twice.***](http://tiaradiadem.com/forums/topic/32220-161107-t-ara-on-kim-kwang-soo-he-is-our-immediate-leader-we-re-signed-twice/?tab=comments#comment-484742). 

&gt; T-ara expressed their love and faithfulness towards MBK Entertainments CEO Kim Kwangsoo. They had their ups and downs but T-ara emphasized on CEO Kim Kwangsoos credits for giving them the opportunity to reach this position. ***All this while, they were steadily having activities and re-signed their contract twice.*** While other girl groups contracts expired and disbanded, T-ara firmly maintained their team and that was actually very much influenced by their contract expiry date. 

Angels, if you ask me. 

**What now?**

As we all know, [T-ARAs contracts recently expired](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2018/01/03/hyomin-writes-letter-that-reveals-t-ara-is-free-mbk-says-the-group-is-not-disbanded/). As a fandom, Queens are more than happy to see our girls rest. However, MBK has a history of lying, and now MBKs starting shit again: firstly, falsely claiming that Hyomins dating some media CEO; and now, theres another piece of news that says that Sicong, Banana Cultures CEO (T-ARAs China management) gifted each T-ARA member a luxury sports car. ***I urge everyone not to buy into these stories easily.*** Dont join the trolls, dont make fun of the situation. Its something very serious, and after all the T-ARA has been through, I really hope everyone realises their mistake and show solidary with us, Queens. It has never been easy for us, or the girls, and we worked so hard to prove everyone wrong. 

As the air gradually cleared, things seemed to get better. T-ARA [FINALLY landed their first win in 5 years in 2017](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/06/20/t-ara-win-music-show-for-the-1st-time-in-over-5-years-in-bittersweet-moment/), and they had really loud and deafening fanchants during Dream Concert. They were so touched they cried the entire encore stage and couldnt get a word in, and after Dream Concert, they [were so happy they literally couldnt sleep that night](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/09/12/t-ara-get-overwhelming-response-at-incheon-k-pop-concert-makes-them-emotional/).

But now, times are tumultuous once again. Queens are always ready to fight, and I can only hope youll join us, or at least not make things worse for us. ***Its not fun, its not drama, not tea, its our future***. 

Dont click on any n*tizenbuzz links, at least not those about T-ARA, because shes really cherry-picking the worst comments, the worst articles (which spews lies about T-ARA) to translate. There are lots of times where Queens found (lots more) positive articles with nearly 10x the amount of upvotes  these all went untranslated. Of course, we could translate it ourselves, but the general public isnt gonna look at it, right?

Dont forget T-ARA quite literally was the second gg behind SNSD at their peak. Roly Poly stayed 11 weeks straight at 2nd place in Music Bank and topped that years download charts :) Im lazy to link the sources... T-ARA are still awesomely popular in especially China and Vietnam and very much so everywhere else in the world. We Queens are a really strong bunch, but Im still hoping that the general public sees the (long overdue) light. Please understand our anger and how indignant we are.

**How can I help?**

Thank you if youd like to go a step further. What were always doing is to leave supportive comments at Korean news pieces, using either your Twitter/Facebook account. You can check out [@6araNate](http://twitter.com/6araNate) and [@TaraNaver](http://twitter.com/TaraNaver). Otherwise, not propagating false rumours, not believing whatever news pieces MBK puts out, not participating in blind bandwagon hate is really the best to do to help us.

Thank you so much for reading.  Please be kind. 

Edited for grammar. 
Edited once again for clarity. Thank you for the feedback! I won't be editing any further.

The only examples I can think of are:

[Big Bang - Bae Bae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKD03uPVD-Q)... It follows the typical YG song progression, but the instrumental sounds so fresh and the I love the fusion of playful rap and emotional singing.

Mostly these would show up in choruses or pre-chorus parts; often times it gives a refreshing vibe and maybe even satisfaction of hearing different members sing the same thing and give it unique styles.

For example:

[BTS - Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU)  Jungkook sings the first, Jin does the second prechorus. I love both equally but *Jin's version is just*

[Twice - Like Ooh Ahh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtV5esQT6I)  Jeongyeon sings the first half of the last chorus instead of Nayeon. Can I just say I loved it when Twice did this all the time? *Bring back last chorus Jeongyeon*

[DAY6 - I Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3nFopIjmjI)  The second half of three choruses were sang by ~~Brian~~ Young K, Wonpil, and Jae; each member brought a different edge each time. Love it when Day6 does this (and they do it a lot, too!)


PS: I asked this because I like editing the audio and putting these kinds of parts on top of each other, separating it to left-right channels [(example ft. Lotto)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ktkl3timo2ru8et/lotto%20doublelift%20chorus%201%202.mp3?dl=0) so I could hear *both versions at the same time*, bless. ~~lowkey looking for more of these through y'all comments~~",91,105

Taemin is an amazing freestyle dancer, but most of you know that (also if anyone has any older videos of him dancing, please post them). Kahi, Hyoyeon, Jay Park also come to mind for the second gen dancers.

Out of the newer gen, I still believe Astro's Rocky and NCT's Ten are the best male dancers we have rn and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_WqhYGPYtE) video of them having a freestyle battle on Hit the Stage proves it. 

Apart from that, Wanna One's Ong Seongwu showing people how popping is [done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRdLHLpNUk&amp;t=108s) and JBJ/Hotshot's Taehyun dominating [as usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mBjFhNy-d0)

So what do you think? Are these group making K-pop reality shows good or bad for K-pop? Is it sustainable?

Welcome to this mess of a [Stray Kids](https://imgur.com/a/P40sV) introduction/content index. I know its kind of weird to have a spotlight for a group that hasn't even debuted yet, but I think Stray Kids has a lot of potential and hope this will help get more people interested in them before their debut! Going forward, I will update all Stray Kids video content in **[this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Va-Ignj8r549wBd_D2SbL07ofckK-UUMgBJHWNYuSHI/edit?usp=sharing)** (empty at the moment). Please let me know if you would like to help maintain it :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Reasons to follow Stray Kids:**

* Self composed songs (members helped write/compose every song on the album) ~~get those credits Chan~~
* Member-written lyrics that are [personal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppt_dzcvF0I) and can be [relatable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYj2eNJfcT8) (ex. dealing with the [struggles of youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj7JKh-sqaM)/[growing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMHlA9Qlu8M))

##3RACHA

####What is 3RACHA?

3RACHA is made up of three members of the Stray Kids rapline: Chan (CB97), Changbin (SPEARB) and Jisung (J.ONE). They have been releasing songs since January 2017. They release a song every two weeks (used to be two songs per two weeks - explained in the deleted songs section) and have released 3 EPs. (Unfortunately a lot of the older tracks do not have subs) **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM6nufSHfOY0POkLofL2rQ) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/3racha)**

**DELETED SONGS**

When 3RACHA initially started releasing music, they released 2 songs every two weeks - one being an original production, the other being a track cover (their own lyrics over existing songs/beats). The track covers were deleted from their official channels. If you want to listen to them, I've compiled all the ones I could find below:

Welcome to this mess of a [Stray Kids](https://imgur.com/a/P40sV) introduction/content index. I know its kind of weird to have a spotlight for a group that hasn't even debuted yet, but I think Stray Kids has a lot of potential and hope this will help get more people interested in them before their debut! Going forward, I will update all Stray Kids video content in **[this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Va-Ignj8r549wBd_D2SbL07ofckK-UUMgBJHWNYuSHI/edit?usp=sharing)** (empty at the moment). Please let me know if you would like to help maintain it :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Reasons to follow Stray Kids:**

* Self composed songs (members helped write/compose every song on the album) ~~get those credits Chan~~
* Member-written lyrics that are [personal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppt_dzcvF0I) and can be [relatable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYj2eNJfcT8) (ex. dealing with the [struggles of youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj7JKh-sqaM)/[growing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMHlA9Qlu8M))
* [Very strong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srXPwHOacw) rappers and a group of [talented dancers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro6pk_qVyAM)

##3RACHA

####What is 3RACHA?

3RACHA is made up of three members of the Stray Kids rapline: Chan (CB97), Changbin (SPEARB) and Jisung (J.ONE). They have been releasing songs since January 2017. They release a song every two weeks (used to be two songs per two weeks - explained in the deleted songs section) and have released 3 EPs. (Unfortunately a lot of the older tracks do not have subs) **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM6nufSHfOY0POkLofL2rQ) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/3racha)**

**DELETED SONGS**

When 3RACHA initially started releasing music, they released 2 songs every two weeks - one being an original production, the other being a track cover (their own lyrics over existing songs/beats). The track covers were deleted from their official channels. If you want to listen to them, I've compiled all the ones I could find below:

 Rank your top ten Music Videos of 2017. #1 gets 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, #3 gets 8 points etc.

 Do not rank the songs in reverse order.

 Upvoting/Downvoting someone else's ranking will not impact the results

 Japanese/Chinese/English language music videos are eligible if the artist/group is Korean 

 Japanese/Chinese/English/Korean versions of a music video will be considered the same video unless they are significantly different 

(ex.: the Japanese version of TT and the Japanese Version of Limitless are considered separate from their Korean counterparts.The Japanese version of As If It's Your Last is not because the video is more or less the same as the Korean video)

 PLAIN TEXT ONLY - No Bold, Italics, quotations around the song title, etc. 

 All K-Genres are eligible 

 Proper formatting is #. Artist - Song Title (Specification if needed)

 Don't include features or any form of the word version

2. Taemin - Move (Solo)
3. Taemin - Move (Duo)

Seeing interesting threads about synesthesia recently made me want to cultivate a keener appreciation for color. 
One simple way I thought of doing so was using an already existing interest in Kpop.

---

Here are a few to me that looks *so right* :

* The opening for A.C.E's [Callin](https://youtu.be/6uuBP8r3NV4?t=1s) 

* Taeyang's segment in [BANG BANG BANG](https://youtu.be/2ips2mM7Zqw?t=12s) (0.12)

A lot of groups that debut each year either disband or go inactive, so I thought a shout out to the ones who made it through so far would be nice. I usually post a short review of the group but Ill reserve that for my next few posts. This may seem like a short list because I wont be including soloists or non-idol artists here; you never know who might pop out another single or two.
  
All pictures contain the current lineup.

[APL, Dam Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/20drEA8)|[Might Die] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70nwF0BclFo)|When they debuted they released both a [Korean] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lqv0J9M2Gk) and [Chinese] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHoNvaJEcI) version of Might Die, although I must say that I prefer the Show Champion title, [re gon a die] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsYkUlF46L4). Earlier this year they released Dont Be Mad in [Korean] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT_HF661Qp4) and [Japanese] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7znDHK3LABQ) and while welcoming new member Tom to their lineup.
[BLACKPINK, YG Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/sOsovHd)|[Boombayah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmSjveL3Lc) and [Whistle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dISNgvVpWlo)|Sigh. Even though theyre still locked in YGs dungeon, they managed to eke out three more songs: [Playing With Fire] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pdj4iJD08s), [Stay] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzVR_fymZw4), and [As If Its Your Last] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq-qlqbjYA). Theyre reported to comeback in January 2018 but when translated from YG to real life it means theyll probably be on hiatus for a year. 
[Cosmic Girls/WJSN, Starship Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/uXWJ1n6)|[MoMoMo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRJqH0Plqg8) and [Catch Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLwAAhhXBo)|After the success of Produce 101, Yeonjung was added to the group. Theyve since released [2016s Song of the Year] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w), [I Wish] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7gOqqbBW6w), [Happy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZVB_zCBlCU) and CF song [Kiss Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSG_plpPA58).
[Gugudan, Jellyfish Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/NTe15sY)|[Wonderland] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej-PBlE4ODQ)|After debuting with the Wonderland, Gx9 (because I can) has continued with the Act series. They came back in early 2017 with [A Girl Like Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxtwvLUByM), and closed 2017 out with [the best creepy music video youve ever seen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLVSf_yI_r8).
[Highteen, Illusion Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/RWtzIl4)|[Boom Boom Clap] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HGKGpHtKI)|Most people thought they debuted with [Grow Up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abxKM7cmzO8), but it was just a pre-debut release. For you Idol School fans, Jessica Lee was supposed to debut with this group but left after Grow Up was released. Now, Boom Boom Clap, their actual debut song, is where its at. They made a comeback this year with [Would You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjg5SrPwDNg). Eunjin was on Mixnine (because vocals) but she was recently voted off.
[Holics, LPA Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/WUODSmF)|[U.Lie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDEyVonApHA) and [Our Story] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUsbLxiZMEc)|Holics made a comeback a few months ago with [Funky Dunky] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNk8oZ2yeQ), which is their best quality song so far, and began promoting on music shows in December. They seem to be inactive but they perform at a lot of events. Most recently, Yeonjung and soon-to-debut I.ONE member Eunsol recorded [a cover of Yoon Jongshins Like It] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSWs9ed7RY0).
[Imfact, Star Empire Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/vjUbzZY)|[Lollipop] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_CTPzCHElU)|Although Imfact continued their Nae-Nae legacy with [Feel So Good] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOXVTjlF2pk), they finally graduated from the dance trend with [In The Club] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkw13o9GPtg), which is not what you think it is. They have also released singles [Please Be My Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97x8ufRH7bA) and [Tension Up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNlXODCoaI). As of now, some members are participating in The Unit.
[KNK, YNB Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/e3Kytlt)|[When will your faves?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVDIZcb6Og)|Everyone had high expectations after KNKs ~~beautiful, gorgeous, talented~~ great debut, and their first two comebacks, [Bagel Game(I apologize)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp34Lfv3OLc) did not disappoint. They followed up with the drama-surrounded (not really) [U] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sfxDj9OJ4) and their two most recent songs, [Sun.Moon.Star.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy6w5yKG7jU) and [Rain] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MWc2NXtit4).
[MASC, JJ Holic Media] (https://imgur.com/dG1RzJV)|[Strange] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfmGJbqr0k)|Masc has made their first comeback with [Tina]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_gZU7yWpls), and then gave fans a nice surprise by adding four new members before releasing their latest song, [Do It!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCU7MwI12rk).
[Matilda, Box Media] (https://imgur.com/LnbRMZv)|[Macarena] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZQq4oFlIlo)| They came back with two songs, the light-hearted [Summer Again] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L6IwJeD0lE), and the somewhat divisive [You Bad! Dont Make Me Cry] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeNQcoKfQ2k). Matilda has been gaining more and more attention for their beagle personalities and impressive vocal talent. They are currently participating (and impressing!) on the unit (although Saebyeol and Haena were eliminated). They made Taemin go goofy. Only talent.
[Momoland, Duble Kick Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/hG1yeuI)|[Jjan! Koong! Kwang!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE3z5Wjcw7E)|After Jjan! Koong! Kwang!, Momoland came back strong with [Freeze] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywAXliT2wKk) after adding two members, ex-JYP trainee Daisy and Produce 101s Taeha (aka Junsus cousin) who were first featured in [Wonderful Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkSv0TkvTRs). JooE began attracting more attention to the group because shes the best dancer in the world. The momentum generated from JooEs exposure (and general love for Nancy) hyped up their most recent comeback, which is indisputably [2018s Song of the Year (besides LOONA)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGRg8XBnB4).
[NCT 127, SM Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/ZLUn1lo)|[*Sobangcha*] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_psXn_VJ_AE)|NCT 127 has been on an upward trajectory despite some anti and non-believers wanting them to be nugus (not gonna happen, love). They released their first unit comeback, [Limitless] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW8iyJcmve4) in early 2017. Later on, they released [the biggest hit on this page] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkuHLzMMTZM).
[NCT Dream, SM Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/gSbv8YX)|[Chewing Gum] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwmvF5ffmhg)|The group also known as SM Babies (sorry Mark). After Chew-chew-chew-chewing gum, they came back with [My First and Last] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pUc7SD0PmU). Later in 2017, they released [We Young] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3aP1cxwCyk), the most self-aware Kpop song title ever. 
[Pentagon, Cube Entertainment] ( https://imgur.com/9bYYzBj)|[Gorilla] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9pJQkZVuTA)|Pentagon is getting more popular every day it seems. Theyve released four mini-albums since debut, and Hui has gotten really popular due to composing PD101s never and Wanna Ones Energetic. As a group, theyve comeback with [Can You Feel It?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Dz-hOiZUE) And [Pretty Pretty] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ggyu3ZTFvA) from the Five Senses album, [Critical Beauty] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsbWd6sVFeo) from Ceremony, and [Like This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeLifhqRggg), [Violet] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A-xrTnIlOw), and [Runaway] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpRxiNM2sQ) from the Demo series.
[SF9, FNC Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/Bpp7az9)|[Fanfare] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id0c8yuwmTg)|SF9 is truly a *sensational* group. I get the *feeling* that these *nine* will be huge one day. Okay, Ill stop. Anyways, SF9 is building up a solid discography. All they need is that one song to capture the publics heart. Theyve had three Korean comebacks with [Roar] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLg_k_QpFgQ), [Easy Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl7Boo_1ZY), and [O Sole Mio] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUZeYOLp8Ys). 
[The East Light] (https://imgur.com/K8VQUwS)|[Holla] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3L6xB9i7JU)|These kids putout some good music, theyre too talented for words. Theyve gained some exposure from Woojins participation on Produce 101 Season 2. Theyve made two comebacks since their debut, [I Got You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oxOnWws0UQ) and [Youre My Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiGrgfoUlqM). Woojin and Sagang had a special release with [Love Is] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QglLFncNbGs).
[VICTON, Plan A Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/QwtkpH7)|[Im Fine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHJB_Zbn-lQ)|Victon is mostly known as Apinks dongsaeng group, although they have not yet gained Apinks level of popularity. After debuting, they came back with [Eyez Eyez] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlJp65MCqjo). Since then theyve released [Unbelievable] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfGcA7wA6E) and [Remember Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLvr9Q-iJcs).
[Vromance, RBW Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/AXJhrr6)|[She] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MICKDtMUm34)|As far as Im concerned Vromance debuted when they discovered singing. However, thats not how the real world works. Even before they debuted, they were building up quite the fanbase. Last year they came back with [Im Fine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfrGlaC_VMg) and released a bunch of OSTs. Right now, theyre competing on MIXNINE.
  
**They Sort of Made It**
   
Artist and Company|Debut Song|Updates
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
[Bulldok, Kconic Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/oZacNGu)|[Why Not?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnK_GOR3W8)|Kconic Entertainment was an irresponsible company before Bulldoks debut (note Scandals debut), and their management of the group afterwards did nothing to change this. Why Not? was a very strong debut, and had the members been under another company the moment probably wouldve kept increasing. Now, all of the original members are gone except for [Kimi] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW_L4NaJr2g), who gained some attention for her solo release. They will be coming back with three new members soon.
[CocoSori, Mole Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/FIxe3dz)|[Dark Circle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4SGYjRPx1g)|CocoSori is missed. Coco made her solo debut with [Wishy Washy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvngEmbh7xM), and Sori is still on Mixnine so until the show is finished we may not see a comeback from our favorite *active* quirky group. I will be playing [Exquisite] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHttanRj6VU) on replay until that day comes.
[NCT U, SM Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/5ADwwfG)|[7th Sense] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA)|NCT U hasnt done much since debut (which means one more hour of sleep for Mark) but that doesnt mean they wont comeback at some point. NCT units 127 and Dream have been quite active in comparison and I think there was talk of a SEA unit coming soon.
[Six Bomb, IW Company] (https://imgur.com/VAkLAKl)|[Wait Ten Years Baby] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6sdBeGv2Yc)|Six Bomb is in this category because the group was a re-debut, albeit with a new lineup, and right now its taking me a of effort to write nice things about this group. I dont hate Six Bomb, especially after the art that was Wait 10 Years Baby. However, I need someone to explain the them that [plastic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ7z96kOIUo) [surgery] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2LiJU5enw) is not a concept (probably shouldve put that money towards a better song).
[Sixth Sense, ANJ Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/DKSSKD2)|[Feel Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbc4CwZwYs)|Sixth Sense made it through 2016, but not like most other groups. They rebranded themselves in 2018 and re-debuted as Queendom with three original members. I think they had a lineup change, then came back with [Dont Go] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajr9_G-Eaw4) but then the official videos were removed, and now they are under a different company. Either way, we can only hope that Queendom will remain active in the future.
[Tem5ive, JW Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/W4oagIp)|[Miracle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_46E-h5Yjk)|Tem5ive is the first all-Filipina Kpop group. They were supposed to make a comeback in 2017 but it seems to have been delayed. [They had the MV filmed and everything!!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLqsv6W6X3E) International fans have had a somewhat mixed reaction to them but they have a nicely-sized Korean fanbase so theyre okay. I really hope they come back soon.
[Various, Cowl Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/a8VMxdM)|[U] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiHXhLTkSCI)|Various had one of the better cute concept debuts, and the members were commended for their vocals and synchronization. After a series of lineup changes, they came back with [Barbie Girl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ1HTPpfF0Q) (and had another change after that). Theyve been pretty active on social media, but there havent been any releases lately.
[Girls on Top, P&amp;P Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/fXrbuYj)|[High Heel] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edviaqzL1RI)|Girls on Top had some of the best all-around vocals for a girl group that debuted in 2016, and got almost no recognition for it. They came back with [I Dont Want to Lose the Dream] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMyuZgOXRWE). In early 2017, they released [Come Come] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjW3I3-kdjo), which I have been playing over and over and over again for the masses (I mean my family). Although they have done some singing events, Im begging for a comeback, even if its just a single.
[Sol-T, Probeat Entertainment] (https://imgur.com/G0ZZOKE)|[Curveball] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltYaxXSH4I)|After one comeback, [Bad Girls] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVYP8soNCSk), Sol-T hasnt been very active. Gyeowool was recently eliminated from Mixnine. The other members will be re-debuting in GBB, who will debut later this year, but two of them introduce themselves as members of both groups so Im very confused.

*January 11, 2018*

After a highly successful and much acclaimed [debut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4GIiYuzVQ), rookie group r/Kpop Sings announced on January 11, 2018 that they're planning a comeback with their second digital single amidst member changes and forthcoming additions. /u/IllllllllI, who served as the group's leader for their debut has transferred the leadership position to new addition u/dunechka in order to focus on their studies. /u/illlllllli will remain as a member, but plans to focus their energy as a support role, as the group's original comeback was more or less a solo effort on their part. u/dunechka is very grateful for her sunbaenim's hard work and is excited to lead the group. She promises to become a better u/dunechka who works hard and is diligent in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

The group is recruiting an indefinite number of members for the upcoming 2nd single (and future releases) who have experience working with and access to audio editing programs. Members will be working on compiling, cleaning up, and mixing the vocal files that will be submitted for the project, and administrative and organizational work will be managed by u/dunechka. The more the merrier and easier for everyone else. Members with basic video editing skills are also welcome, though the focus is on the audio. This will be an ongoing project group sponsored by r/kpop that aims to have releases every six weeks. R/kpop sings promises to show a fun and passionate image that shines with the energy of their teamwork.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR: r/kpop sings is COMING BACK but we need a team of AUDIO EDITORS willing to pitch in. We're organized as heckin and will be communicating via discord. If you're interested, post in the comments or DM me for the link!**",38,136

938,2018-01-12,2018,1,12,12,7ptyad,my s/o berates me for liking kpop.. and I just don't know what to do about it anymore,a55130,1515729043,"I don't know where to post this but I thought I'd post this here because it is KPOP related. I really enjoy KPOP, I love girl groups, boy groups, individual artists and everything in between, the music is so fantastic and it's just a great genre for me. 

Several years ago, I was seriously abused by someone close to me. It was so severe it brought me into such a depression it almost lead to my suicide. It was when things were getting so severe that I found SHINee. I started listening to them and the music genre became a safe place for me. It helped me through panic attacks, depressive episodes and any other struggles I was going through at the time. Over the years it became one of the few things in my life that I knew wouldn't hurt me, because a music genre can't abuse you like a person can. It was safe and it provided me happiness, simple as that. Now I am out of that relationship and I am with someone who cares for me and who is kind. But they constantly make fun of my love for KPOP. 

They say all I'm in it for is the ""boys"" and that the only reason I listen to the genre is because its like ""porn with singers"". This is CONSTANT, every time I look at a video or they see me listening to a korean artist they berate me and my music choice. It sucks, and really hurts my feelings. I've tried to explain to them that it gives me a form of happiness and that it's just something I enjoy but they always cut me off and say it's an excuse. It's getting to the point where I may just get rid of KPOP from my life so I don't get made fun of anymore. I just don't know what to do.

If you have any advice please help, I'd really appreciate it. 

TLDR; Every time I say, do or even listen to KPOP, my s/o makes fun of me.

If anyone has information on which 2012 debuted groups and idols have contracts up this year, please do tell! Other than FIESTAR and JJ Project, I'm not sure whether Kyungri, Woohee, Kaeun, VIXX, HELLOVENUS, B.A.P, etc, end this year. I believe EXO has a 10 year contract. SHINee should have last renewed in 2015 with a 3 year contract like SNSD in 2014 &amp; 2PM. ",111,173

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment

Some things to consider..

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2. for the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style, version of whatever song.

4. Because this has occurred before... if I don't reply back to you is because I'm tired of writing back to people that the song you requested has already been translated and I found it in 5s using google. If there is previously translated lyrics thats hard to understand, give me a link so I know at least you looked and I'll judge it it warrants a better translation.

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P",18,22

Some of the really well known ones are able to produce music together, like Toheart, appear on variety shows, or are subject to dating rumors. Some of my favorites are JHope and Zelo, Yugyeum and Jungkook, and Amber and Henry. Outside of their own groups, which idol friendships are your favorite? Do you think they can be harmful? Are there any you think are fake? 

NO HATE. Please be kind with your words. Spread the Multifandom love. If you disagree with someone's opinion, still be kind, even if you think they are wrong. ",190,220

So stop frontin

I know you want me, lets start talking!!!

Alright, after two rounds of special edition Jukeboxes, its back to the regular ol randomized song picks! Every song randomly picked was generated using random.org/lists. So, here we go! Did you jam out to IUs B-sides? Did you take DAY6 seriously? Did you enjoy your time in the Secret Garden or do you prefer staying in the Shadows? Here are this weeks songs! 

1. [GOT7 - A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eISomx-VMow)
2. [Oh My Girl - Secret Garden ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lznx5A7fNto)

As always, leave your review as a reply to the comment with the artist and song title. Talk about the music, instrumentation, lyrics, emotiveness, your own personal thoughts  whatever you want to talk about when leaving a review! Also with your review, please leave a score of the song between 1 and 10. If the song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can review the MV as well but are in no way required to. Feel free to review as many songs as you want!
Reminder: I dont pick the songs. They were all randomly picked. Screenshots will be in the comments later. The one song I did choose (since I get to pick a song this week) is f(x)s Shadow; its been in the back of my mind ever since I wrote about it in that unique/refreshing/experimental songs thread a couple days ago, and I figure its about time a Pink Tape song finally makes its way onto Jukebox. You can review songs up until this Friday at 11:59 PM PST.

Lay and Jackson are currently judges on a Chinese version of Produce 101, Jay Park is a judge on Asia's Got Talent, Kris and Luhan both have gone on to do Hollywood films etc etc. They've all fought really hard to get there. I can't even count how many times I've heard idols talk about how difficult training is. And it's even harder for foreigners I feel. Now, I only know so much, so I would love to hear some success stories of Non-Korean idols. Along with that, why are you proud of them? 

I'll start. It's hard for me to pick JUST one because there are so many, but I'll go with Vernon for now (though he's not technically Non-Korean, I still want to use him as an example here). I'm proud of him because, though he didn't have much of a language barrier since he moved back to Korea when he was young, he's mixed. I think he's gorgeous and brings a very uniquely beautiful look to Kpop, but there are still people who hate on him. The fact that he can be in a group as big as Seventeen, overcome the hardships of training AND hear ridiculous hate comments is really incredible to me. ",208,196

I ended up talking to him today and I gave a real heart to heart about how I was feeling about his comments. We had an honest conversation about what KPOP really means to me and it's positive affects for me. 

He gave me a really positive response and apologized for hurting my feelings. He said he will be respectful of my love of KPOP because it means something to me. I asked him if he was jealous and he did mention a little jealously, but realized it shouldn't mean anything when I'm the one who loves him. We seem to be in a great place and I have to thank all of you here on the subreddit for helping me out and offering me advice.

thank you r/kpop

Sorry for being a bit late, but I was out of the area for a bit post-graduation, but Im back and ready to delve back into this! So welcome to the first Makestar Roundup post of 2018!

**Note:** The Mont Boys (from MixNine) are slated to open a Makestar Project in the next few days. Ill add the project to this thread once their project opens.

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)
	
**[Sonamoo Album Project Part 2](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonamoo2/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 18, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Sonamoo?

Sonamoo is decently known on the sub, so Ill direct people to the groups [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonamoo) for a more in depth look at who they are. Ill give a brief summary below.

Sonamoo is a seven-member girl group under TS Entertainment (making them labelmates of B.A.P). The group debuted in 2014 with the song [Dj vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRY0Dk9avck), which showcased the groups initial image of chic tough girls (ala 2NE1). However, in 2016 the group underwent a complete concept change with the release of [I Like U Too Much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YmVUjBB6Hc), which had the girls embrace the girl next door image. They recently underwent another concept change in 2017, falling into the ""sexy girl-crush"" side of things. Their most recent single ""[I Knew It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9VlCV1ZflQ)"" showcased their new look.

Member Eunjin auditioned for *The Unit*, performing a remixed version of Hyunas ""[Bubble Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWjNTUIDi54)"", where she passed the auditions rounds. As of January 13, 2018 episode, she is #1 in the rankings of *The Unit.*

The group's fandom name is Solbangul (), which means pine cone. This is super cute because Sonamoo () actually means pine tree in Korean. So it's like the fans are the pine cones in the group's pine tree.


**[We Girls Debut Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_wegirls/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 24, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is We Girls?

I literally have not been able to find anything in English about this group outside of their Makestar page. They have an active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wegirls7) page though.

From what I could take from their Makestar, We Girls is a nine member group signed to Aftermoon co. From what someone posted on the sub, one of the members Ji Na (written as Jaina on the Makestar page), is a former member of Bob Girls. 

Doing something completely different from other debut projects, Aftermoon is allowing Starmakers to vote on who becomes the groups center and leader. As of January 15, member Hyeny is winning.


**[Mckay Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonamoo2/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 7, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Mckay?

Mckay Kim is a singer-songwriter from San Diego, California. He is most well known for appearing on K-pop Star Season 2 in 2012, where he was placed in the team Raccoon Boys. The team ended up placing 5th in the competition, and he eventually signed to Dorothy Company. However, he is currently signed to U.P. Music.

He officially debuted in 2015, with the single [Angel 2 Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64vgmNlq84), featuring Filipino-American singer Jeff Bernat.

I cant really find too much else about him, but it seems he hasnt had a proper comeback since 2015. His last single was the song [Month of June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krHshoFGpf4)"".

**[E.O.S (Kim Hyung Joong) Debut 25th Anniversary Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eos/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 7, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is E.O.S?

So theres pretty much nothing in English about this group, but the following is what I could find.

E.O.S was a three member [techno-rock band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQdSJRF5NEc) that debuted in 1993, with Kim Hyung Joong as an original member (and leader) of the group. The group was active from 1993 to 1997, when they disbanded after the release of their third album *Neo Myth of EOS*. After the group disbanded, Hyung Joong sort of disappeared from the industry, making the occasional guest feature on various tracks until the reception of Good Person on Toys 2001 project album convinced him to officially come back and debut as a solo artist. He officially debuted as a solo artist in 2003.

Im assuming Kim Hyung Joong has decided to revive E.O.S in part for the anniversary but also due to seeing how successful revived Gen 1 groups have done in todays market.

Although the other two original members Go Sukyoung and Kangrin are not involved in this project, they have been replaced by Bae YoungJoon (on base) and Cho Samhee (guitar). Their credits include being a former member of 90s group Kona (Bae Youngjoon) and being bandmaster for Epik High (Cho Samhee).

**[T.E.N Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ten/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 15, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is T.E.N?

T.E.N is a collaboration between Korean group RIONFIVE and Chinese production agency IDEAL MEDIA GROUP. 

RionFive debuted in 2014 with the single [Crush on You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvvkBJK1e7Q) and is currently signed to Narda Entertainment. Initially a five-member group, a sixth member (Jonghyun) was added to the groups lineup and made his debut on the groups second single [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqLmbSju98E)"". Their fandom name is ORib, which stands for **O**nly+**Ri**onFive+**B**eauty.

Member Taewoo participated in Produce 101s second season, and placed 49th on the show, being eliminated in Episode 8. 

It seems the T.E.N is made of five members from RionFive (Taewoo, Rohyoon, Yousung, Jeonghyeon, and Minjae) and 5 members from Ideal (Simon, Yonghyun, Liu Yang, Joss Cheng, and Han). It also seems that RionFive original member Kangsan is either on hiatus or is no longer part of the group, as he is the only RF member not involved in T.E.N.  

There is no info on the length of the project group's contracts, but I'm assuming 7 months to a year minimum unless they become very popular. 

**[S.I.S Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 19, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is S.I.S?

So there actually isnt too much written about them in English, but [relevant wikia](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/S.I.S) page.

From what little I could gleam from the internet, S.I.S (which stands for Serendipity in Stars) is a six member girl group signed to XX Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Ive Got a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwx68Z99uk)"". According to their Makestar, the groups image is going for a little sister vibe. They do have a pretty active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sis6girls/) page.

The group auditioned on *The Unit* with a performance of GFriend's ""[Glass Bead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cng6NnsntK0)"", though only 3 members (Anne, Gauel, and Sebin) made it past the audition rounds. Currently, Anne is the only member left on the show, placing 19th as of Episode 12. Gauel was eliminated in Episode 11 and Sebin was eliminated in Episode 7.

The project was initially slated to end December 28, 2017, but got an extension by Makestar.


**[Son Hyo Kyous 1st Concert Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonhyokyou/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 27, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Son Hyo Kyou?

Son Hyo Kyou is a soloist signed to Choon Entertainment.

He debuted in 2015 with the single [White Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r33vwKQ1jvw) and has been releasing at least one digital single a year since. His most recent single was [We Should Have Been Friends]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4rYn77o6Wk) in 2017.

I havent been able to find much else about him in English.

**[Heyne Single Album Project Part 2](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_heyne_02/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 8, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Heyne?

Heyne is a soloist originally signed to Crescendo Music, but is currently at Wellmade Yedang
 (yes, thats actually the labels name).

She debuted in 2013 with the single [Dalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kdzuul6nTA) and her last album *Love Cell* was funded via Makestar (though the page oddly seems to no longer exist on the site). 

According to her Makestar, she has also dabbled in MCing and acting, with a few of her notable activities including MCing Suspicous Show and acting in JTBCs Seonam Girls High School Investigators.


**[AOORA Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_aoora/)**

* Date Project Ends: March 8, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is AOORA?

AOORA is a soloist who is former member of AA (pronounced double A) and is singed to Wellmade Yedang. He debuted in AA with the song  [So Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vXFefnd9x4)"" in 2011. During his time with AA, he also was in a subunit with member Hoik, simply known as AOORA&amp;HOIK. They released the song ""[   (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQxekY0rWqU)"" feat. Taeyeon of the girl group shez. He left AA in 2016 to pursue a solo career.

Hes a rapper and singer, who (I guess) has a reputation for making 19+ solo tracks, has a very active [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/channelAOORA) where he posts new tracks and covers.

 Rank your top ten Albums (Mini/Full) of 2017. #1 gets 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, #3 gets 8 points etc.

 Do not rank the songs in reverse order.

 Upvoting/Downvoting someone else's ranking will not impact the results

 Japanese/Chinese/English language albums are eligible if the artist/group is Korean 

 PLAIN TEXT ONLY - No Bold, Italics, quotations around the song title, etc. 

 All K-Genres are eligible 

 Proper formatting is #. Artist - Album 

 Do not include repackages, 

(they'll be combined with the OG version of the album in the results thread it's easier for me if everyone sticks to the OG version while voting though)



Schedule:

January 16th: Albums of 2017

January 23rd: Side Tracks of 2017

January 30th: Songs of 2017

February 6th: Loona [Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHn28FZHz9hoyaCP9r9uLLXyCnkYTp2cRrJ0vj_k6a0/edit?usp=sharing)

February 13: Super Junior + Super Junior M 

The whole point of the voting was to solve a potential scheduling issue with Loona and future issues however it didn't really work for a few reasons...

There sure is. So, I was wondering if you guys ever hear anything that just really blows you away when youre listening to a song. It can be melodic, vocal, or anything, just any type of cool composition or production. 

Ill start: SNSDs Holiday has a snare in the chorus! Oh My Girls Windy Day has a piano in the buildup of the prechorus, but a poco lento in the postprechorus with accents. Also, theres some type of stringer instrument (harp? muted electric guitar? ukulele?) in the chorus. The final chorus of LOONAs Odd Eye Circles Crazy Sweet Love and the entirety of Girl Front sounds really cool ",42,57

For me, I personally thought Hyuna's Lip and Hip's bridge was quite shocking. The bridge sounds like as if another artist was singing it. The Hyuna of yore sang in a much less nasally voice evidenced by Bubble Pop and Change. Of course, that changed with Red and the following songs after. That bridge just for some reason, gave me nostalgic feelings.

Consider, for example, this [OMG comeback stage](https://youtu.be/8HlntKe5Gro), where the roar of the crowd makes the atmosphere less Secret Garden than Soccer Stadium.

Of course, a vocal audience can often add an exciting energy to a performance, but this was one of those occasions where I found the fanchanting unenchanting.

Prime example is Sehun being chased by an SM casting director for 30 minutes and Pledis casting agents in Busan throwing away their umbrella on a rainy day after they spotted Nu'est's Ren in order to rush after him.

Recently, The Boyz's leader [Sangyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tf_ODIXt0M) revealed that he was street cast outside his school solely based on his *side profile* which is why his company still tries to make his side profile the centre of attention in all his solo shots.

Sometimes, what comes after the street casting is funnier. Seventeen's Mingyu was cast after he left school to escape cleaning. He then sang the national anthem and a did a clapping dance he learnt at church wearing flip flops for the audition and got accepted anyway. Cube's Yoo Seonho was street cast at a youth arts festival. He was supposed to dance EXO's Growl for his audition but froze and just stood and stared at the judges and got through despite thinking he failed.

What are some of your favourite street casting stories?",80,129

A: R/Kpop Sings is the awesome new community project we're running. Inspired by r/anime sings, the subreddit will come together to choose and cover a kpop song! Here's our [debut song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4GIiYuzVQ) so you can see what the project will look like. Once the next song is selected, I'll make another post detailing how to submit your singing. ANYONE CAN SING.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Can I still nominate a song if I don't plan on singing?**

A: *Heck yes you can*. This is a community project; anyone and everyone can nominate and vote on songs, and *ANYONE CAN SING*! Even if you don't plan on singing, you still get a say in what WE sing, so nominate whatever you think we'll be awesome at (or terrible at!! up to you!!)

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: What songs can I nominate?**

A: Any song by a Kpop artist. Loose definition here. Anything glaringly out of line will be ignored.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: How many songs can I nominate?**

A: Go crazy, son. Nominate as many as you like.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Can I be a part of the singing????**

A: Yes. See above, be patient :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: When will this form close?**

A: Nominations will close SUNDAY the 21st at MIDNIGHT CST (or around there, roughly. I'm human.) Voting will being WEDNESDAY the 24th.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Who is running this project?**

A: /u/illlllllli passed the administration reigns to me after the first project, and I have assembled 10 amazing volunteers from the community stationed all across the globe who have bravely offered their time and energy to slaving over timing and pitch correction. Please give them a hand and a hug next time you see them, and thank you to everyone who volunteered!

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Can I nominate [Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7x1HC0bShw)?**

A: Totally!

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Will yall sing it?**

A: Nope!

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Are you guys still accepting singers?? How do I audition, I really want to be a part of the--**

A: If I hear this question from one more person, I will answer you politely and then personally make sure your submission never makes it to the editing deck :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: I have another question not covered here!**

A: Hit up my DMs.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks again to the mods, our editing team, and everyone who has shown interest and excitement in this project! [We're gonna have a good time.](https://gfycat.com/FairIllLeech)",55,57

1404,2018-01-18,2018,1,18,9,7r5jd0,What news are we really looking for?,VallasC,1516233646,"So, like every community, R/K-pop is constantly complaining about which news sources are credible / not as well as why certain news outlets are even covering what they do. There's something about K-Pop news that is being treated like a gimmick and that can either be well treated or off-putting.

My question to the community is, aside from breaking news, what kind of media coverage are we looking for from western writers? There's tons of interested young journalists covering the topic; what should they be providing for us?

Right now I see it broken down into three ways.

""Top 10 blank thing about blank topic regarding K-pop.""

""These are some K-pop boys/girl groups. Here's a couple things about them you might not know unless you're into K-pop.""

""Here's a brief summary of Americanized news about a current K-pop thing so you'll understand.""


Me personally, I'd much rather like in depth character studies of groups, breakdowns of their position in the overall industry or comparisons to their companions of other generations. I'd also be interested in reading about topics that highlight the importance of impact of specific groups/idols in K-pop and worldwide pop culture.

What do you guys think?",94,83

Note: Most songs from idol groups reach their peak positions on digital music charts within the first few days of release. With BBoom BBoom, these peak positions have happened within the past couple days. It has actually only recently landed on all 6 realtime charts at once. So the peak positions on this post are likely not the final peak positions of BBoom BBoom's run on the charts. It may enter Melon top 50 soon.

Like holy shit seriously! Just recently I listened to their You &amp; Me mini album and I had a mini heart attack. When I was listening to J.Seph and Jiwoo's version of Trust Me I was thinking just how beautiful the song was. And then came the BM and Somin's version. I teared up. I love their consept so much, and truly wish they'll stick to it. I prefer the darker KARD, as I'm personally not too into the tropical consept. You In Me MV left me speechless ~~as did BM he's ridiculously gorgeous~~. I love how dark, twisted, and bold it was. KARD is now without a doubt in my top three favorite groups.

The other one is BLACKPINK! They've slowly but surely made their way into my radar, and I'm super interested in seeing what they'll come up in the future! I love Ros's vocals as well as her personality. YG **needs** to give them a proper comeback (a full album, please!). Why on earth is he wasting them like this???

I also want to give a shoutout to Sonamoo's I (Knew It)! I love the song and instantly added it to my playlist. I'm starting to really like Sonamoo as a group.

What groups and songs have you been into lately? Give a shoutout to your newly found favorites!",194,58

I'm also assuming the judges are high-up industry officials and 1st/2nd gen Idols. 

*Edit* : For girls, a lot of you are saying Seulgi, and now that I look back on it, I can't really disagree with you guys. I'll still keep my original answer up but I think Seulgi is a really great answer as well. 

For girls: Jennie Kim(BLACKPINK)
To me, she is the definition of ""Triple Threat"", meaning she excels at singing, rapping, and dancing. Not only that, she's extremely gorgeous and has a strong leadership quality to her. While there are many Idols who do better in certain areas than her, I do not believe there is anyone who has the overall package that she does.  I think this ""flexible"" quality makes her the most valuable contestant. You could put her in any situation or concept, and she would do well. 

Girl Runner-Ups: Somi(JYP), Wendy(Red Velvet), Hani(EXID), Nayeon(TWICE)

For boys: Jungkook(BTS)
Pretty much for the same reasons that I picked Jennie. He can sing, dance, and rap. Now that I think about it, I could just copy and paste my reasons above here word for word lol.

Boy Runner-Ups: Baekhyun(EXO), Mino(WINNER), ZICO(BLOCK B), V(BTS)

1534,2018-01-19,2018,1,19,12,7rfk65,Favorite Concept Albums,bluemysteric,1516333066,"So right off the bat: I realize this might get confusing for folks because of the use of ""concept"" in the K-pop world, but I'm gonna try to explain this the best I can to achieve the discussion I'd like to have with y'all.

I'm working on some writings about SHINee Jonghyun's work and it got me thinking about concept albums. I studied this only briefly in high school (as a part of an English class too, no less), and it's always fascinated me, so I'd like to talk about it in this world. For those who don't know: a ""concept album"" is **an album that's cohesive due to a particular theme (which includes genre/instrumentals, lyrics) or narrative (again, lyrics).**

Jonghyun's *She Is* album I would consider a concept album because it's an album about [someone picturing, finding, and having love](http://fyjjong.tumblr.com/post/144797434558/she-is-showcase-3pm-160523-in-explaining). It's not necessarily Jjong himself but rather a character that's an extension of himself, so I think of it as one 9-track story about a cornball falling in love in that character's own way. The instrumentals don't stray too far from each other (mostly R&amp;B, funk, blues/country variations), and the storytelling starts from seeing the person of affection (""She Is"") and ends with (presumably) marriage and the consummation (   ) (""Suit Up"").

Another concept album that I've previously talked about on here and that i adore is NU'EST's *Canvas* mini, where each song includes mention of art in some form (paintings, brushes, paint, canvases, etc.) and goes through an entire day of love. ""Daybreak"" is exactly that, when the sun comes up, followed by the rest of the parts of the day until the night with ""Look"" (not to mention the song titles all include the parts of the day as well). Much like *She Is*, the instrumentals are cohesive and actually maintain the same energy (I could argue the least energetic would be ""Thank You"" but it still packs a bit of a punch; it's not too out of the blue) while at the same time showcasing the appropriate energy for the time of day.

EXO-CBX's *Hey Mama* mini is also a favorite as it combines all my comments about *She Is* and *Canvas*, and it's just an overall funky-ass album. *Hey Mama* I would say actually surpasses *Canvas* in a way because it really does maintain the SAME energy throughout, and the lyrical story is similar to *She Is* where we start with seeing someone to fall in love with (""The One"") to some kind of commitment (""Cherish"").

So, your turn! What are some of your favorite Korean concept albums? Or if you're curious if an album is or isn't a concept album, you can also comment here and someone else can help decipher.",36,56

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment

Some things to consider..

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2. for the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style, version of whatever song.

4. Because this has occurred before... if I don't reply back to you is because I'm tired of writing back to people that the song you requested has already been translated and I found it in 5s using google. If there is previously translated lyrics thats hard to understand, give me a link so I know at least you looked and I'll judge it it warrants a better translation.

I will be back in 48 hours to check! = P",19,18

The highest rated song was **IUs Jam Jam** with a score of **9.23!** Congrats IU!

IU really shook up the chart with Jam Jam: she is the first artist to get a Certified All-Kill in 2018, the artist with the 2nd highest rated song of all time, the first soloist to get a CAK, and one of five artists to score a CAK! She dominates the iChart and Koreas charts, but she dominates r/kpops Jukebox Charts as well, congrats IU! (For more information on what a Certified All-Kill is on the Jukebox Chart, [please read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_what.27s_an_.22all-kill.22_on_the_jukebox.3F))

Hey HEY __HEY__, do you think the pretty girls are AOA? First Love or Amor Fati, do you speak love? Give Me the Love? Hmmm. Thats all for this week, enjoy listening!

And you don't really have to do each &amp; every era if you don't have one.

* [Push Push @ Music Bank 2010.06.04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S01c5rgtWg). Not only because it's their debut stage, but also because of their rookie vocals.

* [Shady Girl @ Music Core 2010.09.11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUOuvlEKzc4). It's totally because of Dasom dropping the microphone cutely.

* -I don't have one for How Dare You-

* [So Cool @ M COUNTDOWN 2011.08.11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OhlWKwJRNQ). I think it's this stage since nothing else is coming to mind. Also, it created this surprise [Bora gif](https://imgur.com/a/h0rYx) lol.

* [Alone @ Music Core 2012.12.29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eLPo6D9qAA). Leather outfits from MV, check.

* [Loving U @ Music Core 2012.12.29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s0SK-4_Y4s). This isn't a live stage, but it's still easily a favorite of mine from this era. The sailor outfits with the water and boats in the back were perfect.

* [Give It To Me (remix) @ KBS Gayo Daejun 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCnCwtVCr_A). I more or less love all of the performances this era equally, but I'll go with this.

* [Touch My Body @ Inkigayo 2014.07.27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaLzN-NK-ME). They were dancing on a purposely wet stage.

* [I Swear @ Music Core 2014.09.06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttpOWQIZuw). I just love that they're performing it outside. A lot of the times if a group is performing outside where it's bright, I'll enjoy it. *But* even with that outside ""plus"" from me, I'm once again not 100% on if it's my no.1 since I love most of the performances this era.

* [SHAKE IT @ Show Music core 2015.08.01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH3ARhmBf8E). This is mainly because of the fanchants from the crowd. I believe most of the groups who performed that day had really loud ones as well.

* [I Like That @ SBS Gayo Daejun 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM9hgG4TB18). Their expressions aren't really charismatic lol, which I feel is because of getting such little time at the show despite being there way early/an older group. But it really fits the song. The black outfits and the red petals or confetti falling at the end are amazing. It's too bad they didn't film just a few seconds more... The fantakens from this day were beautiful! 

* [LONELY @ Inkigayo 2017.06.04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZgqD7bMmE0). Since it's on their debut date... And they were standing for this, unlike the other 3 stages.",76,135

Most of the time it just makes things slightly more sedate/frenetic based on whatever speed I've chosen. Sometimes, though, it brings out interesting qualities in songs I already loved. I think [Closer](https://youtu.be/isUudT58Xfk) at 1.25 speed is my favorite example of this. Not only does it feel something like a dance remix of the song, it made me notice some interesting things in the beat too. Namely there's a fairly steady drum beat that drops out every so often during the verses.

I'd like to do a giveaway for Jonghyun's upcoming album. Personally for me, although he is one of my favorite vocalists in k-pop, I'd rather have the albums be sent to somebody that would appreciate it more. I'll do my best to keep this open worldwide, but please only enter if you haven't ordered it yourself. I'll have the albums shipped straight to you from a reputable seller (Hanteo chart counted). There will be multiple winners. Names will be drawn randomly.

 I'll keep the form open for roughly half a day starting now.

1809,2018-01-22,2018,1,22,22,7s5ljx,[Fanaccount] KARD-Wild KARD Asia Tour(Singapore leg) 2017,sjzxc,1516626170,"It has been a day since KARD's concert and, I'm writing this to share with all of you what amazing and super fun night I had yesterday.

* The concert was held on 21st January at mall called Bigbox. I left my house around 2.30pm and arrived at the mall at 3.50,since they had different timings of when different queue numbers could enter the waiting area. 3101 to 3200 could only enter at 4 and my queue number was 3149 and so on and so forth yall get the idea. There were also 3 different categories tickets, Ultimate KARD which was 238 which included a Hi-Touch&amp; a group photo, Wild KARD which was 168 which only had a Hi-Touch and lastly general admission which was 88. I bought the general admission ticket since this my first time attending a concert ever and I didn't know what to expect. There were also a couple of fansites selling photocards,stickers and things like that. There was this fansite which was giving out really nice posters to the first 500 people who came to claimed them and [I got one !!](https://imgur.com/IMICf8v). One thing to note that this was a standing concert so absolutely no chairs at all even for the higher category tickets,so the people who bought the earlier had the advantage. So since i bought my tickets on the day they released, i was quite near the front. So after i got admitted into the waiting area,i waited for about 2 hours before the doors opened at 6.30. 
* So at 6.30 the doors promptly opened and i went in and got a spot right at the front of my area. The floor was divided into 3 different sections, with Ultimate KARD being **right** infront of the stage, wild kard slightly behind and general admission behind them. It was still quite near the stage and I was standing at the front so I had a really good and clear view of the stage. At 7.00 they started playing KARD songs and the crowd went wild with lots of singing, screaming and cheering. 
* Finally the time arrived and the first song they performed was [into you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kifKTQ_fQU) and it was amazing. The moment they appeared the crowd went nuts, everyone was screaming like mad. When i saw them on stage i could hardly believe my eyes holy shit. Jiwoo and Somin looked extremely beautiful and Bm and J.seph looked hella fine. When the song started everyone sang at the top of their lungs and the noise was deafening, you can't really tell from the videos cos it was taken from a Ultimate KARD's point of view. The vocals were extremely on point they sound exactly like how they sound on Spotify or in their youtube MVs. You could also tell BM really really loves performing in front of his fans, since during into you when he was dancing he was giving it his 200%, his movements were as if he were really into it, not saying the other members didn't give it their all but Bm's movement were super energetic and it stands out since he was so freaking tall.After that they performed [you in me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wimjqYWwIp0) and you could tell this song was crowd favourite since everyone was literally shouting the lyrics. At this time I was super pumped up so I was basically singing at the top of lungs and waving my banner like a mad man HAHAH.
* After that they performed [trust me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVPPrFp6Igo),[don't recall](
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTAwKRrW8Y&amp;t=91s) and [Rumor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEqbzd0UIs8&amp;t=89s).I really liked the trust me performance, since you could hear Jiwoo's voice super clearly and he voice is super unique sound to it which i can't describe but it sounds so so so good live also Somin's vocals oh my god,her voice is so delicate and pleasant plus she seems to hit the high notes so effortlessly.
* Then they had a Q&amp;A session, so basically there was a board outside the waiting area where people could write questions on post-its that they wanted to ask KARD. So they played scissors,paper stone to decide the order and the order was Jiwoo,J.seph,Somin,BM and i'll link the [Q&amp;A video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXSxHCLr6LU). One thing i want to say that struck me most was how fluent Bm is in english, i know that he was raised in LA and all but after moving to Korean he probably dosen't have much chance to practice english. Yet at the concert yesterday he spoke English through out the whole event and even when he spoke in Korean he translated it himself and told us what he said in English,so that's something I find quite amazing really.
* Now moving on to the special stages, this stages were something really. They exceptional and it really blew me away the vocal ranges they all have and I guess that is what makes KARD so special, since they have such a diverse range of voices they can make lots of different type of music. So first up was Jiwoo and she performed [Really Really by Winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-vUEhpG5es)and the crowd went mental, everyone was singing along and it so full of good vibes. Whats also amazing is the fact that she sang the whole song herself rap parts included, she also said that BM gave her advice on the rap parts and that is one of benefits of being into a co-ed group. I really loved this cover since it sounds so different but really enjoyable to listen to at the same time. It also shows how unique Jiwoo's voice is since she sing and rap i guess.
* Next up was [J.seph solo stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Yp0OCA188) and holy shit, that performance was out of this word. Apparently this song is written by J.seph himself and the beat is something he really liked every since he was trainee but he only had time to use this beat to make a song recently. Let me tell you this song was something else,it showcased how good he is at the slow rapping style as opposed  to Bm's super hard style. I really hope this song gets released since its such a bop and that really smooth and calming r&amp;b sound.
* Next up was [Somin's stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3mDV4jrLPw) and this stage blew me away literally, like it was **fucking amazing**. She covered Tayeon's fine and i really wasn't expecting that,she looked like an angel in that dress and etheral. When she started singing i nearly died she managed to hit the high note so effortlessly and it honestly such a beautiful cover, her vocals are top notch really. It was such breathtaking performance ,you could really hear the emotion and honestly it was just beautiful.
* Now it was Bm's turn and he performed [living good pt2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc4Q2iMfOp0). Oh boy did he really bring the energy and swag, he basically hyped up the crowd and when he rapped boy did he go in hard. Everyone was basically bopping along and it a super fun performace. I really loves BM's rapping especially when he allowed to go hard with a mixture of english and korean. To put it simply the performance was lit no other words better to describe the whole thing.
* They then did a cover of [side to side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arr2YKjppfk) and oh my lord seeing Jiwoo and Somin in those shorts was something else(I'm not sexualizing them but i don't really know how else to describe it). I guess another benefit of being in a co ed group allows them to performing this type and songs and put their own spin on it as Bm and J.seph came in halfway and rapped. They then did a cover of [24K magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0TDm1P4YYE&amp;t=2s) and the crowd loved it,the energy was through the roof at this time, my voice had gotten hoarse from all the shouting and screaming but whocares right.After that they proceeded to a [lucky draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrbLiLw0XyA)
* Then they performed [push and pull as well as hola hola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFR6hHNA0ys&amp;t=4s) and the crowd went crazy. I know i said the crowd went crazy alot of time, but this was the craziest and hyper. Everyone was jumping with their hands especially during hola hola kinnda live a rave, you could hear everyone singing at the top of their lungs, people were shouting. I was basically screaming/singing my voice to extinction at this point of time,i was jumping and dancing pumping my hands up and down all while waving my poster like some crazy person. When that ended they said their closing thoughts and how they felt etc,which unfortunately i can't find a video off,when that ended went backstage and the crowd went fucking nuts screaming for an encore.
* Guess what they actually gave an encore performance of [oh na na and living good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpysnIXitU&amp;t=1s). It wasn't supposed to happen since the concert would at end at 9 and the hi-touch and phototaking would start. At this point the crowd's energy had reached its peak and everyone was super pumped, so during oh na na when BM told people to start jumping. The whole place went crazy, everyone was having a supergood time bouncing/jumping along to the music,singing with so much gusto. It was super amazing to witness really towards the end it was more rave than a kpop concert and all thanks to BM his energy is super infectious and he really knows to hype up a crowd. After that the concert ended and the Hi-touch and photo taking started. 


**Closing thoughts** I honestly had unbelievable,thrilling ,extraordinary, phenomenal time. I can't express in words how much last night meant to me, to put it super bluntly i had a fucking amazing time. Being so many like minded fans singing your favourite groups songs at the top of your voice and not giving a shit and with no one to judge you, its just such an out of the world experience really. My words and fan cams can only convey the feeling so much but as i can't really put into the words the great time i had. Hearing BM's hard as fuck raps, J.seph slow style of rapping and of course Jiwoo and Somin's extraordinary vocals is something forever etched in my mind. I'm gonna suffer from Post Concert Depression for the next few days but thats the price you pay for seeing something so amazing life. I also everyone gets to go to their favourite singer/group concert once in their life because it is experience that you'll never forget I promise you",9,74

It could be anything kpop related e.g. songs, albums, fave concepts etc.

Like with most forms of interest, things become less and less surprising as you get exposed and venture into a certain topic, especially in kpop where fans are teased consistent previews as a norm. ***So what would you have liked to experience without any form of background or expectations?***



I suppose a reasonable answer would be to just list all your favourite kpop things, but if you can try and limit it to the few which you think would be ***the best*** experience for you.

***

Here's a few of mine:

**Album:** [Odd Eye Circle - Max &amp; Match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IOy5QBwdXo&amp;t=147s)

Having already heard high quality LOONA releases and Mix &amp; Match (and also the album preview) - I already knew this was going to be a great listen. 

So I think hearing this well produced electronic record for the 1st time without any exposure of LOONA will surely be an insane dopamine rush for me since it's the exact type music I want to hear.

**Song:** [Red Velvet - Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD0kPiizEOU)

I think hearing this godsend gem (or any other Perfect Velvet Tracks tbh) out of knowhere will blow my mind. But then again on the flipside seeing Red Velvet's
 musical progression towards their latest record is also very gratifying.

**Video:** [K Will - Please Don't...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdUiCJnRptk)

It will be too ironic if I elaborate any further, just watch it without any context if you haven't already!",72,88

I am genuinely conflicted over how some solo idol projects are so widely received while others fall through the cracks.   
It couldn't possibly be just a disparity in individual popularity within a group or possibly bad marketing by the company.   
There must be a deeper answer. Is it a reflection of the consumers? 

How do we let amazing solo projects like Yugyeom's [""I Don't Know""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MhvjezDZD0) slip through the cracks while others take off? Help me r/ kpop! 

Also, while you're at it - what solo projects do you enjoy and why do you think they are or aren't popular? ",37,59

So, out of all the boy groups and girl groups that I have listened to; these two groups stick out as groups I can't seem to enjoy, until much later.

MONSTA X is one boy group that took me a while for me to warm up to them.

I didn't understand; I love EXO, so naturally I would fall for MONSTA X.

Now, I totally love them a lot.

For a girl group, GFriend took a long time for me.

I love the cute concept too, but this girl group took a while to click with me.

It was only until Love Whisper and Fingertip that sealed the deal and made me love the group.

How about you?",82,29

2039,2018-01-25,2018,1,25,1,7so2hb,Which recently debuted group do you think will become industry greats? (2016-2017 rookies),djdjowgjmbs,1516809815,"2016-2017 has seen some amazing debuts - standards have gotten so high for Kpop groups these days that most debuts being put out are of relatively good quality and choreography only seems to be getting better. However, just for a fun discussion, out of all these groups, which ones do you see getting big in the future? (among the 2016-2017 rookies?)

I'm basing my views obviously on personal bias, but also on the Korean/international fandom the group already has. I'm also excluding groups that either haven't debuted yet or don't have pre-debut activities as a group (SM and JYP's new girl group for example)

Boy Groups: I see NCT and Astro becoming bigger than they are right now. As for more recent debuts, there are already predictions that Stray Kids and The Boyz will become *the* rookies of 2018 (they were recently seen at Lotte World together and [both](https://twitter.com/leeminhoarchive/status/955682772441583616) [fandoms]
(https://twitter.com/HYUNJINlSM/status/955677136345432064) freaked out. Moroever, certain outlets have already predicted that they'll be the top rookie groups of this [year](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/01/hana-financial-group-releases-an-analysis-for-prospective-k-pop-scenes-predicting-the-top-two-rookies-of-2018). I'd add some of the Wanna One spin off groups, but I don't really know how they're going to do.

Girl Groups: Black Pink is a given. Their presence far exceeds the short time they've been out since debut. If they play their cards right, Loona can become quite popular - especially considering both their members on Mix Nine (Hyunjin, Heejin) are doing very well and are pretty much set to debut in the final group. With girl groups though, big three groups still seem to dominate while the field is more varied with the boys. 

Anyway, who among the rookies of these past two years do you think has the most potential to be successful in 5 years time? ",172,91

I just recently read a post on PannChoa by a PannChoa denizen who is an international fan that talked about meeting an idol ""out in the wild"" and was ignored by them. The fan stated they felt left out and wondered if they were Korean if the idol would have acknowledged them and talked about how idol groups treat their Korean and International fans differently. How, even at overseas events the idols are still posting messages on the fancafes for their Korean fans and apologizing for being overseas.

For me personally (as an i-fan), I have no expectations of how an idol will treat me and I always expect Korean fans to be put first because these are Korean idols. I just feel privileged that idols even come to where I live to have concerts and I can go see them. I don't blame the OP of that post for feeling left out, but it just reminds me to remind myself of my boundaries as an international fan and fangirl. I do believe the idol in question they were talking about that ignored them, would have done the same thing if they were Korean fans too, so I don't really believe it's because they were international fans they got ignored. But I just wanted to approach the subject and see other people's opinions on it. Do you personally feel left out as an international fan and do you believe that K-Pop groups/companies should find ways to make their i-fans feel more included? Do you believe that idol groups do treat their K-fans and I-fans differently and do you think that's unfair?",157,56

**Please note: you will need a google/gmail account to vote. This is to prevent people spamming votes for their songs, which the nominations showed as a definite problem. EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE NOT BEING RECORDED, I PROMISE.**

&amp;nbsp;

**VOTING WILL CLOSE ON JANUARY 31st**

I've compiled all your songs into one giant master list of nominations. Each account will get **FIVE** votes towards the song that you think would be fun for r/kpop to sing. If you're just emerging from your rock, the debut track is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4GIiYuzVQ) and I put together a nice little Q&amp;A [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7r38ct/song_nominations_now_open_for_rkpop_sings_2nd/).


&amp;nbsp;

**Some fun facts and highlights from the nominations process:**

* There were **517** total nominations (yes, I went through them all, you're welcome, I love you too.)
* Of those nominations, roughly **100** were direct, properly formatted duplicates.
* There were roughly **250** unique songs nominated.
* **R/Kpop will not be winning a reading comprehension award this year.**
* **Tears** was nominated 19 times because of course it was.
* **Shinee** was the artist most submitted, with 11 songs submitted in 30+ different spellings and variations. 
* **Twice** is the most prolific of submissions, with every single one of their Korean releases nominated.
* There were a ton of horribly formatted submissions, **editor's choice** is [this adorable person](https://i.imgur.com/4VbUyOV.png) who caught their mistake but didn't manage to effectively rectify it. 
* Troll responses were of course represented, we are again advised against singing Wee Woo at any cost. To the person who sent in the hate message, I hope you're doing alright and if you want to talk, please PM me.

&amp;nbsp;

**WHOA HANG ON MY SONG ISN'T THERE WHAT THE HECK**

I know, and I'm sorry. First off, *I'm only human*. If a glaring omission is found (like if I forgot something like *Mirotic*) let me know, it was probably an accident. If you submitted a super obscure song, it was probably also an accident but I'm a lot less likely to fix it because let's be honest, no one was going to vote for it. Sorry bae. 

A few other songs were omitted at the discretion of the editing team, notably songs that are **excruciatingly rap-heavy**. Our editing team is working together for the first time and unanimously agreed that trying to figure out the beginnings of a system that works for us while having to edit tiny details in hours of poorly recorded rapping would be a living nightmare, and we hope you can respect that. If I missed an especially rap heavy song and it is climbing the charts, **I will take it out.**

Unfortunately, this includes the **Stray Kidz** songs. I know a handful of yall were very passionate about them, and I do apologize. Once we get our editing system fine tuned (and tbh once they debut) we will happily include them in voting and we look forward to yall's amazing rapping. 

Also Tears is not going to ever be an official selection, but if you're determined to sing it, I'm not stopping you. Live your dream. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

As always, PM me with dumb questions. Thanks again to the mods, our editing team, and everyone who has shown interest and excitement in this project. Let's get [funky](https://gfycat.com/MixedDigitalLaughingthrush).",34,64

Anyway, let's talk about the best choreography of this past year! Im talking singles, side tracks, special stages, concert performances, performances from survival shows, short sections of individual routines, etc etc. Anything that stood out to you, and why. As a former dancer and as someone who got into kpop because of the dance routines in the first place, Im always up for a good dance discussion and finding new routines or appreciating old ones in a new way.


I tried not to go overboard (lol still did), so I tackled singles and limited myself to 5:


* **[My First and Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Opsx733bfg) (NCT Dream)** - Tony Testa does it again. From the beginning, this routine is like a sprint. Its extremely aerobic, chock full of big movements, floor work, and barely a moment to rest. This routine has a youthful vibe simply because of how frantic it is, how much they move, bounce, and get up and down to the floor. Speaking of, the amount of floor work alone in this routine is actually ridiculous, and I mean that in a good way. The amount of hand and foot detail in this piece is also great, but thats pretty characteristic for Testa. Plus there are so many good teamwork/formation moments ugh, like when [Haechan is at the front where everyone creates the visual reminiscent of a Hindu god](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=31s) to when [Mark is center](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=40s) to when they [swing Haechan](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=1m52s) to the [circle-&gt;star](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=2m36s) on the floor (tbh Im still a bit like wtf Tony, why did you have to put something that unnecessarily hard in this), to even something as simple and quick as [this](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=2m57s) ripple/canon/peel. I would also be remiss not to mention the [team death drop](https://youtu.be/1Opsx733bfg?t=2m29s). This routine is clever and draining and *hard*, so props to NCT Dream for pulling it off so well.  

* **[Clap](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=1m39s) (SVT)** - floor work! levels! ripples! Everything I love in the first 20 seconds. This routine is super playful and cheeky, almost risky at times. [Look at this drop](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=3m55s). I love that Seventeen isnt afraid to jump and fall and generally do really difficult moves in their routines. Most other groups I feel like do difficult things, yes, but its usually floor work or footwork or isolations. But, Seventeen! They seem to do a lot more jumping and falling (and squatting lol) than I recall other groups doing, and it works for them. Seventeen does a really great job of meshing to move like one single unit and I think thats why deviations have so much punch for them (like 1 person popping up to sing, which happens a lot in the first minute of the routine but persists all through). Other favorite moments include the [kick-clap floor work in the beginning](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=1m59s), [this collective foot tapping](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=2m27s), the [groove forward](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=2m51s) when Vernon is in center, and the [fast sequence followed by slow groove with shoulder isolations](https://youtu.be/K_qlkKYL-54?t=3m38s).

* **[DamDaDi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlT4by4EGFw) (Golden Child)** - reminds me a lot of a musical theater routine with the big showy movements, the acting, and the fast clip. In that vein, it also reminds me a lot of early Seventeen. I love the balance between big movements and subtlety, and the breaks from the frantic pace to just groove. It gives the routine room to breathe. ALSO, there is a shit ton of footwork and detailed leg movement in this routine and I appreciate that. I see you, GolCha. I see you.

* **[Lilili Yabbay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFOENscJfPI) (SVT Perf. Unit)** - I didnt fully appreciate this til I saw the [E2W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOKr0_aDH9c) dance cover of it. Shit, the amount of teamwork in this is insane. I would list examples, but its almost the entire first minute of this routine. I think their movement caters to the song very well, as its more subdued during the quiet intro and verses and very harsh and big at the peaks, but the slow moments punctuated with small movements in the silence punctuates both the music and the subtle movements. Like after the sequence of big moves 0:53-1:09 and then the sloooow following the pop when Dino is at the front ~1:10. For small isolated moments, I love it when they [push the leg of the person in front of them](https://youtu.be/SFOENscJfPI?t=1m27s). Its so small that you could easily miss it. The floor work is also extremely detailed and interesting. This is like a lite version of an actual contemporary routine. I spot something new every time I watch this, which I think it what makes it so great.

* **[Cherry Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMIcMrEuS-Q) (NCT 127)** - Tony Testa does it *again*. The fact that this didnt win any dance awards is the greatest injustice of award show season 2k17, in my opinion. While writing this, I had to watch the dance practice several times before I could even articulate *why* its so good because it just leaves me in awe. I guess its because watching this piece makes it feel like the dance and the music actually bleed together. The movements are erratic and strange at times, but there is a calm precision to the execution that makes it work. The formations may seem a bit scattered and unorganized at first, but they lend themselves to the feeling that the dancers are one moving organism. There are many moments in this routine remind me A LOT of a modern piece, starting from when [Jaehyun comes forward with the exaggerated arm movement](https://youtu.be/IMIcMrEuS-Q?t=22s) to the [unison moving hops in the background](https://youtu.be/IMIcMrEuS-Q?t=53s), [more hops in the background](https://youtu.be/IMIcMrEuS-Q?t=1m51s), and when everyone [melts to the ground and then holds a pose](https://youtu.be/IMIcMrEuS-Q?t=2m39s). I also love the levels/movements in the round in [this formation in the background](https://youtu.be/IMIcMrEuS-Q?t=1m58s) behind Haechan. Its like Cherry Bomb is what you get when you mix modern and hiphop. And, the breakdown (at 2:59). Do I even need to mention the breakdown? Im also in awe of the isolations and jumps they do at the *end* of a piece thats this challenging. This routine melts my face off and I mean that in a good way. 

There were more great routines, but I tried to leave some for other people to discuss. And even if I talked about something you wanted to mention, feel free to give your thoughts on it. Its always great to find new perspectives and appreciation on something Ive already seen.

For me, it was f(x) Krystal. I always hear people talking about her cold persona, but I later came to love her personality. There's just something quirky about her that I personally dig. She's so real about things, and I notice that a lot of those supposingly ""rude"" actions of hers are due to her shy and quiet personality, which I can relate.

They are real people and are human just like everyone else. They can be angry or jealous or immature or just plain rude like everyone else. Being an idol is a job and many have stage personas they wear and show to the fans. Additionally, we only glimpse a part of their life when they are working so its impossible to tell how they are in real life because we don't know them personally. But just like and support our favs from what we do know of them. And you can still love your bias while acknowledging their faults. 

I was reading a thread about how a specific idol is always seen as angelic and perfect because of how he looks but he's actually very petty and can be shady in real life. But people have this preconceived notion of him being the sweetest, fluffiest person ever so they either tend to miss this or just ignore certain parts of his personality altogether in order for him to fit into their perception of him. So are there other idols who have traits that the general fandom ignores or the general public tends to miss that it feels like only certain parts of your fandom ever acknowledge? ",47,19

I have been going through some strange emotions as a fan in recent days lol. It's a mixture of overwhelm and being thankful. As you might know, iKon came back yesterday and they're #1 on Melon right now. And this is after months of being called 'flops' and being reduced to 'try hard' when they were just doing the type of music they wanted to. People were already calling them shit like this but then their last cb did tank so it was worse. As a fan, I couldn't say much. Their last cb DID flop on charts and that matters to them and their company. B.I kept talking about how he feels as though he's aged, that he's not going to check his phone, will delete all streaming apps etc. His lack of confidence pained me because anyone who cared to know him would know that he's a genius...for him to feel incompetent and nervous made me feel really sad. I was/am SO nervous for this album.

BUT NOW. The boys are happy. Even if they didn't top the charts (though they did), they're surrounded with good people. BIGBANG and WINNER who always support and promote their junior group. PSY and Tablo who recognise B.I and mentor the group as best as they can. Their new stylist who calls them 'kids' and loves them a lot. Their dancers who are their best friends and talked about how they dreamed iKon would get #1. (This thing made me cry sm.) Suhyun who's showing support too. And all the producers and lyricists they worked with talking about how good iKon are and how much they love and trust their new song.

When Love Scenario hit #1, they all posted a screenshot on Instagram as a sigh of relief. They all said that somehow its more meaningful than My Type getting #1. To me, watching iKon and looking at how many people love them and are rooting for them is rewarding.

I'm also a WINNER fan and these were the same emotions I felt when everyone cried when WINNER hit #1 with Really Really on Melon last year. Also when people keep saying how WINNER deserves recognition for their achievement in 2017. That is more rewarding for me than anything else. When non-fans recognise them and love their songs. The boys are really humbled by the hate they get and by YG himself so it's nice to see them being backed by the public.

So what has been the most rewarding moment for you as a fan?",68,75

2280,2018-01-26,2018,1,26,21,7t47tm,I met Sandara Park at Thailand's Emquartier today.,MrCake777,1516970048,"Link: https://imgur.com/gallery/0c2qk

Today I was at Emquartier which is one of Thailand's most famous department store with my friends. 

I was looking around with my friends when group of Koreans passed us (Which I assume that its her friends) One of my friends named Time went ""Oh shit, isn't that Sandara Park?"" I looked and thought ""Oh yeah, maybe?"" But none of us were sure if she was and we were to scared to ask. We had no choice but to follow her around. 

After following her around for quite amount of time and being too scared to ask, my friend named Navi searched up her IG and looked at her most recent photo. She had the exact same outfit as in the photo I took with her. 

I was completely sure that it was her, I went up to her and asked her ""Aren't you Sandara Park?"" in Korean while showing her IG photo. She was. I went ""Oh really? For real?"" then burst out an uncontrollable laughter of happiness. 

I then ssked her if I could take a picture with her. She said sure, and her friends were asking whats the deal. She went 'Oh I think this student here is Korean, and he wants to take a picture with me.' Then my friend Shiva took a photo of her and me together. I was so nervous and just went 'Thank you!' (In Korean still) and just ran away. 

As I ran away, I went 'HOLY F*CK YEAH IT'S HER! HAHAH I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!' and let out an another uncontrollable laughter. My friend, Navi, said that she was laughing at me. I probably looked really dumb with all the laughing and running away.

I'm fully Korean and I am from Geochang if anyone is curious. I was really lucky today.",74,436

This is it folks. 14 long weeks of tears, fears, mads and bads, all culminating in the final showdown between boys and girls. 14 long weeks of YG's lecherous smile. Who will win? Girls? Boys? BOTH?

BlackPink are probably watching this show thinking about Aliens vs Predator. Whoever wins, we lose.

T-ARA - Absolure First Album/Breaking Heart (Like Pink Tape, this album still sounds brilliant and is still my favorite debut studio album by any Kpop group. Has some amazing bops in it!)

Generally speaking, every 10th edition of Jukebox will have a theme to it. [The very 1st Jukebox](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/) was a theme about the five senses, the [10th Jukebox](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7dvj43/jukebox_10_badwolf_is_staying_up_all_night/) was about The Number Ten and interpreting it in different ways, and this 20th Jukebox is about...well, youll see. But first, the results of last week! Previously we were listening to artists such as Epik High, AOA, Bolbbalgan4, and more! Our highest rated song last week was **Orange Caramel's Catallena** with a score of __9.33__! Congrats Orange Caramel!

Hey, you! Yeah you! Even though your love may be Artificial, or perhaps Platonic, and U may be Pretty indeed, you still attack my heart! Im sure you can guess the theme of this Jukebox from the title, but its a bit more than what youre probably thinking. Can you guess the theme from this weeks songs? Here they are!

1. [Snuper - Platonic Love ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJLYikmDoIM)
2. [Chuu - Heart Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVVfMFS3mgc)
3. [SEVENTEEN - Pretty U ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5juKw-mnGw)
4. [EXO - Artificial Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_x8wjrs4E)
5. [Girls Generation - Dear Mom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIVzQZ0tGvE)
6. [Yoon Mirae - Black Happiness ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DK-MPh7vKk)
7. [MV] [IU - Ending Scene ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5ok0ljrzA)

If its your first time participating in Jukebox and youre not sure whats going on, heres a guide! This is your chance to listen to these songs and leave your thoughts, comments, reactions, and overall feelings about a song. Leave these as a reply to the comment with the song and the title, along with a score between 1 and 10. You can review just one, or all seven songs. If theres an [MV] tag in front of a song, that means you can review both the song and the MV, although youre in no way required to  that part is totally optional! You can leave reviews for songs up until this Friday at 8:00 PM PST. 

I usually dont pick all the songs for Jukebox (only one or two at most), but in the case of this edition, I picked all seven that appear. As for why I picked them; thatll be in a separate section from the usual Other Business section, thatll be titled Explanations.

I'd love to see an all girl kpop band concept. We got a short lived version of this with Wonder Girls in their last couple years, but they never went for a pop rock sound. On the boys end of the spectrum we have Day6, CNBlue, FTIsland, etc. A girl band would have potential to hit it off with the public.",73,56

 * [Translation by @SM_NCT](https://twitter.com/SM_NCT/status/958364142875717634/): Fans that I love. Hello!!! I'm Kun. Everyone, thank you so much for waiting for me! Starting from today, I will greet you all as NCT Kun~ Yes! That's right~ The light has turned green for our life hehe. I don't know how to express this emotion... I've grown up a lot starting with SR15B and now ""Lucky 3 People"", but actually, rather than about effort and reward of my training, something that I actually want to say is that I'm really thankful to our fans who have always been waiting and cheering for us. I will always remember the things that you do for us!! With a grateful heart, we will soon take off with a big ""plane"". I want to share all the fun and happy things that happened to me in my training period with you as soon as possible!! I want to spend all minutes and all seconds with you. It has been NCT Kun until now! Please take care of me well! Thank you!! Ah! Right! There will be a red lunar eclipse on January 31!! Let's wait together for the time when the moonlight spreads all over the world.

 * [Translation by @highonyuta](https://twitter.com/highonyuta/status/958360740712235008): Hello everyone, this is Jungwoo! It's an honor to give this news to the fans who have been there with the three of us all this time. Finally we will debut.  I want to thank the fans that have been waiting for us. We wouldn't be here if not because of the love that you give to us. I will remember this thankful feeling. We will be artists who will put effort to always grow and develop. I sincerely thank you for the support for us, the ""Lucky Three People"" Lucas, Kun-hyung, and myself. Now I can meet you all as NCT Jungwoo! I'm trembling and nervous on the thought of being with the fans. So please help me a lot! Until now, this is NCT Jungwoo!

 * [Translation by @yukheipictures](https://twitter.com/yukheipictures/status/958358282606915585): Hello, I am Lucas! Today I have something important to say! Our ""Lucky 3 people"" will debut soon! I'm so excited and happy. Without you all I wouldn't be the Lucas I am today. You'll be with me from now on, right? Thank you for always supporting me. I'll become a hardworking Lucas! Thank you all.",27,230

2650,2018-01-31,2018,1,31,19,7u8w6c,One last account,jolaurence,1517393065,"I never thought I would have to write that as a title. ""One last account."" Ha. So funny. But it's true. I am leaving this world here on this site for various reasons. I'm going to list them before I post my one last account, which is about working and fangirling in South Korea. Here they are.

1. My ultimate bias way before Johnny was Jonghyun. I got into kpop through SHINee. I have posted so many time about my admiration for him. But his death kind of changed me. Life is short and you have to live more. I actually have been working on a project raising money for Shawols who don't have the funds for the album. I would have shared the link on here but that's against the rules. We reached our goals though. I actually have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since 2015. I've had it my entire life. When a person you cares about dies, you have to grieve. And I need my time to heal before I can through myself into things again that isn't NCT related. 

2. My job keeps me busy. A lot of you know that I am a teacher. I teach the highest class at my job meaning I am under so much pressure to make sure my kids understand what we are talking about. Koreans have very high expectations for their kids and education.My students are 7 year olds and have been doing English kindergarten since they were 5. The expectations are very high for them and I have to make sure I match them.  I'm actually quite good at my job I think and that will be talked about on this post. I finish work and I am exhausted and have more work to do. I don't have those hours of leisure to sit on here anymore. I also think so many people created this image of me on this site as just a fangirl, including the mods, when I in fact am here to work first. Once again, that's talked about in the post. 

3. I'm having a life again. When I lived outside of Seoul, I had literally no friends. My hours made it impossible. So I came to this place to find solace and a home. But this place no longer feels like home. It no longer has that small town Stars Hallows like feel. Instead it feels like a city that no one really talks to anyone unless they have to with Big Brother watching down their back. Since moving to Seoul I have made more friends and started to learn Korean. I can read it but my grammar skills are poor. I did however have lunch with /u/l-autrichienne last weekend. She's doing okay everyone. 

4. I have NCT to take care of now. I have 18 kids and counting. I have promotions soon. I have to focus on work and myself in order to do promotions. The new school year starts in a matter of weeks here. 

So there you have it. Why I am retiring from this sub. I will be posting my fan accounts on the internet, elsewhere. You will be able to find it. You just have to search. Take care everyone,support NCT because this is their year, and maybe you will find me somewhere on the internet. If you do, please don't send me any words of hate. That's not nice and words hurt people. They drive people to suicide by the way, You think your words don't mean anything but sometimes they really do. 

I'm going to be signing out now and leaving you all to read how I maintain a working life and fangirling life in Korea and it isn't easy. It's very hard. 


I get asked the following questions a lot:

*Are you going to xxxxx event?* 

*How are you able to do all this and work?*

*Are you applying for this show?*

*Do you just fangirl all the time?*


To answer these questions, if its on a weekday and during the day no, I save up, is it on the weekend and is NCT there, and no, I dont.

Todays blog post is exactly what the title says it will be. This is how I maintain working and fangirling in South Korea. Other people dont do what I do. This isnt an exact tell all or anything either.

**I am a teacher first. Fangirling is an added bonus.** 

This is something so many people forget. I came to Korea to teach. Fangirling is this beautiful added bonus.*My job comes first*. If I dont do my job well, how will I be able to focus on fangirling? I created a rule with myself when I moved to Korea. My weekdays are focused on work. Weekends are for fangirling.

I had to keep that mantra when I worked at my first place. My hours were Monday through Friday from 2 pm to 9:30 pm and I was usually in by 1:30 pm. I would sometimes go buy albums for weekend fansigns or for getting into music shows in the morning and then have to head straight to work. Right at 9:30 pm on Fridays, I would book it to the train to go into Seoul to get myself on the lists and then run to catch the train back home or the bus and then sleep for like 4 hours before having to get up again. Sounds like fun right? Not really.

At my current job, it makes it much easier for me to get to music shows. I work Monday through Friday from 9:30 am to 6:00 pm and have prep time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. During those times when I am not busy with work, I can catch up on what I have missed during the day. Since NCT hasnt been that active here in a while, I have yet to really do my rushing to the notices yet. But since they will be active soon, I have been spending my weekends doing prep for work so that I can have no extra things to do over the weekends. Im a workaholic, okay?

**I fangirl on a very limited budget.**

On pay day, a good portion of my paycheck goes home to pay the bills. That college debt life and credit card bills, am I right? I then just spend money on what I absolutely need aka food and transportation. Otherwise, I save what I can. When it gets closer to comeback time, I watch everything that I am spending. Every cent counts for me. Do I need chocolate or do I want chocolate? I want it. My mom always told us that we dont need most of the things we want. I learned that especially moving here to Korea. Since I just really stan one group now, I have more money than when I first got here.

**Im strategic about concerts and fansigns.**

When I was at my first job, I wasnt able to try for ticketing for any concerts since tickets always go on sale at 8 pm and I would be in the middle of teaching. Now, I can try for these events. But tickets are expensive and I have to limit myself. I have to look at the location of the concert, especially if it is on a Friday. Even though I now live in Seoul, I live rather far from some things. I have to see if I am able to get there in time or not. This also goes with festivals. I will go to it if NCT and other of my faves are there. If not, then I wont go.

The same goes with fansigns. Before I could only do weekend fansigns. Now I am able to try for weekday fansigns. With NCT, I only try for one or two fansigns a promotion period. I look at the location. I will go outside of Seoul if I have to for a weekend fansign. But if it is a weekday fansign, I have to stay within Seoul and make sure I can get there in time with my work hours as well. I have yet to really do a weekday fansign here in Seoul since I moved here. I have a feeling I will have chances to do some soon.

**Real quick: I do not sell slots for fansigns. Im sorry but also not. I really stick out at fansigns. I do not blend in at all.** 

**I only go for music shows that I know I can get in or have a shot of getting into.** 

With NCT, your tier rank number is everything. Your check in number is also important too, but its the tier. Because of my work schedule, I can only do MuCore and Inkigayo. As I said previously, at my old job I finished at 9:30 pm. I had to rush to catch the train that left at 9:40 to be able to get to the MuCore notice by 10:45 pm at the very latest. I then would have to taxi over to Inkigayo and would be at that notice by 11 pm. Since I figured what time the notices normally came out, on my quick breaks I would check and see how many people were allotted and if it was a prerec, postrec, or a live. If its a live, I dont go to the notice at all. But if it is a prerec or postrec, I go. I only had to do the MuCore rush once since I moved to Seoul but I was able to get there much earlier than normal and that meant I would have a better tier number as well. If both music shows are lives, I dont go for them. I give myself a weekend off to relax and refresh before I have to do something crazy later.

**I enjoy myself.**

I enjoy teaching because I think Im good at it. I enjoy fangirling because its fun getting to see my boys and my friends at promotions Yes, I lose a lot of sleep during promotions time but its part of the second unpaid job. Those early morning bus or taxi rides are fun, yo.

Summary:

* Work first, fangirl second.
* Save, save, save.
* Prioritize concerts and fansigns.
* Go for music shows I have a shot at.
* Have fun.

Remember, this is how I do things. Not everyone just follows one group here. I have friends who follow many groups. But for me, this is how I do things. I hope this helps you all put things in perspective from my point of view. I also hope this answers a few questions that some of you have about my life here as well as some popular misconceptions.",25,107
