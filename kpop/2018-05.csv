0,2018-5-1,2018,5,1,9,8g46x0,Are there any idols/groups that you previously disliked but something changed and now you grew to like them?,sonofasun2,1525133217,"This is really random but I'm curious what can change people's perception liking a group/idol after maybe an initial bad view of them. Ik there was a discussion similar to them but it was years ago and I was curious to people's views as of now. 

For me personally, I disliked SNSD's Taeyeon. The reason is pretty dumb but to me, at that time it was a significant reason as to why I disliked her. She actually used to be my second bias after Jessica (pretty sure you can tell where this is going), but after Jessica left there were these wild rumors where Taeyeon was one of those people who disliked Jessica and wanted her out. I felt so hurt and betrayed that the OT9 bond was fake that I completely unstanned SNSD. Yeah lol, I was pretty petty. Anyways up until a few months ago my feelings for her were still bitter but then I stumble across a youtube video of Jonghyun's funeral while I was on a Jonghyun marathon (lots of crying) and she was there crying. Seeing her cry was one of the worst things I've ever witnessed because at that moment I couldn't understand how I could've hated her. Here was an idol, one of the hardest working, most talented woman of the kpop industry sobbing because one of her best friends passed away. Everyone else crying was also horrible for me to watch (esp Yeri, oh god it brings tears to my eyes everytime I watch her cry) but for Taeyeon, something snapped and I realized I've been wasting my time disliking such a talented person and strong person. It turned my view of her completely and I'm proud to say that I've become a fan again.",199,158

The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and give any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

&amp;nbsp;

**Agenda**

1.      April Town Hall Follow-up
2.	Reddit Redesign
3.     Masked Singer/Spoiler Posts
4.	KCON NY Panel
5.     New Business

&amp;nbsp;

#### April Town Hall Follow-up

Thanks for the feedback last month! It seems like most people are in favor of having a loose definition of K-Pop in regards to what can be posted on the sub. As /u/FoxtrotTango put it, ""if it's somewhat kpop-ish"", its ok.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Reddit Redesign

As you may have heard, Reddit is doing a redesign of their desktop site.  If you want to read more about why they are doing it and what theyre adding, Id recommend reading [this blog post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/). Last month, Reddit gave access to all users to see what the redesign looks like on /r/kpop, you can use the link https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop. One of our concerns about the redesign is that it currently does not allow for rotating Banners, which is, in our opinion, a really great and fun design feature we have on /r/kpop as it constantly features new and different groups. Unfortunately, in the redesign, we really only have the power to change the colors of the subreddit and add reddit made widgets. We plan to do our best to try and get the redesign up to the current functionality of the current desktop version of /r/kpop but it may be a long process to get there.  Do you have any thoughts, questions, or concerns regarding the redesign? If so, let us know below!

&amp;nbsp;

#### Mask Singer / Spoiler Posts

Currently, when participants of show with secret identities are revealed, like in King of Mask Singer, we ask users to flair their post with our spoiler flair. Unfortunately, this does not hide the title on mobile or for users who do not have CSS enabled. As a solution, were proposing to ban all spoilers in titles. In the case of King of Mask Singer, instead of linking the performance, we ask that you make a text post without the name of the artist in the title and with links to the reveal video in the body of the post. This method of posting should apply to other potentially spoiler-y posts on the subreddit as well and we ask that you use your best judgement when posting potentially spoiler-y results. Essentially, we are proposing to have no more spoilers in titles, only in the body of a text post! We welcome any feedback you have about this change!

&amp;nbsp;



#### KCON NY Panel

In some exciting news, /u/Dravvie and I, /u/tuckyd, will be panelists at KCON NY representing the /r/kpop moderator team. We will be discussing online k-pop communities hopefully in conjunction with other moderators from other online sites and forums. We can't reveal all of the details yet (partially because we ourselves don't know all of the details), but if you are planning to KCON NY, we hope to see you at our panel! If you all are interested in us organizing a /r/kpop meet up as well, wed certainly be happy to plan something for all of the KCON NY attendees!

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop. How do you like things lately? Do you like the direction the sub is moving in? Any changes you want to see? The mods are listening. You have the floor.

The article is very length and my vocabulary in English is not as extensive to provide a full translation of the coverage. I'll include as many translated articles as I can that can provide coverage of the situation as there are continuous updates.

Noteworthy points

* Dispatch has revealed Park Jinyoung has been involved with The Saviourists, a group/cult religion created by Yoo Byung Un (Sewol Ferry owner)

* During the events of Sewol, JYP had denied any participation with the group, as his wife is Yoo Byung Un's niece

* The Saviourists is a 'church' that also does business and sells lots of different things, most of the profits are funded both in legal and illegal matters

* Many suspected Yoo Byung Un was using JYP Ent to flow funds to and from for The Saviourists as he's known for evading taxes

* JYP's wife, who's the niece of Yoo Byung Un is also part of The Saviourists, but JYP in 2014 states he was never religious

* A diary also provides evidence that people were aware that there were problems with Sewol a year before the tragedy (2013)

* Yoo Byung Un died in 2014 of June, however JYP is revealed to still have close association with The Saviourists, as he was seen preaching about the Bible being a prophecy on March 20th, 2018, that was part of a 7 day excursion in Yeoksam-dong that was a protest/rally for Evangelists

* There has also been evidence from Dispatch capturing Actor Bae Yongjoon's involvement with The Saviourists as well

[K-Star Live](http://kstarlive.com/Dispatch-Reported-Their-Investigation-on-JYP-and-Actor-Bae-Yongjoon-Following-False-Religion--595788)


Dispatch has made an investigation on Park Jinyoung (JYP) and actor Bae Yongjoon possibly following a false religion.

The media outlet has found that the two veterans in the entertainment industry attended a meeting of 'Salvation' -- which is suspected to be a gathering of a false religion community. Dispatch has now released the recording of the meeting, in which the moderator told his beliefs to the audience. 

Park Jinyoung's past comments about religion have also now resurfaced. In a past interview, Park Jinyoung said that he doesn't believe in any religion. In 2014, he also tweeted, ""I have learned about religion for several years but I will forever have no religion.""

Neither Park Jinyoung nor Bae Yongjoon has released statements about the issue.

162,2018-5-3,2018,5,3,5,8gkrh2,Weirdest/Unlikeliest combinations for possible subunits,AyyThatGirl,1525294139,"This is sort of inspired by a comment in r/LOONA about the maknae line (Choerry, Olivia and Yeojin) being a weird subunit if it ever did happen because of Olivia rating herself as 20% cute but 100% coolness whereas Choerry and Yeojin might be well suited to cuter concepts. So that got me thinking about other weird subunits especially crossover ones.

Some other examples:

(G)I-dle Yuqi, Loona Yeojin and Somi. Yuqi has quite a deep singing voice and I'm not sure it would blend so well with Yeojin and Somi's voices.

Twice Mina, Gfriend Yuju and Dreamcatcher Dami. Not sure why Yuju and Mina struck me as odd, maybe because I associate Yuju with belting out powerful notes and Mina with like a soft soothing voice (which might work better with Eunha) but still having Dami in there with her deep rapping voice doesn't quite match the other two.

Pristin's Nayoung, Red Velvet Irene and Twice Sana. They'd be a strong dance group but they'd probably need someone with strong vocals or maybe even be a rap group, I don't know haha 

Not trying to bring any idols down by doing this, just merely finding out what would be weird combinations!",60,28

There will be not debut out of MIXNINE. Here is another [asianjunkie article about YG's official statement.](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2018/05/03/yge-apologetic-in-statement-about-mixnine-winning-group-not-debuting/)

What do you think of the sentiment that people are 'too easily impressed' when it comes to music, specifically when we're talking about kpop? For instance, when fans of certain songs or groups may express frustration with people who 'sleep on' their talented faves, while liking/supporting other 'mediocre' songs or groups. 

I'm of two minds about this: 

1) I understand some people's frustration. I can maybe see some bandwagon behavior, and can empathize with wanting people to think a little more before they just say something is 'good' and sing it's praises.

2) However, I also feel people use the 'I appreciate real talent and musical quality' thing to feel superior. That, and they take this whole kpop thing too seriously? I mean, is it really /that/ serious if someone appreciates Twice and BTS' music, but doesn't check for (or even hates) BoA and TVXQ's stuff?

	I have been doing a Senior Project based on K-Pop, with more emphasis on the boy bands Shinee and BTS, and I wanted to open the floor about your thoughts about the landscape of K-Pop fan culture and how we can lower tension and rivalries. I have learned through scholarly readings from Sun Jung and scholar Henry Jenkins about Meaningful Participation that fans have just a strong amount of power in the journey of the K-Pop idol as the record labels who manage them, and that the circumstances of BTS mainstream success and the unfortunate loss of Jonghyun can alter the landscape of how their respective fandoms will progress this year. 
	Because of the media attention of both idol groups, ARMY and Shawols have been organizing separate operations that focus on donating and providing relief to nonprofit organizations on behalf of their artists wishes and interests. With the comeback of both Idol Groups, and the bustling of fans preparing their light stick formations and fan chants, I would like to know:

	What is your honest stance of the K-pop fan landscape? Explain why you support them or just casually root for them?
	What elements/components of fan culture do you wish fandoms could improve on?
	Where do you see K-Pop and fan culture in the future?
	What are some recommended K-Pop fan-organized projects/groups that should be given attention?

An advanced thank you to whoever participates in this post and please spread this conversation around with the hashtag #HallyUDoesWell, so that K-pop fans can represent themselves as more than just a collective of music lovers with an expendable wallet.

So I'm a bit of an untraditional k-pop fan: I wasn't really into it at all until my first year of law school. Then I came across Red Velvet's ""Dumb Dumb"" and I was absolutely hooked. I think I needed something with a little less structure in my life to balance out law school haha. Anyways, I'll be working in DC over the summer so I was considering going to KCON NYC. After finding out that Red Velvet was going to be there, I'm definitely going. Are there any tips that any of you more experienced fans can give me to make the most out of my experience? I know this is sort of open-ended, but I appreciate any help whatsoever! ",1,0

I came across this YouTube video on the state of kpop reactions and I find it really interesting. The person really made some good points that resonated with me like 

1) not enough effort from the reaction channels
2) best job in the world
3) reactions as a legal plagarism.

I always thought of kpop reactions as a cheap way to make a living, offering little to the overall K-pop industry. 

Still, another part of me thinks that reactions offer K-pop the much needed exposure to Western countries. 

So who is helping who? I am really confused here haha.

Anyway, here is the link to the said video.

324,2018-5-5,2018,5,5,2,8h0t2y,That moment when you realize you have a new bias group...,itskarlay,1525453353,"This is more of just a fun discussion because it's something I've recently experienced. I've been into kpop for almost 5 years. Personally, I keep up with kpop as a whole to a certain extent, but I've only had 1 group I actively (to use the proper kpop terminology) ""stanned"" - GOT7. Sure, there are some other groups I like more than others and I'll buy a few songs here and there, there are even some groups I regularly keep up with and would say I'm a fan of, but I wouldn't say they were a *bias* group of mine. My bias group obsession is on a different level - I'm sure many of you can relate. 

For instance, BTS has always been my #2 group. I've loved them. I've loved their music. I go to their concerts. I occasionally watch some variety. But I don't buy physicals, merchandise, I won't travel outside of Chicago to see them, I don't keep up with vlives and the other regular content they put out. Whereas for my bias group - GOT7 - I do all of those things. I just assumed I'd never connect with another group like GOT7 - I had figured that surely if BTS couldn't wiggle their way into a true bias position for me than no one else could.

Because of this, I was very surprised when I came to the realization that Stray Kids is a new bias group for me. Obviously, I still love GOT7, but at some point this past week, I realized that I would do just as much for Stray Kids as I do for GOT7. I tried to deny it. But once I went back to watch all of their survival show and literally every other video they've done over the course of one week - I realized that this was more than just casual fan thing.

I know we've had a lot of recurring discussions of what song/mv/video/performance/etc that made you a fan of the group, but I guess I'm just curious to hear from others like me who are a bit more stingy with the term ""bias"" and when you realized that your had a new one. Not what the group did, but what YOU did that made you realize it was next-level love for a group.",62,49

He came home to visit and spend time with the family. Of course I drove myself and my boyfriend to come over as well so we could all eat dinner together. We decided to go out one Sunday to a Korean restaurant. All of a sudden I overhear my brother talking to my mom about how he really likes TWICE. I mean LOVE them. And my mom had no idea who they were as she doesn't listen to K-pop (obviously xD) and asked my brother why he likes them and is it because he sees them as a sexual preference or something. All of my sudden my brother got annoyed and let out a sigh. And he just said to my mom, ""You don't ask that kind of stuff to your own son. There is a fine line between a mother and a son."" 

So my question is .  . . I wonder why my brother likes them. And no I did not ask him personally why. Because I am afraid he would say the same thing to me. And I think he already assumes I know why. Which I don't. So I just wanted to ask everyone what they think? I read online that they are apparently nice girls that work hard to improve their skills and are very cheerful. Is that why maybe my brother likes them? xD 

I wonder which member he likes too. That I would ask him when we meet up again :)

384,2018-5-5,2018,5,5,20,8h708s,"Kdrama watchers, are there any kdramas or idol actors that made you discover a new group you ended up liking?",Turquoise-Turmoil,1525520421,"We know getting idol actors in kdramas and movies is part of the marketing trying to make the group more famous. When has this actually worked for you?

Personally, I have to credit the discovery of kpop at least partly to kdramas and have to admit on a regular basis not recognising idols in dramas and only realising later they're not just actors. 

Here's a few groups I started listening to more actively and started liking more because of kdramas:

* Winner (*Love for a thousand years* - I'm actually quite embarrassed about this one as it seems that the drama was directly made to promote Winner and I only looked up if the main guy -Seung Yoon- was singing so well and I wanted to hear more of it. Turns out he was in this really famous group called Winner :/)
* Bolbbalgan4 (a few dramas - *Some* kept playing in caf scenes and I ended up really liking the song lol)
* Cross Gene (*Legend of the Blue Sea* - I knew Cross Gene already , but because of this drama, I looked up their older stuff and am keeping a closer eye on their comebacks)
* 2PM (*Touching You* - same as Cross Gene, I already know quite a few songs from 2PM, but this drama made me pay more attention to them before their *Gentleman's Game* comeback 
* IU (*The Producers* - this dramas made me more interested in her songs as I really liked what she sang on the show)

I've also failed in getting into groups, which I really wanted to like after seeing members of them in dramas (AOA - *Orange Marmalade* (but I absolutely love their OST for Hwayugi!), Hello Venus - *Suspicious Partner*), but overall kdramas keep making me discover more kpop, which is something I'm really happy about! :)",92,120

The tickets for an upcoming concert in our area went on sale this morning on Ticketmaster. She wore out the F5 button on the laptop waiting for the sale, and then spent 2 hours waiting in their online queue, all to no avail. Sold out.

On scalper websites the tickets are still available, but for 5 times the face value, plus $90 ""convenience fee"" for getting ripped off. I've read articles a while ago basically saying that Ticketmaster is a scam (they""sells"" 99% of inventory to other sites indirectly owned by then in order to avoid restrictions venues place on premiums,) but I never realized how bad this is.

I feel like shelling out $400 for a $90 ticket is encouraging this shady industry. What do people do to buy these tickets at reasonable prices?",5,1

401,2018-5-6,2018,5,6,4,8h9trt,Hi. I'm an internet DJ from Houston and I'm looking for more Korean R&amp;B &amp; Hip-Hop to Chop &amp; Screw. Recommendations please!,BryanDupontGray,1525548882,"As the title says, I'm a DJ from Third Ward, Houston, Texas that does plenty of chopped and screwed remixes. If you aren't familiar what that is, it's basically remixing trend that utilizes two turntables with the same song on both of them. The technique of chopping and screwing a song involves slowing down the pitch and tempo of a song while adding in crossfading, echos and flangers to give off a very ""high"" feel to a song. There's a lot more to it than I can explain because it's very complex, but if you're interested in learning more, I would Google DJ Screw and maybe listen to some of his earlier work. The subreddit /r/ChoppedandScrewed is a good place to go for remixes and I occasionally post my remixes from [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/djhydeheart) there.

Anyways, to the point of this post. I'm looking for more Korean R&amp;B songs to chop and screw. I typically go for songs that have really good down tempo, hip-hop vibes with catchy melodies. Some of my favorite Korean R&amp;B artists right now are Hoody, Nieah, Satebyeol, TVXQ, Big Bang, CL and people like that. I'm open to finding more so that I can build my portfolio. I'm not a big fan of the pop idol sound, so please avoid suggesting those.

I look forward to reading your recommendations. Thanks.",11,0

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation.

#**INTRO**

**NAME:** Teen Top

...yes, it's true, it does stand for ""Teenager Emoboy Emotion Next generation Talent Object Praise""; every single day of my life I wish I could wipe this horrible backronym out of my mind and also out of existence, but ALAS. Listen, at least they don't introduce themselves as ""[Emotional Teen Pop Band Teen Top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkkSIXAOVpM)"" anymore, count your lucky stars.

**MEMBERS:** 5 (previously 6)

**COMPANY:** T.O.P Media

(founded by [Andy](https://absolutshinhwa.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/11-10-31-consolidated-news-andy-returns-from-the-army/) of [Shinhwa](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/822386042598625280))

**DEBUT DATE:** July 10, 2010

**FANCLUB:** Angel

**FAN COLOR:** [Pearl Light Lavender](https://i.imgur.com/yau9Til.jpg)

Yes, they were all actual teens, when they debuted; they were (in international age) - ready? - 17, 16, 16, 15, 15, and *14* (!!!!!), for an average age of 15.5.  
(...just...let that sink in for a minute. Actually, you know what, don't just think about it, here's them [performing 2PM - Heartbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUUytkyuSSg) a couple months before their debut, just *look* at their tiny, tiny faces [so tiny!!!!]).

Basically what you need to know about Teen Top is, they are, 1, *amazing* performers (renowned for their ""knife-like"" choreography), 2, very loud, and 3, happiest when they're being (frequently, violent) little shits to each other. ...it's how you know they're functioning correctly.

If you've seen any Teen Top variety, it's *highly* likely you've seen one of their [Weekly Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc4EdwKpHig) random play [dance segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeqm5PXsdA), which are classics (and because of which they were subsequently banned from drop-kicking each other, on future appearances - seriously, they got an official warning for violence and everything), but they're just as loud and extra *all the time*, from [dance practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uBf85BQucc) to [birthday parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_E-I-xrZxk) to justjust [all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5TbciEknEs). Basically, [constantly noisy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMASANUib2Y), constantly refusing to just let each other *live*; that's Teen Top.

They had some issues to work out, in the beginning (like line divisions; a lot of the earlier songs are like, NIEL, ft. Chunji annnnd Also Some Other Boys I *Guess* [Mostly Because We Need a Rap Break]), but over the years they seem to have got the hang of working together smoothly. When their 7-year contracts were coming to an end, they all re-signed pretty quickly, except of course for L.Joe, who's leaving hit them all pretty hard, because, *as I understand it*, though he had valid complaints with the company, he made the decision to leave without talking to any of the rest of the members about it first, which was [upsetting for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/64ic1k/teen_top_members_open_up_about_ljoes_departure/) and almost took the entire group down. Though I, personally, don't fault him for the fact that he left, I'm so, *so* proud of the rest of them for rallying, after that, and coming back; they really [leaned a lot on each other](https://www.instagram.com/p/BR3SpauB7AB/) for support and, though they rarely outwardly show it, their time together has given them a strong bond andwell, I love it.  
Anyway, they've made it back now to [hitting each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCd2Kd4fAqA) and finding it *hilarious*, so that, also, is comforting.

*****

All TOP Media groups are amazing dancers, but nobody in K-pop busts out the footwork quite like Teen Top. They always post dance versions of their MVs, as well as dance practice videos, and they're *definitely* worth checking out - if you haven't seen Teen Top dance, you are *Missing. Out.* Rocking is the archetypal example of What Teen Top Can Do (and yes, they got multiply injured doing it, but they can bust it out now like it's second nature), but they haven't left the complicated choreography behind, over the years, and frankly, they kill it. 

#**MEMBER PROFILES*

**[CAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEm3qHV-_mI)**:

* **Name:** Bang Minsoo  
* **Born:** November 4, 1992  
* **Position:** leader, main rapper  
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bangminsu1992/)

Is not much of a talker and tends to be pretty low energy most of the time, but the rest of the members know him well enough by this point that they aren't phased; Niel and Ricky especially find great enjoyment in hassling him like bratty younger brothers. Also despite appearances he really does try to fill his position as leader and look out for the rest of them, and over the years (especially since they've lost a member, now) he's become more outwardly forthcoming with his affection for them. I still wouldn't classify him as *chatty*, he continues to [mystify](https://youtu.be/IKAjLXJufk8?t=31s) and [terrify](https://youtu.be/u0ZtOsbpJxI?t=3m10s) (poor tiny baby Xiao, lmao) his hoobaes, but he's [also just](https://youtu.be/81bLal-n8Y4?t=2m36s) Bang Minsoo who does [terrible aegyo](https://youtu.be/cGtg5tIGnrY?t=1m24s) and spends their breaks sleeping and playing video games [at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJPn9wjv3vo) with [his dogs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHPU0gOhu7n/) (or at Niel's house, more often than not).

* Before becoming an idol was studying art; has designed [several](https://imgur.com/nx70WBV) of his [tattoos](https://imgur.com/Ff8VQBQ) (his sleeves are some of my favorite tattoos in all of K-pop)  
* Acted, along with Yura from Girl's Day, in the MV for [Wheesung - Night And Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdep8srF-w8)  
* Solo track (released on Soundcloud): [ (I Decided to Go, Right?)](https://soundcloud.com/ollepolleteam/llcv9ffpvdna)

**[Chunji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_YwsVfHpFU)**:

* **Name:** Lee Chanhee  
* **Born:** October 5, 1993  
* **Position:** lead vocal  
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teentop_2ch/)

...Did he tell you he loves ballads? He *loves* ballads (were it up to Chunji, probably, every Teen Top song would be a ballad). He's maybe the most subdued? of all of them, but don't be fooled, he also will not *hesitate* to throw his members under the bus if the occasion calls for it (which, in this group, it often does). He's not shy, either (you kind of - can't be, in Teen Top); [goes the hardest](https://youtu.be/O9ALUB50M90?t=1m31s) in the Pepero game, and would just *love* to tell you all about how handsome he is (and sells you on it, too, despite being [Hamster-ssi](https://youtu.be/8O7hUKHwxQU?t=2m38s) [though, largely, if he gets compared to any animal it's [a squirrel](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Da_xAZ7WAAA3ZWY.jpg)) Also, [apparently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgm35_eR94) hates walking, and looking at people (\#[relatable](https://youtu.be/Ov2JOBT_bH0?t=4m36s)).

* Duet with Eunha from GFriend, [Hold Your Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtUTHleLE6E) (performed live on tour [with Ricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbAnqHqm-aA))  
* Appearance on [King of Masked Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf0ubf8Ua78) ([unmasking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHEAzC4p1aU))

**[Niel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkM0UmJtKr4)**:

* **Name:** Ahn Daniel (so his name is actually pronounced, two syllables, Ni-el)  
* **Born:** August 16, 1994  
* **Position:** main vocal

Probably the most easily recognizable member, for those lips, but even his hair is essentially always the same, just varying colors (...minus last year when he [cut it all off](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/916621934820941825) like he's been threatening to for ages, but, *usually*!). *Constantly* running his mouth, tbh usually to drag someone and then immediately cover it by acting all innocent; otherwise pretty much just always being extra; he stops himself from being bored by [annoying his hyungs](https://youtu.be/ilz-30V-f9g?t=34s) (L. Joe used to get most of it, but now it's [generally CAP](https://youtu.be/ilz-30V-f9g?t=2m47s)). During his solo promotions he's...still himself, in interviews and the like, but much more subdued and awkward; he's more in his element surrounded by his [members, labelmates and friends](http://www.vlive.tv/video/42513), giving them a hard time [like usual](https://youtu.be/Rcr9wvK68_E?t=9m50s) (...that impression is *spot. on.*). Also, the [biggest](http://yooneroos.tumblr.com/post/135326849096/when-you-up-to-no-fucking-good) meme [of them](https://youtu.be/Cjy_wXql9cw?t=5m40s) all, [tbh](https://twitter.com/EmotioNielAngel/status/990524636419969025).

* Had two (with repackages) solo albums to date, the singles of which are:  
&gt;[Lovekiller (ft. Dok2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwseCqPrN4I)  
&gt;[Spring Love (ft. Juniel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJUhXyt8iw)  
&gt;[Love Affair (ft. Giant Pink)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-fo6294xmA)  
&gt;[What's Good? ft JUSTHIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uttgCq3um8E)  
&gt;(Notable B-side: [Affogato (ft. CAP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNN25Ry53t8) ; also the entirety of the [Love Affair... album](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA-a-HxjUXBA0HYDoOtdHmDVkRhIH0whR) because there are too many great songs on it for me to pick just one fav).  
* Appearance on [King of Masked Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK9TFkJepK0) ([unmasking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGc_vhs3vto))

**[Ricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cArhSExxqRs)**:

* **Name:** Yoo Changhyun  
* **Born:** February 27, 1995  
* **Position:** vocal  
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ricky_teentop_/)

Not the technical maknae, but probably forever the acting one. He's small and soft and seems to have the same [baby face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peTnsK782SE) no matter how old he gets, and when the rest of the members tease him he very much reacts to it, which of course means they continue to do it All The Time. You can't help but be fond of him; he's a cutie ([tbh, okay](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiPHQNlHLww/)). Historically, one of the members with the least amount of lines per song, though it's gotten better with time. His [best friends](http://68.media.tumblr.com/263d0e7677df10eefa644fa562256013/tumblr_nkgfnbxtv31qfsww7o1_1280.jpg) are other '95-line idols, like BTOB's Sungjae, VIXX's Hyuk, and the Boyfriend maknae line; they've all known each other for ages now and still [hang out](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHd6cflgDBT/) and support each other's activities constantly.

* Was a child actor, did some CFs and also appeared, back in 2009, in the MV for [Seo Taiji - Human Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPUByed-qrQ).  
* As aforementioned, JBJ's Takada Kenta is a huge Teen Top fan, but especially so of Ricky; here's him right after Broduce, [getting surprised by a phonecall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N81-FTdhiTU) with Ricky (also the peanut gallery here, lmao, I love)

The other reason they all bully Ricky so much is because he's much less intimidating than their *actual* maknae, who is [tall and manly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUx4LPkXD7U) and pretty much immune to embarrassment, *and* is good at almost everything (and if he isn't, yet, at something, he learns fast [e.g, he's now TOP Media's [chief nailartist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2Lo_1O7PI)]). Changjo's their [main dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTaoKDvmGo), a vocal, has taken up a fair amount of rapping these days, consistently writes/composes songs for their albums (including, one of my personal [ultimate favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=detjOYq6QLo) songs of last year) and now for other groups, and is their ace at basically every single game they play (especially if it's something physical). He's always been pretty introverted (and has previously spoken about his struggles with [bipolar disorder](https://www.soompi.com/2016/11/16/teen-tops-changjo-describes-what-his-health-was-like-during-slump/)), but he's got a strong passion for music and dance, and is constantly creating, whether with Teen Top, or on his own. These days you can really tell he's grown up a lot, physically and also emotionally; he's really matured and is coming into his own (not to make this emotional, randomly, but honestly I'm proud of him, and how he's grown up).

#**VARIETY/TO WATCH**

Because they've, as a group, grown up in the Era of Variety~ (and have finely tuned their skills because of it; tbh they're variety GOLD), there is SO. MUCH. out there to watch. This is not going to be an exhaustive list! But, here are some things:

Like I said, this is not everything (not *nearly*), there's lots more out there, but hopefully this makes a good jumping-off point, at least.

#**COMING SOON**

They are coming back this Tuesday, May 8th, with a [new mini](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/992690384718344192) album, [Seoul Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNq7MH30Feo)!! They've already performed one of the b-sides on that album,  (Let's Play!), live at their fanmeeting earlier this year, and then while they were on tour in Europe. Almost all the fancams of it seem to be single-member focus, frustratingly, but [here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0xtw5ke4lo), at least.

If you're an Angel, if you've ever been a fan in the past, or even if you've never gotten into them until this point, please check them out, this comeback!! They're old[er] (in experience, still pretty young in age!) but they're still here, still going, and still quality, even, now, almost 8 years in.

Because the members were all so young when they debuted, they initially focused more on having a ""noona-killer"" sort of image - thus No More Perfume on You, Eric's guest appearance (and shower scene) in the Supa Luv MV, etc. They gradually outgrew that schtick though, and as they themselves have matured over the years - both physically and emotionally - so has their music (as well as the level of involvement they have in it). At the same time though, they haven't lost the things that make them *them* - they're still ridiculous, lmao (why...are [they like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PezjTKXz2r8)) ...but also, still, frankly, knocking it out of the park with amazing jams and solid albums, and of course, killer choreography always.

...I feel like I'm like, that weird aunt who only comes to visit every so often and is like, ""ooohhh, you used to be *so* small, and now look at you, all grown up, and so handsome[/pretty/what-have-you]!!!"", but.........honestly, though. They used to be [*so* small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d-i-R3F7b8) (I can't; going back to the earliest videos on their YT channel is a *trip*), and now look at them, all grown up and handsome!!! 

Actually, lmao, gearing up for this comeback TOP Media's been doing some retrospectives of their own ([Music Eras](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/988223519484919808) ; [Fashion](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/988924609083813888) ; [Teen Top x Angels](https://twitter.com/TEEN_TOP/status/989436467096121344) during High Five promotions), in which they refer to last year as the start of ""Act 2"", which is a way of phrasing it I absolutely *love*.  
Teen Top have done so much great stuff these past 7+ years, and I'm so, *so* excited to see what's next.

...Alternately, if you will allow me to rephrase that in the form of some \#poetry [from 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhmP1pu5yv8):

*ONE TWO THREE FOUR! Everybody come on, here we go! Teen Top, GO, GO! Put your hands up high!~*",39,122

It would be great is the support of international fans is enough to make those artists/groups successful, but it seems like the only way a group can truly be successful is if they are popular in S. Korea, because the biggest money making income streams are always the CFs. Concerts income is only substantial for really popular artists/groups, and same with merchandise, streaming, digital/physical sales, etc. Good income from TV show appearances are rare for unpopular artists/groups, and there are almost no opportunities outside of S. Korea for those who aren't popular. 

So I was wondering if there any available data for local vs international sales/income for K-Pop artists/groups, so we can clearly see just how much of a difference international fans can make? ",34,9

845,2018-5-11,2018,5,11,13,8iky1h,Learning about fanchants.,ItsWolflord,1526011313,"So, first off I'm writing this using the new Reddit layout which makes this interesting. 

Okay let's just jump into this. So, I was watching kpop videos, like comebacks etc. and started thinking about how I never really got into or researched the fan chants. Like I know they exist and I love hearing them, but I just don't know much about them. So, of course the first thing I did was google ""kpop fanchants."" It led me to an article about a post on here about the best fanchants. Then in a comment I saw someone else who was looking into fanchants comment about how they didn't know fanchants guide videos were a thing and neither did I. Next step was to watch some of those videos and see what they entailed. So happy those videos exist so I can know learn fanchants a lot easier and some groups even make their own fanchants version/guide videos which are very entertaining to watch. I was still missing a big part of this whole thing and that is how/who makes the fanchants. So, I again went to google and typed ""how are fanchants made."" I found a site that had a whole like history lesson on fanchants. When the first ones were created and how they are usually created now. Which the answer in short is either the company releases a video prior or it's made by a fansite and people go and memorize it as fast as they can. This was a very fun journey and I will most definitely look into fanchants more. If I missed out any important information or anything please let me know. I have been a fan of Kpop for a long time now, but I just never got into this part of the fandom. Sorry for a long post, but I thought someone else who might be interested in fanchants or hasn't really thought about it yet would get something out of this post.",4,23

Do you think Lucas is a good rapper? I know we have seen very little of his skills, but I wanted to know your opinions. He's my NCT bias and I absolutely love his personality!

Anyway, what I want to talk about doesn't have anything to do with it and I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but..

Do you think he's decent unlike many SM ""rappers""? Can he be called a rapper just as Taeyong and Mark?

I'm hoping to read you soon!",4,0

I'm in need of information and experiences of the Korean Wave in China. This is for a university assignment regarding pop culture in Asia and ofc Kpop is a HUGE part of this. As China is the biggest consumer of the Hallyu wave industry, how do you think it has affected China's own popular culture? This can be in regards to Kpop itself, Korean dramas/variety shows \(eg. Running man, Masked Singer\), cosmetics, etc. 

Any comments or opinions on the Anti\-Korean Wave thing in China?

Does the China lines of Kpop idol groups impact on Chinese audience?

Further info and comments on the Kpop ban that happened.

And what would the future of Chinese pop culture seem as there are shows like the Idol Producer with Yixing and Jackson? Do you think Chinese idol groups will soon be successful and what would be the difference compared to Kpop?

Thank you!! All responses are appreciated :D ",2,1

BY MY LIFE

Hello, and welcome to this weeks Jukebox thread! This week will have songs that were submitted in pairs as boy/girl songs, plus a song featuring a co-ed duet! But first, last weeks results. Last week we featured SHINee as an Artist Spotlight but also included artists and recent releases such as HA:TFELTs Pluhmm, EXIDs Lady, and GroovyRooms My Paradise! The highest ranked song of last week was **SHINees View with a score of 9.16**, congrats SHINee V! 

[Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox) | [Full Updated Rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_full_rankings) | [Last Weeks Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8h92pz/jukebox_34_this_view_is_5_for_5_cuz_tonight_is/)

For it was Adam who was first created, and then Yves. And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. 

And then Yves peaced the fuck outta there and was like BRB gonna go make my own Eden now BYE and made her own chromosome

Like mentioned last week, this weeks songs were pairs of songs submitted as a girl song and a boy song! It would be a combination of one boy and girl group/subunit/soloist song and the idea was to submit songs you thought went well together. Heres what ended up being on Jukebox this week!

1. [Wendy x Eric Nam - Spring Love ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erErBFKPbMY)
2. [Samuel - One (feat. Jung Ilhoon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvAk65H4JCI) 
3. [Chung Ha - Roller Coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFWiME1uVrY)
4. [Baek A Yeon - so-so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQG-S4mU0U)
5. [DAY6 - Letting Go (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1TGNmQqZA)
6. [The Boyz - Giddy Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM74CO0mOFo)
7. [LOO/Yves - new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIDe-yTxda0)

You know what to do! But if youre not and youre *new* and dont have a clue, heres a review on what to do! Each week, you will get the chance to listen to seven different songs, something potentially old and something new. After listening to the songs, you get to leave your thoughts on them, either One or all seven of them! Leave your thoughts as a review/reply to the comment with the artist and song title. Along with your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10. Your review can say whatever you want - just please be respectful. Dissenting and critical opinions are allowed, but dont be inflammatory or disrespectful to the artist please. If a song has an [MV] flair on it, that means you can review both the MV and the song together, although that is totally optional. As a reminder, you have until this Friday at 8 PM PST to leave a review (this isn't a hard deadline, but please try to get them in before then!).

I'm asking this because i just spent the past week marathoning Tao's dramas and variety show appearances and have genuinely come to like him for his honesty and commitment to important causes. Not to mention the way he treats female contestants on the two shows he judges is very respectful and sweet. 

All this comes as a surprise to me because he never really stood out much in EXO to me. I suppose he's experiencing a huge peak in his career in China and that just led me to become more aware of him but he's definitely one of my top biases now. 

Any similar stories?",31,46

Music, style and even the way people talk and decide on what is generally popular. Non black people wanting to talk walk and dress/look and act black. I was thinking now that Kpop is slowly starting to become more and more mainstream with time, are we going to see more people want to emulate this style and be more ""Korean""/Kpop? More people wanting to go to Korea and learn to speak and act Korean? or more of Korean/Kpop culture/speech/dress/behavior be integrated into mainstream society? Just looking for thoughts and opinions. I personally think that we are seeing the beginning stages of this, but probably wont be as huge but I may very well be wrong. ",3,0

All that sugar, salt, and preservatives in the junk food are so bad for them. Even if it's not about weight control, all that crap still messes with their skin and will cause other healthy issues. I wonder if part of it is due to emotional eating, trying to cope with the stress of being an idol? Young kids look up to the idols so they're not exactly setting a good example. But maybe that's also what makes them more relatable? The managers should provide them healthier snacks instead (but that might be more expensive, since junk food is cheap).

examples:

[SHINee \- Prism](https://open.spotify.com/track/3vm0mFRTYFRmtym8SPHmUq?si=UvnpM_MDTn243vapYv-eGQ) \- This has a very UK garage\-y feel to it which I really appreciate

[EXO\-CBX \- The One](https://open.spotify.com/track/53LEFZFqPLoN0tWwaTk17C?si=2qX5DQ8tSSaEiB3dmNj4FQ) \- Not even sure what genre this would be classified as but the production is sexy as hell and really out of the ordinary, especially for the sub\-unit of one of the biggest kpop groups of all time.

[TWICE \- WOW](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ShgNuFJouJbl2KMMQyJ0Z?si=v18SHscgQS6voLYsMB1Ubw) \- Most definitely my favorite Twice song. I could go on all day about how fantastic the production for this song is in my opinion, but to put it simply, I love the scattered variety of samples used, and the style change in the pre\-chorus is pretty awesome, too.

[Red Velvet \- Attaboy](https://open.spotify.com/track/42VsUQkljZvZh8KdQYrBH7?si=ST2X_vvNS6KUjJjjkxZe9Q) \- This song is all over the place, but at the same time it keeps the same trap\-influenced theme throughout, and the way it's implemented is weird but very effective to me.

[TWICE \- ROLLIN'](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JOsuiuc52sgzT6dRyU7h4?si=cF2iGSadSy6kcqEpP4lSEA) \- I'll be honest, I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me majorly. The late 2000s EDM\-esque production wasn't really getting to me, but now I think the song is really good and I absolutely love everything about it.

[NCT U \- The 7th Sense](https://open.spotify.com/track/5TkRTndV0IgRRO3HVr94P1?si=-ULKqQk2ToKtA4bIsduYRg) \- How could I have a thread about experimental production without this gem? I'm honestly surprised this song got as popular as it did considering how experimental the production and instrumental are.

[millic and Fanxy Child \- Paradise](https://open.spotify.com/track/4NFM2QFORBtYLD5514jRip?si=TSMW7xqNRwKRaMD94QSDUg) \- I'm honestly shocked this instrumental isn't on SoundCloud. This sounds like something I would hear on there when I'm browsing through my feed.

That's all I can think of \(which I now realize is a whole lot\), but I'd love to hear more! Any suggestions? Thanks!",116,177

Take **Wanna One**'s Park Jihoon, who has recently stated that he no longer wants to be known as the 'cute Jeojang kid' anymore and wants to be taken seriously but even on this Reddit people will stating that, ""he is too cute to take seriously"" or ""he IS Jeojang"". And I know other idols have had issues with being regarded as a baby/child/child-like for much longer than they needed to be, like **BTS**'s Jimin and Jungkook, **SHINee**'s Taemin and IU (who even had to write a song about actually being an adult).

So I ask you guys... is this something that you are guilty of? And is this something that could be damaging if prolonged?",15,0

One thing I like to do with my giveaways is to pose some questions as a requirement for entry as a sort of way to get people talking and give the community an outlet to gush about their favorite groups.

1382,2018-5-17,2018,5,17,0,8jvylp,How I got into kpop...,JMuay,1526485655,"Yes... unfortunately Im one of those noobs that got into kpop from seeing BTS perform at the AMAs... but that isnt what got me hooked. 

Before I get into it. For many people who have never heard of kpop or ever watched/listened to any of it before that you have this stereotypical mindset toward it that its all girly and poppy and for little girls. Not that I had that mindset personally but you know what I mean that its the general stereotype toward kpop. 

So after listening to them it caught my eye and I checked out some of BTS other songs shortly after that. Dope, Mic Drop, etc etc etc. I really enjoyed the music so I decided to expand and delve deeper into kpop...

This is when I got hooked in. EXO hooked me in. The music was so relatable to what I already listened to. I loved everything about their music. 

After that I was basically in at that point. The next groups I checked out after that were Big Bang, Twice and Blackpink. Initially I still had that mindset that I wouldnt like the girl groups but boy was I wrong.... every song I listened to from Twice and Blackpink I was impressed with. Its insane that all this time this industry existed and I didnt know about it. Big Bang.... every song.... incredible. I could go on and on about twice and Blackpink but this is long enough already lol.

After keeping it with those groups for a little while I finally decided to venture out... this is when I discovered Seventeen, Got7, NCT, Stray Kids, etc etc etc Ill keep my favourite group out till later lol. I could keep going about all the groups I listed above but like I said earlier this is already pretty long.

Its insane to me that all these groups have amazing rappers, amazing choreography and amazing vocals. Im blown away by this industry so far and Ive barely stepped through the door. 

I know I missed talking about a lot of groups and dont get me wrong I could go on and on about how I enjoy every one of them.... 

Ever since I watched the performance at the AMAs and every MV, interview, etc etc from every other group up to this point I gotta say that my favourite group has to be Winner. I love the music, I love the members and Im addicted to Really Really and Everyday. 

Im so glad that I got into this industry and got to learn everything about it so far and I plan to keep going further and further. Im open to recommendations of other groups or songs I should check out because like I said earlier... I barely stepped through the door into the industry and everything it has to offer.

Thanks for reading and Im very interested to hear about how you guys got into kpop and who youre favourite groups and songs are.

Another is the famous line from Shindong in Mamacita.

The Korean groups are looking younger and younger even though they're staying approximately the same age - 18-22. But why do they look so young? They look like they're 16 while before they used to look like they were 25 or so. 

You'd never, ever see someone like [Fei](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_IG9UeXtwYIw/TSdNfVYC8RI/AAAAAAAAAL4/NFwE7bIeUg0/s1600/Fei1.jpg) debut these days. She was 23 when she debuted and their concept wasn't that much more mature but all of them, including Suzy, just seem mid-twenties. 9muses, Dal Shabet, etc all looked like fierce unnis in their mid-twenties as well at the time of debut. But they're the same age as kids debuting nowadays like Nayoung, Dahyun who look like they're 16. The cognitive dissonance is pretty baffling to me; idols used to look like people to look up to, fierce unnis/oppas who seemed more mature in the face were preferred. Now they all look super duper young. But they're the same age. 

Boy groups as well; 2pm at 21/22 is VERY different from WannaOne at 21/22. They just look... young. Beyond the concepts and all of that. ",1,2

I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like every time a new group comes out nowadays, the first reaction everyone has is, ""Hype, *but* I don't really like their name tho."" Personally, I think a lot of the new name meanings are kinda dumb (Neo Culture Technology, Pristine + Elastin?? = Pristin), but for the most part I find the names fun and catchy enough to pass. Is it just an issue where every name is dumb, but people get used to it / ignore it as a group get popular? Are we all blinded by nostalgia? Did we somehow run out of passable names? What gives?


I'd love to hear what group names you think get a bad rap, or the names that only you seem to be bothered by.",126,85

1507,2018-5-18,2018,5,18,5,8k7lzz,Is the future of kpop girl groups majority cute/innocent groups?,ruokco,1526590015,"Groups like Gfriend, Twice, Lovelyz, April, Oh My Girl, Loona, and now with Moonlight Angels (supposedly) and Produce48 group.  After watching the intro's for P48, literally 90% of them are similar cute/aegyo types, some of them even as far as singing children's songs. 

Remember Apink is the only one to survive with no more than five or so 2nd gen groups remaining...no, no, no this cant be the case can it? I dont know...Honestly Im a fan of them but not pleased everybody is out to do the same thing and trying to turn kpop into jpop. And Apink could do more mature concepts if they wanted to, its just that their company played it safe. 

There's Blackpink and Diet BP (Gidle), CLC, Pristin's subunit and Dreamcatcher, but majority of popular groups really seem like they are going to keep doing safe cute or 'mixed cute' concepts (like IOI Crush). Even if Twice does a girl crush, itll probably be something mixed with cute. No more groups like Fx, Sistar, Miss A, Kara, BEG, old AOA, and After School to do something more mature and artistically appealing.

For example, one of my bias groups is EXO and one narrative I find lots of people talking about is that because they dont produce a large chunk of their music, they are untalented. And this is said despite members like Lay and Chanyeol having multiple album credits.

On the same vein, as a fan, what are some narratives about your bias group(s) that you would like others not to believe or at least acknowledge as misleading?",152,154

~Whatever comes, comes through clear  
Do you slide on all your nights like this?  
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)  
Put some spotlight on the side  
And whatever comes, comes through clear~




Hello, and welcome to this weeks Jukebox! The seven songs featured this week are submitted by none other than YOU! These were the songs chosen from the submissions for this week! Surprisingly, most of the songs submitted have a pretty good summer vibe to them, which I really liked since summer is just around the corner and the weathers getting warmer! (and if you do not live in the Northern Hemisphere, then I apologize)

**Submission Question: If whales were singing your song, then where are the whales singing?**

_Your answers:_

1. [Girls Day - Darling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9NuaxhgcM):  
**1732S 14919W**  somewhere tropical, but with no land in sight. Whether the water is warm or cold doesn't matter, the song would fill up the seeming void that is the ocean with warmth and happiness in an instant

2. [Pentagon - Shine ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2yQ1zYDYU):  
**4852.6S 12323.6W**  Near Point Nemo the loneliness point on earth 

3. [B1A4 - A lie ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x67c_lYqTQ8):  
**8403N 17451W**  the middle of the ocean, where the waves crash down and the water roils

4. [NCT Dream - My First and Last ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pUc7SD0PmU):   
**2059'45.5""N 15640'04.4""W**   at a bright and colorful coral reef when there are lots of other animals around, and they just want to spread good vibes

5. [Red Velvet - Cool World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KL1BNIOVLc):  
**3648'34.5""N 12147'49.1""W**  close to the surface, jumping out and such. An uplifting sight

6. [Lim HyunSik - Swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H5u-jMDWG0):  
****  This isn't a new song for whales, they've grown up hearing it all their lives, so it's a part of them and they sing it all the time.

7. [Jonghyun - Take the Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeaGMsL83So):  
** 200m below sea level**   at a sea level where it's just deep enough where if you were to look up, you could still see and feel the sun's rays shining through the surface of the water

Not sure what to do? First time on Jukebox? Hope its not your last! Go with the flow  and just read here on what to do: each week, youll get the chance to review seven songs, both old and new (face all my life). The majority of the time they are randomly picked: this week, the songs were user-submitted, meaning users of r/kpop submitted songs and I chose them based on their submission responses. Now that theyre picked, you get to listen to them! Feel free to listen to one or all seven of the songs, afterwards you can write a review for it leaving your thoughts and opinions on your listening experience. Along with your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10. Normally, one song will have an [MV] tag in front of it in which you can review both the MV and the song; however, this week, any of the songs with MVs accompanying them can be reviewed as well! Feel free to leave as many reviews as you like. As a reminder, please have your reviews/scores done and submitted by 3:00 AM UTC (convert to your timezone [here](https://savvytime.com/converter)), which is not a hard deadline but I would prefer if you get your reviews in before that time.

They hooked me with DOPE and HYYH/Young Forever will be their best era IMO. WINGS was pretty good and I did appreciate that everyone got a solo song. I enjoyed YNWA but they lost me at the Love Yourself series. It took a while for DNA to grow on me and I dont like much else on that album. Now I greatly dislike Fake Love because of the overuse of autotune and its so far from their style it doesnt feel genuine. Also seeing them being treated as a sideshow makes it hard to watch anymore. ,9,0

But slowly I began to realize how not great it is. And not in a pop sense, but in a music sense. Visuals are the 85% of entire group, which devalues the music imo (which usually have sub par lyrics) and oh the pandering to English speaking audiences with a random non Korean lyric that only takes away from the song. 
And while up to this point you might be boiling and hating everything I say, but the whole industry is so toxic for the idols! And that is something that can't be denied. I cannot support an industry that just beats people into molds and are kept in boxes. Some fans can be rabid as well. Then there is the creativity aspect of it, which is really just calculated by executives to see what trends are the most popular. It has just stared to get on my nerves. 
Maybe I just got a little old for it (I was at my peak when I was 15 or so). Maybe this isn't the right way to vent either but whatever I guess.",5,0

It kills me cause kpop is such a vain industry/music and i loved it so much. But being ugly it feels like i dont fit into it and i cant enjoy tracks anymore cause i dont feel young and attractive anymore. I feel like an old ugly man listening to young people's music. Additionally the fact that i know that all idols/koreans or prolly even kpop fans would find me disgusting.

YouTube video views reflect how many times a video has been watched and can be an important measure of a video's overall popularity.

We want to make sure that videos are being viewed by actual humans and not computer programs. During the first couple of hours after a video has been published, we'll only show views that our systems believe to be valid. This might not yet show all legitimate views at that time.

After quality views are counted, view count updates more frequently. The process of including all quality views can take some time depending on a video's popularity and viewership. Afterward, the view count updates more frequently, but keep in mind that we're constantly validating views, so view count can always be adjusted.

Frozen view count
On some videos, the view count might seem frozen or not show all the views that you expect. Video views are algorithmically validated to maintain fair and positive experiences for content creators, advertisers, and users. To verify that views are real and accurate, YouTube may temporarily slow down, freeze, or adjust the view count, as well as discard low-quality playbacks.",1,2

It was a whole 23 minutes, and at one point he asked for questions. Barely anyone said anything! I wish it wasn't so common for people to just tell idols to 'say hi to (blank)' or 'say (blank) in english!'. Those comments are fine in moderation, but holy shit, can't people ask sth interesting too? Do people /just/ go to these lives to see idols sit in silence the whole time or say hi to random countries? 

Sorry if this sounds hella trivial, this shit just makes me so mad lol. ",2,0

Or is it something else?,ShapeShifter499,1527038957,I'm noticing a rise of Korean groups in America.  BTS is one that is appearing on a load of TV programs I watch. Now what is going on here?  Are people taking the time to learn Korean just to understand the songs?  Is it just solely because the artists have some sort of appeal or looks?  Or is there a bigger community of Korean relatives in America than I realize?    I just feel silly listening to songs in other languages that I don't understand. I'm just curious to know what is fulling the popularity. ,8,0

From Wikipedia:

&gt; The Collaboration is essentially a variety show focused on creating a collaboration between Korean and Chinese artists on music, composition and performance. A survival/competition show where 4 teams will be formed and songs composed will be voted on.

&gt; Between episode 2 and 9, there will be voting from netizens to pair the participants for collaboration. The song that receives the most votes in recording room in each episode will go to the final round. The song that receives the most votes from both recording room and online in the final round will win.

&gt; There will be 4 teams. Each team will have 1 participant from Korea and 1 from China.",8,124

2064,2018-5-23,2018,5,23,23,8ljuxi,"Censoring BTS' ""Fake Love"" and anti Asian racism - a Non American, Asian perspective",Bwacha,1527086238,"For anyone who isn't aware, for North American radio play and live performances the words  \(niga ""nee\-ga"" \- you, you're\) and  \(nae\-ga; I, me\) are being censored \(some sources say the actual lyrics might be changed\). This is because they can sound similar to the n slur. \(I don't say they *do* sound similar, because they don't. There are very clear pronunciation differences in the words in both speech and song the overwhelming majority of the time.\)

The argument for this is that business is business and nobody is making BigHit agree to do this, it's just something they have to do to keep pushing for BTS' success in North America. A potential scandal would of course be terrible so they're doing what they can to avoid it. Complaints about the lyrics, even if incorrect, could get ""Fake Love"" or ""DNA"" pulled from radio play or reduce the number of invites BTS get to perform. I understand these arguments and on a purely business level they are valid.

But I very strongly disagree with this happening.

It is mindblowing that in order to avoid causing offensive and being construed as racist, people are okay with censoring innocent words in another language. That to my mind is offensive and actually racist itself. Yes, when you go to another country you should conform to their rules and culture within reason \- censoring innocent language because it could be misheard by others does not fall within those parameters. It is exceedingly ethnocentric and disgustingly lazy to censor innocent and key parts of another language because instead of encouraging multiculturalism, instead of even putting out a simple release about the language; people would rather take the easy route of letting racism go unchallenged, of actually bowing to it preemptively. Seriously, just sit back for a minute and think about what it really looks and sounds like to have a foreign Asian group censoring their native language because North America doesn't want to deal with it. You cannot tell me that is progress. That is actively hampering progress. That is a gigantic con to any success BTS are experiencing.

And here's the thing: When does it end? Does it ever end?

How long are people content for every day terms in Korean to be censored and reacted to as if inappropriate? Because by censoring I think you're only prolonging that time. By censoring, you're behaving as if these words are actually inappropriate, you're reinforcing the idea that they are using slurs, and you are not normalising the language. People cannot get used to something they cannot see or hear! We cannot defeat these misconceptions if we are 'not allowed' to encounter them and to talk about them and educate on them.

Racists exist. The rest of us are not obliged to entertain them like this. And if you'd like to fight racism and reduce the number of racists, having a racist ruling on a foreign group instead of confronting the actual racists is a little counterproductive.

How do we break down barriers if we're just setting up others at the same time?

If we're having to censor innocent words in our language when performing a pop song of all things, then how we are better than being dancing monkeys? Just another ""lol those weird Asians"" trend? It's so disheartening. The bar for Asians to get into the Western industry is so high \- why do you think so many gyopo are in kpop? \- and even when a group like BTS gets some traction they're still not getting respect.

As overdramatic and oversensitive as some people might think I'm being these 'compromises' to try and break into the West invariably only go one way just feel like betrayal and Whitewashing. You can be Asian, just don't be *too* Asian. Everyone else listens to English music blasted on the radio etc., but ehhhh dyou think you can tone down the Korean? It sounds a bit weird and like some bad words and we don't wanna put in the effort. North America says jump and the company says how high for exposure which still often amounts to sneering orientalism.

This entire issue puts a horrible taste in my mouth. All I can say is that I'm immensely disappointed. Asians need more representation in the West, [especially Asian men who are so completely underrepresented and desexed and horribly stereotyped](https://twitter.com/marjoriemliu/status/785531042451099648), but this isn't the total win some people seem to think it is. For me personally, this stings. *A lot*. And as an Asian, I can't overlook it or the way anti Asian racism happens and gets brushed over like this all the time as just something Asians need to put up with to make it or just not important instead of seen as the insidious serious issue it is.",37,41

This morning I saw someone declare that they were no longer sure if they were going to support A.C.E anymore because Jason changed his stagename from that to his actual name (Kim Byungkwan) and they were legitimately upset that they had done so because it apparently showed that it was inconsistent, it's a change in personality and its using a spelling that (to them) is incorrect (not realising that because of b.s Romanization rules, """" could be spelt sometimes either with a U or EO). It was so inane that I choked laughing on my cereal.

So, over to you. What are some Stan Twitter moments that made you go, ""huh??""",380,234

2102,2018-5-24,2018,5,24,11,8lp7tp,Which are the best kpop agencies? (Foreigners),K-PopDataGatherer,1527129170,"CONSIDERING...

- Artist freedom and control.
- Treatment (includes how freely they cant talk, not being too restricted, restriction of phones).
- Management
- Living Costs: whether they take care of your plane ticket, dorm, food, etc. 

Also, I'm curious about the quality of training in each company, but I'm not sure if anybody knows that.

IMO:
YG and RBW seem to be best for artistic freedom. The thing is RBW being a smaller company, it may not be as good for foreigners with limited resources (they may have to deal with more expenses than in bigger companies). Hence the Big3 are probably better for living costs. 
As for treatment JYP seems pretty good agency to me, they have sex &amp; ethics education, everybody seems to be on good terms, they've got (or rather will have) an organic cafeteria (okay, it doesn't say a lot but I like it).
And, finally, I think SM is best for management, but it's on the more strict side and, as seen by the criteria I've given, I'm looking for a more relaxed company (of course not TRULY relaxed, that's impossible on any decent company).

Anyway, what do you think?",1,0

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...


1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48 hours to check.

2196,2018-5-25,2018,5,25,2,8luhju,Videos on unpopular opinions [Warning I spilled my 20 y/o heart here],_freddytherookie,1527183033,"Now I do not know if it is only me who is getting a lot of suggested videos in my feed on Youtube titled ""Unpopular opinions on K\-Pop"" and it's variations. I would love to join the club \(with stating my opinions\) although I am not really a fan of those videos and you might ask why. Let me explain myself. 

I watched a good 10\-15 videos of this particular genre in the past week and I have to say that there is NOTHING unpopular about those opinions. Now if you say that your opinion is unpopular, that means that almost no\-one agrees with it. However, I found that those videos had the same stuff in them over and over again even though it came from different people. I do not think that people realize that when 1 or 2 people disagree with them, that it does not particularly mean the opinion is unpopular. I get that people just want to put those out to maybe find out other people's opinions, but in that case do not title it ""Unpopular opinions"". 

A majority of the video creators have stated that they think 3rd/4th generation of K\-Pop sucks, that it sound like generic American production etc. I have some things to say about this: You do not have to listen to the music you do not like just because it is K\-Pop and you feel like you have to be a loyal fan. If you do not like the sound of the song that your favorite artist has just put out, ignore it and listen to their older stuff.  Second of all, you are talking POP music, meaning it will still sound very similar since the sound is POPularised. Lastly, K\-Pop has never lost it's unique sound or flashiness that it \(supposedly used to have\) had during the era of the 2nd generation artists. It is still present, although I do not think people are looking in the right places. This way I want you to explore the wonders of B\-side tracks and less popular groups, since that is where the \(if you want to call it\) tradition is at.

I just wanted to clear out some possible mistakes on the fans' side when stating their negative relationship to the Korean music since it might be just because they do not want to see the originality on the K\-Pop scene anymore. If I am wrong and you just do not like the sound of it, that is completely okay, my bad. I apologize in advance if I am going to trigger someone with my point of view on those opinions \(and videos\), I just really wanted to give my opinion on it.   


Keep on supporting your faves folks! Cheers!   


SIDENOTE: Even though the videos are not really my cup of tea, some of them are made in a really funny and creative way so if you want to dig into them you might find some that will crack you up. ",0,0

I've recently gotten back into Kpop through Twice and I've seen claims that they're the new Nation's Girl Group. Since I'm not Korean and way biased, what is the criteria behind Nation's X Group? Album sales, megahit singles, general public knowledge? Is it just a marketing term to drum up even more sales? 

Do y'all think Twice is the Nation's Girl Group, especially if you're currently living in Korea? 

What about Nation's Boy Group? Big Bang seemed huge last time I was into Kpop but their on hiatus now. So whose claiming the title? Exo or BTS? 

I don't want a fan war over what bands deserve the title, just curious if there's some actual criteria for the term. ",99,23

Which is why I never understood why she keeps singing these minimalist, pop tracks where the focus is more on her body than her vocal prowess. Of course if that's what Hyolyn wants, more power to her but then we also know some in KPop do end up being placed in a box. 

Not exactly material but how come we never see Rose from Blackpink ever release solo stuff? She's the best singer in that group, has a vibratto that I find absolutely riveting to listen to yet none of the girls in Blackpink ever release solo material. Most girl bands have their members release solo stuff on the side. 

Hong Jin-Young. Just because I feel Trot is too limiting for someone with that much talent. Listening to her on King of Masked Singer was incredible. I'd love to see her do ballads or even a straight up pop single. She has experimented with both, her last release was a mix of Trot and Pop but what about just pop? ",80,51

2352,2018-5-26,2018,5,26,19,8m9caq,Kdrama actor and Kpop artist confession. If youre a fan of any Kceleb PLEASE READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH,jinshexedupworld,1527330919,"
Edit: I was pretty direct in my original post on my blog but after some thought I have gone back through and censored the actors and artists names just a bit. 

I have a story to tell. Not sure anyone will hear it. Not sure they will believe it or even care but Im going to tell it anyway because I have to get this off my chest.

I studied for a couple of years at uni abroad in Korea. Koreans for fucks sake are some of the most antisocial bunch if youre a foreigner I have to say. But thats not what this is about.  I happened to make friends with this one guy, Andrew. He is part Korean but also had lived in Britain somewhere or other too so he was more welcoming to me. Seeing as he was almost my only friend there we quickly became close. Nice guy, a bit on the quirky side and didnt talk much about his personal life to the point it was a little odd. He was very, very secretive. In fact the only really personal things he talked about was his job, school and the fact that he was a member of the LGBT community. When we would hang out it was always at my dorm or we would meet at a coffee shop or someplace. He never invited me to his place. I even got a wee bit frustrated with it and confronted him about it one day. He got more than a little nervous at that and made all these lame excuses about his room mates being busy and he didnt want to disturb them or that we wouldnt have much fun there. I was a bit annoyed at this but I let it slide. He was still a nice guy after all and my only close friend there and I enjoyed him. We had fun together. He was constantly getting texts and phone calls from people he called his friends or room mates. He even had a boyfriend that I knew literally nothing about!  I felt a little left out. I would ask about them or about meeting them and there was always some vague explanation about them and some excuse why we couldnt meet. At this point I had known him almost a year and still didnt even know their names!  Not even his boyfriends name! Then one day I asked to borrow his phone and he was unnecessarily protective of it. Yea I get it were all weird about anyone else having our phones but come on geez I was having transportation issues , had a dead phone battery and just needed to make a quick call. Long story short I get his phone and make my call. When I clicked end his contact list pops up and theres names in it I recognize. K-idol names. A mix of actors and Kpop artists. I just figure maybe hes some kind of fanboy and maybe he and his mysterious friends use celebrity name handles. Sorry but Kpop fans can be weird and obsessive sometimes, ya know?  And hes just a college boy. Who is he going to know really? Meanwhile Andrew had been distracted by someone he knew who had approached him and they were busy talking away. So my curiosity got the best of me and his screen hadnt gone black yet, I still had access. So I go on a little snooping spree through his phone trying my best to not look suspicious. Yes I know Im a bad person but Im human what can I say?  I kid you not, this guy has selca pics out the ass literally probably hundreds of himself with several Korean actors and idols. I couldnt even mentally take in all of them. I know there were many many with E members. I saw at least one with P H S I think his name is? The actor and Z guy and I think there was another Z member in one of them too if I remember right.  There were many with P B G, a few with N members, one with who I think was a B member and quite several with Y S H. Even several completely random mixed up ones.  I was nervous and hurrying faster than my brain can process but I specifically remember one of Andew, B B H, B G and S H and someone else I didnt recognize sitting on a couch laughing like they were having a grand ol time. Im not even much of a Kceleb person but that one shocked me.  He had another of K J D and B G together. And thats just the ones I seen before I got nervous about getting caught.  I have to say I was officially intrigued by him though after that. And they didnt seem like fan pics! Thats what got me most. They looked too comfortable. And they didnt look like they were taken at any sort of event, concert, fanmeet etc. They were all in normal clothes and sans makeup, in some they even had drink glasses and looked like they could have been in the comfort of their own home.

Over the next few months, Andrew did finally start talking to me about it more. He happened to be a childhood friend of a K celeb. Somehow it all snowballed from that. Now he lives with a few of them and is dating one. I wont go so far as to say which one but he has been for almost 3 years now. I found out he hides behind a fan account on Twitter under the name Guksu or JongdaesByuns  or Byunz maybe or some shit like that. Or thats what it used to be at least, I cant say for certain now.  I followed him for a bit before I deleted my Twitter account. I always found it funny he hid behind a fan account for all the people he actually knows.  He explained to me that he does it more so for the purpose of supporting those he knows personally and for defending them and speaking out against wrongdoings {Ill get to that shortly}, and from what I seen he really does. And of course when youre in uni theres always boredom and the need for time passing. And though I was never much of a Twitter person either, it certainly passes time when youre bored to death. Hes had several stalkers on there try to expose him. Fuck knows how they even knew because he always denies or is vague from what Ive seen.  And I even got to visit his house and meet a couple of these people . Those I mentioned above, maybe some others even Im not sure, are all associated with him. Ive never been a huge fan of K idols myself but I was around uni enough to recognize many, many of them and know some of their work. Its still kind of weird finding out celebrities are friends with other idols you never suspected they would be. Made me laugh myself a bit at all the stupid fuckin fanwars I would overhear at uni. Fuck if people only knew.  Im not going to say a lot of shit on here because I know how crazy Kfans are and no one will probably believe this shit anyway. Fuck I saw it for myself and I still am in shock so I wouldnt even blame anyone. But for what its worth, Im putting it out there. Believe it or dont, its whatever. Doesnt really change my life any either way except hoping I will feel better having put this out there.

Now onto my reasoning 

A few months ago I had to go back home and Andrew and I had a bit of a falling out before I left . Not going to get into that but we havent kept in contact since. But some of the things he told me still haunts me. About the Korean entertainment industry, both music and drama. The way these people are treated. I even heard it from two of them firsthand. There is so much I want to say but I have heard horror stories about what Korean entertainment companies do to people who speak out against them. I dont really want to risk that. But if any of you watch Kdrama or listen to Kpop I hope you will keep in mind the amount of suffering those idols go through for your entertainment. The working until they pass out or sick, then being pulled up off the ground and told to get back to work. {side story: I was at Andrews house one night when one of the above mentioned people called another asking for a ride home from a set because he had worked 70+ hours straight and passed out several times. } Caking on more and more makeup to hide the fact that they are deathly exhausted. The physical, mental and sexual abuse. Yes sexual. And Im not talking about isolated incidents. Im talking about these things being the daily lives of K actors and Kpop artists. And absolutely everything that gets said about them publicly are lies. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G-. If its in any way personally related to them and you hear it , then its a fucking publicity lie.  Where they live and their homes are lies. The cars they drive are lies. All set up. I mean considering how crazy and stalkery Kfans are and the fact that so many of them dont know their boundaries or respect privacy, because yes I have seen this for myself so this much I can understand. But it goes much deeper than that. They dont date who it is told to you that they date. This is probably the biggest one. Their real dating lives are kept creepily under lock and key and the relationship rumors all of you hear are always fake. A.L.W.A.Y.S.  Sometimes even marriages and family lives are fake and set up. More so if its an LGBT idol.  Its seriously crazy on the verge of psychotic how far its taken to control these idols lives. And its because everything is considered a scandal in Korea. And fans go crazy over absolutely everything and drop and shit talk their idols over the most ridiculous shit.  So these places they are contracted with go to extreme measures to have complete control over what the public knows. Some of them are gay, maybe a lot of them. But hey guys in the entertainment industry are much more likely to be gay I will tell you that now. I was in theater in middle school, high school and uni for close to 10 years and I probably knew less than 5 males in it that whole time who were NOT gay, or claimed they werent anyway.  Gay men love the arts industries. Not trying to be stereotypical but its kind of a fact. And theyre good at it! So there ya go. I know how anti-LGBT Kfans tend to be so let me tell you, get yourself the fuck over it cause you have gay idols. Probably many.  You being hard on them over that is just making their already miserable lives even worse.

My only real reason for posting this is to just get all that shit off my chest. Im not doing this for attention because honestly I couldnt give two fucks in space what Kfans think. I dont listen to Kpop or watch Kdramas and since I am no longer in Korea Im not really exposed to it much at all so I dont give a flying fuck what the fans of it think of me. And I dont care to or have time for dealing with their crazy asses.  I do want people to know what their idols go through for them just because I think its really fucked up and you all should know if you actually do care about these people.   I wont be responding to any replies or answering questions so dont waste your time. I needed to get this out there, simple as that.  I have lived carrying this with me for awhile now. It gets heavy guys. Really fucking heavy. It just makes me sick that human beings have to endure slave-like lives for those companies and theres really nothing we can do about it. Fuck its 2018 and this shit still goes on. I doubt this post will even get anyones attention but I guess in the very least I got it off my chest.

Edit:  Yea I know I maybe just exposed him myself but I dont even know that hes still active anymore. I havent had my Twitter account in quite some time. And he doesnt use his full name or say much on there personally anyway so Im not too worried. And like I said, we had a falling out so take that as you will.

Also a final side note for anyone who read this all the way through and isnt too busy bitching me out: I have seen some of them scrolling through his Twitter profile/feed/whatever before. Several times actually. So yeah they do fuckin see the things you post.",5,0

##Let You Go Today

There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community. - Proverbs 6:16-19

From Wikipedia: 

&gt; The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions.

When I asked what theme you wanted for this Jukebox, 44% of you voted for The Seven Deadly Sins, so here are your seven songs.

Their entire mini-album is just too amazing for me to even describe in words. Only One is legit one of the most amazing songs I've heard ever (not just this year) and it just stuns me that that particular song isn't getting the recognition it should.

From appearing on top-rated television staples like *Ellen* and *The Late Late Show with James Corden* to winning back-to-back trophies at the Billboard Music Awards to debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart, it seems like the sky is the limit for our boys. They're breaking all kinds of records, and IMHO now is the most exciting time to be a K-pop fan.

**What do you think are the biggest contributing factors to BTS' success in the United States?** Many K-pop acts have tried to break into the American music industry over the years, but none ~~with the exception of PSY~~ have come quite as far as BTS. **Why are they excelling, but so many others failed?** I know that BTS isn't exactly a household name in America, but they have the greatest chances of success among all active K-pop artists.

And speaking of success, **where do you think BTS will go from here?** **Will even more K-pop groups or soloists try to make an American advancement now?** **What can they learn from BTS' journey?**",53,4

Or what is one you are looking forward to?

For me, there are two shows that were just amazing. The first was the BigBang Made Tour show in Los Angeles, my first Kpop concert and one that was beyond anything I had expected. Their performance was so professional, they appeared to have a great time and it solidified my love for kpop and the culture around it. The second was the AOMG show in Seattle, the small venue of the Showbox and my first high touch made everything so personal. The artists were so close and it felt at times like I was getting a private concert. 

I'm looking forward to seeing BTS in September, I know they will live up to their hype and it will be another amazing show, but at the same time I'm nervous for whatever reason. ",55,41

The stock market estimates Big Hit's business value to be worth over 1 TRILLION won \($922,200,000\)

The K\-pop industry has officially begun analyzing BTS' success &amp; is trying to learn from it. One famous agency has even created a task force. Acc to industry insiders, there were many differences behind BTS' extraordinary success that broke stereotypes about the K\-pop market

# 1- Strength of BTS' music is the universality of their message &amp; the combination of genres that is a good read of the trend in the music industry - connected school, youth, LY w their story=storytelling - message in BTS music much broader than other groups' about joy&amp;sorrow

From growing pains of youth, societal issues, criticism of older generation&amp; hierarchy\- touched on things that may be taboo for idol singers, inspired by literature \(1Q84, Demian, Omelas\)lyrics have universal validity that millennial gen can relate to beyond language &amp; borders

# 2- Friendly/approachable communication=spread of BTS' music &amp; message through YouTube,SNS(social media). These platforms were a key point of success that enhanced their familiarity and accessibility

Communicating on SNS isn't something that set BTS apart\-most idols use SNS. However, BTS' way of operating their SNS showed the beauty of doing it in a way that wasn't stereotypical of the K\-pop market

Instead of the process, many agencies only show the ""completed"" content. Singers met w the public when their singing&amp;dancing were perfect in full makeup&amp; outfits. But BTS showed their process, and unrefined, daily lives and approached fans like friends. Honestly w sincerity.

# 3- Decentralization &amp; Globalization= in terms of online communication, BTS corrected the notion of ""Korean success=overseas success"" For a while, the K-pop industry thought that you had to succeed in Korea to become global.

As if it was an official pattern, agencies threw themselves into promotions in Korea and did the ""required course"" of trying to become more recognized through appearances on music &amp; variety shows. Success in Korean market was key so you had to ""wait"" to enter the overseas markets

On the contrary, BTS focused online more than broadcasts &amp; earned a wider range of fans from many different countries. At the beginning of their debut, they were from small\-company idols who got cut from shows, but they stepped away from stereotypes &amp; brought forth globalization

Director of an agency said, ""It's not easy to return to the domestic market after succeeding overseas, so we didn't dream about it for awhile. From the proposition that you can become global, BTS' Billboard success brought a huge change to our perception.""",6,28

2717,2018-5-30,2018,5,30,12,8n5i7h,SM upcoming girl group White Fox Concept,JJ960,1527652216,"Ive been thinking about this ever since Ive heard the name and heres my take on what the concept could be. 

The color of White is associated with light, goodness, innocence, purity, and virginity. It is considered to be the color of perfection. White means safety, purity, and cleanliness.

While a fox is usually an animal thats known for being Subtle. Flamboyance is usually not the fox's style, preferring to remain inconspicuous in choose subtlety and cunning over brute strength.

So in other words...

White Fox- innocent yet cunning, pure yet savage, and sweet yet fierce 

I know the new/upcoming girl group name is now Moonlight Angels but I think White Fox would still be an amazing concept to see because the two names contradict, yet it would work well for the concepts this group could take on.",1,1

Not mine, but for example AOA's new song doing well right out the gate. Since ChoA left, all that people could talk about was she was central to their music and since their declining sales and charting, her exit could be the final coffin.

And yet the song has been charting well even with good competition from BB4, BTS, and SHINee. In fact, it seems to be their best chart debut since Heartattack in 2015. Don't quote me on that though",152,143

I was slightly disappointed by AOA since Heart Attack and Excuse Me are some of my favorite girl group songs :(

Similarly, when BP and Mamamoo released AIITYL and Yes I Am respectively, I preferred Mamamoo's song because the MV stood out more. AIITYL is a jam though.

So for songs that came out on the same day by different idols, which one was your favorite?",3,6
