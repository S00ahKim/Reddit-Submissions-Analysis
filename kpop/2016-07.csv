For me I would like some talent which i feel like is kinda unrecognized, two I have in mind are:

*[Kim Hyeong Eun, KCONIC trainee, P101 member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSccT2xpmGU#t=1m10s)
Although she did prove her rapping skill in the show scoring 1st place in the rapping section, I feel like she is kinda overshadowed by other rappers on the show. (Im Nayoung, Jeon Soyeon) So I would really like to see her get some recognition.

*[Choi Rin from Almeng, appeared in KPOPSTAR3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XNZWrVcfg)
Not even sure if she fits under the ""Rapper"" category however I really like her, again i feel like Almeng is a little underappreciated and thought it would be kinda cool to have her on the show",70,19

* I got to see everyone's beauty in person - not the white washed, photoshopped performance that I am accustom to.

* I got to witness and hear the talent in real life which only gave me a deeper appreciation for it.

* I got to choose which member to follow/watch instead of looking where the camera wanted me to look.

* With my light stick and other friendly fans, I felt connected to strangers. We were all one K-Pop family sharing in this wonderful experience together.

* I got to sing along loudly and let my K-Pop flag fly without judgement.

So, without further ado, here are our picks for May and June 2016!

---

[Ballad/Electronic] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - Meow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtX1IBflUI)

&gt; Best artist in Korea at the moment? I think so! Gingee released her debut song [The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys) back in January of this year and Meow, her second release, is just as good! Her voice is AMAZING! Just a week ago she released an unfinished demo track called [Narara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UIpxA5GK3U) and it sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. She's definitely one to keep an eye on for the future. - /u/nokel

[Hip Hop] [Futuristic Swaver - Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otFuKz9bzsA)

&gt; Dude looks nerdy as hell but he's got some swag. The beat in this song is top tier and Swaver's flow is great as always (and less polarizing than his 'cloud rap' songs). - /u/nokel

[Electro Pop] [Aseul - Fisher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnY5pnbLJF0)

&gt; After years of waiting, Yukari (now ""Aseul"") is finally back! This is my favorite song off of her album ""New Pop"" and imo is the most reminiscent of her dream pop album ""Echo"". - /u/nokel

[Instrumental] [Roy C. -  ](https://youtu.be/F3hB9LqVzHY)

&gt; Very calming. Kind of reminds me on [Doxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f_z60CSNEc) in a lot of ways. - /u/nokel

[Indie Rock] [we hate jh - ](https://youtu.be/cx9wPZchZUM)

&gt; Hands down the best Indie Rock song I've heard all year. The singer is fantastic and the song overall is catchy as hell! - /u/nokel

[Pop Rock] [The Electriceels) - Equator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVV8ksdTxM)

&gt; Pretty fun summer song. I'm not a big pop rock guy but this one's pretty good! Also, the chorus reminds me of [HOT - Candy](https://youtu.be/_C7Fx2KpAKs?t=1m33s). - /u/nokel

[ (Heize) - Shut Up &amp; Groove (Feat. DEAN)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=sk6WiGOmlso)

&gt;it's groove is just really contagious and is such a good song to have on while driving late at night. - /u/eyebrowsintensify

Sure, you can pick almost any letter and name a few popular groups that begin with it, but there seems to be an abundance of kpop boy bands that begin with B... I'm sure I'm leaving some out, but case in point: Big Bang, Block B, BTS, Beast, B1A4, B.A.P., BtoB...  (hangul considered, VIXX may also count)


Is this a coincidence or is there something lucky or marketable about the letter 'B'?  I can't be the first one to point this out, can I?",19,28

217,2016-7-4,2016,7,4,11,4r5046,[Discussion/Reviews] So I Married an Anti-Fan (Chinese film starring EXO's Chanyeol and SNSD's Seohyun),af-fx-tion,1467597801,"The Breakdown:

**Film Name:** *So I Married an Anti-Fan* (also known as *No One's Life is Easy* in the USA/Canada)

**Based On:** Korean novel of the same name by Kim Eunjung (there is also a manhwa adaptation by Wann)

**Starring:** Chanyeol (of EXO), Yuan Shanshan, Seohyun (of SNSD), and Jiang Chao

**Locations of Theaters where film is showing in USA/Canada:** [link](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ck8FMrhVEAAhBPs.jpg)

**Premise:** Lee Geun-Yeong (Yuan Shanshan) is a wannabe author who works as a gossip writer in order to pay the bills. She eventually gets fired after trying to reveal the secrets of popular Hallyu star Hoo Joon (Chanyeol). Blaming him for all her subsequent problems, Geun-Yeong becomes his anti-fan, but after a series of events which puts her in direct contact with Hoo Joon, will her perception of him change? And will his view toward her change as well?

**Overall Rating: 6/10**

**SPOILERS**

**Review:** Overall, I thought the movie was average. Not amazing, but not bad either. Honestly, I feel like the film would have worked better as a drama, because the film didn't have enough ""meat"" in explaining why Geun-Yeong and Hoo Joon fell in love with each other - friends yes, but in love? No. And this is a film that clocked in at 2 hours. A drama would have given the plot more wiggle room to breathe.

It was hard to judge Chanyeol's acting here. It seemed like he wasn't super proficient in Mandarin at the time of the film being shot, because it looked like he was saying in lines in Korean, but was dubbed in Mandarin (he may have dubbed himself though in post-production, as a clip shown during the credits show him recording lines for the film in Mandarin in the soundbooth). Also, due to Chanyeol's character having many similarities to his own life in the spotlight, it just seemed like he was playing a jerky, exaggerated version of himself. 

Also, Seohyun is barely in the film, so fans hoping to see her featured a lot will be disappointed. She's really only in about 3-4 scenes in the whole film. She's also very underwritten - her character has like 3 lines and we don't really get her motivation for her actions throughout the film. Is she trying to detroy Hoo Joon's life, is she just a lover of stirring drama? I don't know. Seohyun does say her lines in Mandarin though.

However, Yuan Shanshan was a bright spot in the film. She was funny, and was able to really ground the story as an ""everywoman"" who gets swept up in the crazy and cutthroat culture of celebrity. As a sidenote, when her character gets a ""makeover"", she looks a lot like Lim from Wonder Girls...which seriously led to a bit of confusion every now and then when watching the film.

A note on the subtitles, only dialogue is translated, written text shown on screen is not, which causes one late game plot point to have a delayed reveal for English speakers due to it revolving around an article Geun-Yeong wrote earlier in the film. There are a few grammatical/tense errors as well (Geun-Yeong is referred to as *Mr.* Lee at one point), but overall the subtitles were coherent and allowed for a good understanding of what was happening on screen.

Hopefully a director's cut/extended version comes out, as I think additional scenes between Geun-Yeong and Hoo Joon would give the film more of the romantic heft it needed in the theatrical cut.

I bought tickets for my first kpop concert last week(Seventeen in Auckland, NZ. Yay!) but am slightly nervous about going since I'm not really the target demographic. Just worried I might stick out like a sore thumb, especially at the high touch event. I suffer anxiety unfortunately.
My apologies if this is a bit silly to make a post about, but just wanted to get your thoughts. Also I hope this's in the right sub, please re direct me otherwise.

Another thing, as part of the concert GOT7 goes into the crowd for one of the ending songs so please be careful for the safety of those around you and the boys.

As some people are aware on FB groups, some girls were let in the show with no tickets near the end of the concert at the Rosemont (Chicago) stop. If you see that happening tell a subkulture rep, because it isn't fair for those who paid their ticket. 
Many of us after the concert overheard some girls talking that they got in for free by a staff member and they were taken to the very front (pit). I think it is very unfair considering how much people pay for pit. So please just be aware if you see any people sneak into PIT, etc. 

Overall have fun! It's a great show even from the balcony ",46,83

It all started when my girlfriend left me for another guy and then shortly after I lost my job. It being my first (and long, 1 1/2 yrs) relationship, I've taken the breakup really hard. I know I can always find a new job, it's just that having so much free time leaves me with so much time to think about my ex. I know time will heal this wound, but for now, I don't know how to cope. I'm in an awful spot mentally and emotionally. I don't like falling asleep because I always end up dreaming of my ex which causes me to wake up early and not want to fall asleep again. I don't like waking up because I don't have anything to do or even feel like I have a purpose. When I do eventually drag myself out of bed, I always turn my computer on and the first thing I do is call my friends on skype and click on the first kpop MV I see on my youtube homepage. They're the only two things I look forward to throughout my day and make me feel like I'm okay. The weekends are usually my best days because new subbed episodes of WGM and SMTM are released. Watching the happy couples do romantic things makes me feel great and, surprisingly, keeps my mind off of my ex. Whenever I feel like I'm having a worse day than usual, I always look at these gifs of Irene. They make me feel warm inside. She's easily my bias out of the whole industry. She's so pretty and I love her (nonchalant yet slightly awkward?) personality!

It wasn't until I was driving home this morning, and Rough by GFriend came on, that I realized how much of an important role Kpop plays in my life. I instantly felt better as soon as it came on (and I feel even better when I actually watch the MV, they're SO pretty!). Kpop has always been my go to thing when I'm feeling down and, unlike my ex girlfriend, has never let me down before. It's always there, and I'm so grateful to have discovered it. It's like the shimmering light in my days filled with darkness. On top of that, the kpop community is great! You guys rock!! Sorry if this is a bit random or against the rules but typing this all out has made me feel much better.

Edit - Thanks to everyone that has shared or is going to share. Relating to people who have been in a similar situation has made me feel so much better and has really made my day. You guys are awesome.",104,326

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

~~~~

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)

498,2016-7-7,2016,7,7,10,4rlv96,K-Pop songs that sound similar or reminds you of other songs?,RedVelvetGod,1467853749,"We all had that moment of ""Man this song sounds good but I swear I've heard it before"". 

I had that moment today with the [Wonder Girl's song ""Why So Lonely""](https://youtu.be/PYGODWJgR-c) track they put out (which I've been playing nonstop btw) reminds me of [""Rude"" by MAGIC!](https://youtu.be/PIh2xe4jnpk) just a tad bit in the chorus. 

Another example would be the main riff of [Red Velvet's - ""Time Slip""](https://youtu.be/J9wqjEBHmMY) and [Iggy Azalea's - ""Fancy""](https://youtu.be/B0yOzQjYSmQ)

Now obviously they're written in similar styles so they would sound similar. Rude sounds like a million other songs as well but they've played it a million times here in America which is why it came to me.

Try to provide links for the lazy in your posts please.

582,2016-7-8,2016,7,8,1,4rpd1l,GOT7 #FLYinNYC Day 1 and 2 recap,messymessy1,1467907756,"Hi guys, I wanted to write this post for iGOT7's who were unable to attend the concerts the past few days. I luckily bought p1 and p2 for both days (it's my birthday don't judge me and I didn't waste the p2 tickets, I gave them to friends who let me keep the wristbands and just wanted to enjoy the show) and I wanted to let you all know how the event went for myself so others who will be attending the shows in different cities know what to expect. 

1. First of all, Subkulture Ent really went all out for this. Yes, the show was slightly messy (due to what I would like to label the sasaeng fans of America) but I'm really happy with the way they handled the wristband process and lines. It was a very smooth transaction, you'll show them your ticket, they'll mark off what time/number your ticket was purchased, put their initials on the ticket to show that you indeed did check in and then wrist band you accordingly. 

2. I am amazed that Subkulture went all out by providing snapchat geolocation filters for the show. It was an extremely precious and unnecessary thing they did for the fans. They also give you these cute banners with the fly fan chant on the back while you wait on line to practice before the show if you wanted to. I unfortunately did not keep any because they didn't survive the pit :(

3. The pit was a distater. I have been in a lot of pits and seriously, this pit was almost as bad as being in a Warped Tour pit, hell it might be *just as bad* as a warped tour pit. Bambam and Mark had to stop the show a few times due to the fact it was just getting way out of hand and they kindly asked people to take a few steps back before resuming the show (which no one low key did -___-) so it was a very very difficult time. Please let me know if other city pits were like this as well! I was so sad because I didn't want GOT7 to see how scary their fan base can be up close. Like you can definitely tell the boys were slightly taken aback because the people in the front were really really squished (me included) and at one point started chanting 5 steps back because it was just that bad. But if you make it through, don't tap out and stand your ground, I promise it's worth it. A slight PSA to pit goers, please please please respect other people in the pit. Yes, I know you want a chance to touch them, yes I know you want ""oppa"" to notice you, and yes I know you want photos but it is unnecessary to elbow people in the rips, backs etc and rudely use strangers around you as elbow rests for your photos. 

4. The concert itself is amazing. Like, the boys energy is amazing. They had a very very strong set for a full 2.5 hours and it was great. You're in for a wild ride like its illegal how great they are. Spoiler: They do a remix of FLY and it's a certified BANGER. JYP did an excellent job in planning their first tour in America. 

5. If their stage presence (spot?) is the same at all cities I'll give you a heads up where to stand to see your bias as frequently as you can. Keep in mind they do make their way around the stage but this is where I saw they mostly standing on both days. 
LEFT STAGE: mostly Youngjae, Mark, Junior. 
MIDDLE: Junior, Bambam, JB 
RIGHT: Jackson, Mark, Yugyeom 

6. P1/P2 benefits (I had slight tunnel vision so I might be forgetting the rest): 
P1 Photo Pass - the show ends, I'm waiting in line looking like a straight up sweaty mess, everyone is fixing their makeup (me included lol). The doors open, the line starts moving. You enter through the doors in groups of 10. There's a backdrop, the boys are all standing, chairs in front of them. You sit where you pick (I was in front of Jackson both days because I am 100% Jackson trash), the photo gets taken you're escorted out. If you want to say something nice to them be very quick about it but please do not touch them. Some girl tried to pull Youngjae into a hug after and he was slightly frazzled but thank god security had a hold on her in time. Don't ruin their experience, and don't ruin every other fans either. The second day, Jackson remembered me and gave me a shoulder squeeze (yes, I'm deceased)

P2 Hi Touch - my experience is a little different since no one actually thought a P1 person would have P2 as well. So they had to escort me back to the main room where everyone was waiting but did so through the doors that were RIGHT by the boys. So they saw me again, and Junior who was closest to me bowed in thanks for my support. The other boys were waving. You wait on line again, you finally enter through the door and the boys are all in a line with their hands out. SPEAK FAST IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING AS YOU PASS YOUR BIAS. Security will grab you if you hold up the line (D2). By far my favorite hi touch event as someone who hates hi touch because it feels like such a short time for the price. The second day was similar but they learned and escorted me through a different set of doors away from the boys (sigh). It was much more tense like Day 1 security were much nicer Day 2 will put their hands on you. I was wishing everyone a safe flight and when I reached Jackson, he had said something to me and we exchanged a few words but before I could thank him after, security grabbed me for ""holding up the line"". I didn't even get to hi touch Junior who was the person after Jackson which slightly upset me since being manhandled by the security made me trip on the table cloth. Thankfully, Junior had tried to stabilize me before I really made a fool out of myself. 

Hi Touch line up: Mark, Yugyeom, Bambam, Jb, Youngjae, Jackson, Junior. 

There are a few more details I am omitting because some I just want to keep to myself and some I honestly don't remember. I hope all iGOT7's enjoyed/will enjoy their concert, because I sure as hell did. I will be uploading a video of their show on YouTube later (I took a shit ton of videos and photos) for people who wanted to see the show but might have been unable to. Please let me know if that's something you'd want me to link later! Also excuse any typos, I'm on mobile.

Please note that information on some (Miryo, who debuted in 1999) is easier to find than others (Kassy, who debuted in 2015), and no bias is intended. Please feel free to contribute any information it appears that I have missed.

**Miryo** 

Miryo [debuted with Honey Family in 1999]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIx8Dsz3PqA), but was only a member through 2000, through their second album. One thing I found particularly interesting about her work (and others from the same time), was that since this was produced before Verbal Jint blew up, it does not feature a modern rhyme scheme.

After leaving Honey Family, she was a featuring artist for several artists between 2000 and 2006, [such as MC Mong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0VKPsHwwew)

After being approached by JeA, she debuted in 2006 with Brown Eyed Girls (Jea, Narsha, Miryo, and Gain) with the song [Come Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh5oSPXlCPI)

Brown Eyed Girls steadily grew in popularity until 2009, when they skyrocketed in popularity with the legendary song [Abracadabra]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y)

She participated in the first season of Show Me The Money as one of the veteran rappers, [but was eliminated in the fourth episode]( http://www.allkpop.com/article/2012/07/brown-eyed-girls-miryo-sheds-tears-after-a-regretful-performance-on-show-me-the-money)

She has released two solo albums: [MIRYO aka JOHONEY]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjr485xFf7A) and [Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2WLoex71wk)

[This year, Brown Eyed Girls became the first girl group to celebrate their tenth anniversary with no lineup changes](http://www.soompi.com/2016/03/02/brown-eyed-girls-celebrate-10-year-debut-anniversary-with-fans/)




**Ha Joo Yeon (Baby J)** 

 Baby J debuted in 2007 with the single [Discovering Our Sound]( http://channel.pandora.tv/channel/video.ptv?ch_userid=ulsanyonhapclub&amp;prgid=32359943), which shares its name with [a famous traditional Jindo song]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys-uSTA9XuM )

In 2008, Baby J joined Jewelry for their promotions for [Kitchi Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQSMcWAdC0I)

She released another solo in 2009 [Bang! Love at First Sight (remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zoX92QHxVg/), a remix of [this extremely addicting song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdUCgnmUMRw)

Though she was not a member of Jewelry at the time of disbandment, she was a member during their last promotions in 2013, [Hot and Cold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdabIfmtgk)

She did not perform much if any after leaving Jewelry, until recently when she auditioned for [Show Me The Money 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmO2lJVhBog). In the pre-audition interview, she revealed the hardships she has gone through since then, and how she missed the stage

**Yuk Jidam** 

*Mildangyeo is baaack*
 
We original met Yuk Jidam in [Show Me The Money 3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmwbGayUISE)

She was eliminated [after this performance]( http://www.ondemandkorea.com/odk-clips-show-me-the-money3-e05-clip-2411.html?lang=en) , which earned her the nickname mildangyeo.

We saw her again in the first season of Unpretty Rapstar, where she redeemed herself of the mildangyeo moniker, reaching third place overall. 

She won the [first track, produced by Zico]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLqW-mUD2RM)

During the semi-finals stage performance [On &amp; On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9MgWodzAHk), she raps about the struggles of growing up being bullied for her dark skin, and how [Tasha Ts song Black Happiness]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0_dCn7gZXg) inspired her to start rapping.

After the season ended, she [featured in a song on Hyunas most recent solo album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGmbKgVBUY)

I could only find one solo track since the end of Unpretty Rapstar on her [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/6jidam)

However! She featured in an [OST with Red Velvet's Wendy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mNG6hncx2c) Credit to /u/shortbrowngirl98



**Jeon Soyeon**

Soyeon has been a Cube trainee for a little under two years. 

She participated in *Produce 101!* where she gained a lot of popularity, but did not become a member of I.O.I. 

[My personal favorite Soyeon performance from Produce 101!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vgsUi4R38k)as the track is also a moment of Unpretty Rapstar history, [Gilme vs. Truedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBETjaUfpmo)




**Euna Kim**
 
She got her start when she participated in [Superstar K3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNAtqeO4OM)

She also attracted some fans as a trainee under YG, but ended up leaving, citing [""At the time, I wasn't ready spiritually, nor was I ready to sing or dance. ](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/04/yuna-kim-talks-about-why-she-left-yg-entertainment)

She released a solo, [Without You Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTXbTKnuUn4) featuring MFTBY, and did a duet with Minju [Good Bye Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_TRlWiqH08). Credit to /u/4nialove

She debuted in 2015 as a member of The Ark with the song [The Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-cOZgaotPY) under Music K Entertainment, though the group was very short-lived.

**Nada**

Before her debut, Nada had a cameo role in [Hyunas Ice Cream video](http://31.media.tumblr.com/3360dc803ce3f164baafcaede7b03d6e/tumblr_mre4182qep1rs0swmo1_500.gif), as well as B1A4s [Baby Good Night]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSSRkKtCEAETPWz.png)

She is a member of Wa$$up, who debuted in 2013 with the song [Wa$$up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_rKhU2vM), a song which, though banging, earned them notoriety as a twerking group.

She released her (hopefully) [first solo mixtape](https://soundcloud.com/nada_official/sets/nada-homework-1st-mixtape) this year.


**Grace**

Grace debuted under YYAC Friend with the song [Im Fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT_jL5rRxW8 )

She has also released some covers on her official Youtube,[ showing her talents as a singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37TLd9-TPo8)

I could go into more detail, [but I will let her do that herself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVvAGeFnz_s).

She also did an [AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4dz2v2/hey_this_is_grace_ask_me_anything/) Credit to /u/MyQuiescence for the find.


**Giant Pink**

Giant Pink is a newbie on the scene, with no known recordings or performances under her belt before her Show Me the Money 5 performance.

She managed to make it to the third round of[ as one of 2 female rappers](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/05/spoiler-show-me-the-money-5-releases-full-list-of-contestants-who-made-it-to-the-3rd-round), though she was a low pass, and did not make it past the third round.

She participated in the [Mystic Entertainment All I Know 360 VR Cypher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P0TEMCIwoo&amp;feature=youtu.be) after SMTM5. 


**Janey** 

Janey debuted as a member of GP Basic with their debut single [Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fRiodadcBI)

Though the age of the group as a whole was controversial (the average was 13.5), Janeys age (11) prevented her from performing on music shows during promotions for Game, and earned her the nickname The Maknae of K-Pop.

She left the group in 2015 after promotions for [Pika Burnjuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoEea7x-cm0)

She auditioned for Show Me The Money 5 where [she made it to the second round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfx3L-YmyQU)

[She has also done some acting](http://www.hancinema.net/korean_drama_The_Queen__s_Classroom-cast.html)

**Kassy**

She debuted last year with the song [In My Bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYYvPnmf2Q), which showcases both her singing and rapping talents. 

Though she has not been active very long, she has already participated in an [SM Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpH6OxXrMs).

677,2016-7-8,2016,7,8,23,4ruu0c,Can we please stop having individual music show performances be allowed? Especially if there is already a megathread for it?,Uanaka,1467986967,"Kind of as a title says. I know some people might only want to click on their bias group's performance, but if there is already someone compiling all of the performances together and putting it into a larger megathread... is it really necessary for people to be allowed to just post individual performances? Sure people can post performances from variety shows and radio shows, cause those aren't usually covered by the music show threads, but I don't need to have to scroll through 15 Music Bank posts to get to the next article. 

If anyone actually has a compelling reason as to why individual music show performances should be allowed, please enlighten me.",17,9

But recently I'm in China and I am pretty curious of China's view on Red Velvet. And I have to say, as a Chinese I am pretty disgusted of the Kpop fans of my own nation. 

note: Images take incredibly long to upload in China so imma just provide the links and translation. Translations are tl;dr and a bit rough


So first when I searched up Red Velvet I was dismayed to see that the ratio of members between RV's fansite and their Anti's fansite is a stunning 6:1

After some research I discovered the source of hate: A rumor of Seulgi dating Baehyun back when they were trainees and Seulgi breaking up with BK because she ""saw no potential in him. This enraged a lot of Chinese EXO-Ls and transferred a lot of hate towards Seulgi and subsequently RV.

* Exhibit 1: http://zhidao.baidu.com/link?url=Pv_i_GD-4qECNsRIf0i-g3vNHhhdUxPPT2NGq2fobX5sShuh-7zzxaXojxWBQf0TcFGJAsFUVsrvGRNNaqtIhDEL8rxX_y8_mPwHi7IFL1u

&gt;  Why is Kang Seulgi so hated?

&gt;""Kang Seulgi's just a bitch, disregarding Baekhyun. Shameless. Acting up even before debut. Warning you, don't come to China, nice standards for boyfriends but watch your eyes. If you don't we might stab them (+188, -60)""

&gt;""It's just a rumor, Seulgi and Baekhyun's relationship is pretty unlikely. Also SM's a large company so they wouldn't do this. Seulgi's dancing and singing is pretty nice. Just from a neutral opinion. Not a RV fan (+459. -705)""

&gt;""Seulgi ditched BK even tho they were dating and after BK got famous in EXO she came crawling back to him wanting to make up (+713, -194)""

&gt;""LMAO, Seulgi and BK have no relationships at all. It's just a rumor between Chinese Antis, Korea's heard nothing of this. People are really funny and actually believe this crap. Some PPL became antis just listening to unproven rumors. SG's a trainee since 2007 and she's worked her way up, was a trainee longer than even some sunbaenims. +655, -1404

* Exhibit 2:
http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/982052613342750579.html?qbl=relate_question_0&amp;word=%BA%DAredvelvet

&gt;There's a new girl group by SM named ""Lavender"" (Back before RV's name was finalized) and a really disgusting member named Kang Seulgi

&gt;""Rumor has it that she broke up with Baekhyun and after he got famous she wanted to get back together.......(similar stuff)....Fellow EXO-Ls, do your best to spread the word, we have to do something for our EXO Oppas!""

* Exhibit 3:
http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/1604595491499019987.html?qbl=relate_question_0&amp;word=%BA%DAredvelvet

&gt;The new girl group from SM died before they debuted, Kang Seulgi's shameless why does Kim Yerim even support her.....

&gt;""I don't really like them either considering SM got all the sunbaenim groups to pave the way for them(+1417, -52)




So yeaaaa like how did it even come to this? My concern is not the rumor itself but the flippancy the Chinese EXO-L shows.

Discuss?

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2: tru im a RV fan and moreover Seulgi's my bias (hence why i found this shitshow). But I'm not a EXO anti. I love their songs and I'm a fan too. ",46,36

I'm not so sure if posting their numbers to millions of followers reflects well on her. I mean, sure they are harassing her but didn't she just open up all these callers to the same harassment she experienced? And we all know how dangerously hateful and unreasonable fans can get. Would she be responsible to what happens to these callers? I could go on forever about the implications that comes along with posts like these but to me, this just seems very irresponsible of her. I'm not here to defend the people harassing her but this 'eye for an eye' thing just seems way below how a celebrity idol should be acting.",43,0

827,2016-7-10,2016,7,10,20,4s54rj,Short Fan Account - Taeyeon Butterfly Kiss 2nd Concert,Elnathan,1468149953,"I just got back from the second Butterfly Kiss concert. I'm a 30 year old male from the west, so I had no clue what to expect. I just wanted to see Taeyeon. Now that I have seen her, I would just recommend everyone interested in Taeyeon to try and get a ticket for the Busan show if you can.

During the show I wanted to clap more. That's what we usually do where I'm from. But there was almost no clapping. There was wooing, waving, chanting and random fangirl or fanboy shouting. One fan actually sang Taeyeon a birthday song. Near the end of the concert (and as per the concert instructions) ""Kim Taeyeon"" was chanted for almost five minutes. Then she appeared 3 meters behind me, and proceeded to roll around the stadium on a trolly, while singing TTS Twinkle.

Overall, the show was fantastic. Really meticulous. Taeyeon is just so so so good at what she does. I think her solo career is going to flourish. The way she goes from complete dork during the intermissions, to seducing everyone with her hip sway when performing is really something.

Tiffany, Sooyoung and Yoona came to watch. Which made me 100% regret not buying a ticket in the C section. Dean was there for Starlight, and also go to perform a song of his own.

The best performances in my opinion where Why, I, and Gee. Yes, she did Gee. Actually, everyone did Gee. 

I'll answer any questions if you have any.",19,80

I finally put the nugu list together! It took way longer than I thought, especially since I decided to add years active... Some might be incorrect, and more groups than listed may have disbanded. But since they're so unknown it's hard to find reliable information. Also, as I mentioned above, there were a few groups I didn't know if I should put in the list or not. Some groups are more nugu than others. I haven't listened to all of them, so if I accidentally added something weird, please let me know!",32,50

I think the general consensus from everyone I've heard from is that the experience is fantastic no matter where you were in the venue, but I really wanna hear what you all thought. Good or Bad experiences welcome, although I haven't heard many bad things.

Personally, I had a fantastic time, my seat was at the very edge of the stage but I jumped to the center at times. My whole experience was documented on my [twitter.](https://twitter.com/baekhyunsbuns/status/749296405714382848) The only things I deleted were the video Mark took on my phone, and the selfie that Bambam took with my section. Overall a great time, even if Youngjae wasn't at my stop of the tour. Seriously can't wait til they come back. Props to SubK and Got7 for an unforgettable time.

1035,2016-7-13,2016,7,13,2,4sid0c,[Discussion] f(x) Victoria posts controversial image regarding PRC's claims in South China Sea,chaomian,1468345965,"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHwi0S3jsIG/ the post in question.

This issue might not be of interest to many users on this sub, but it is highly controversial and if you read the comments on the post, it's bringing out a lot of ugly racial tensions and nationalism. 

For more information, the image depicts the [nine-dash line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dash_line), which marks the PRC's claim to a major part of the South China Sea. The image was posted in response to this development 

&gt;On 12 July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague gave a landmark ruling stating that The People's Republic China has no legal basis for its claim over the nine dash line in a case brought by the Philippines. The court judged that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources. **The ruling however was rejected by China.**

Many fans are expressing hurt and disappointment with Victoria over her (among many other Chinese celebrities') decision to post this when she has such a broad fanbase in the region. Her own groupmate, Amber, is Taiwanese-American. 

I do not expect many on this subreddit to be informed on the issue (though I welcome discussion on the matter). I suppose I post this because it raises a broader issue of Kpop idols and their involvement in politics. When celebrities take action that fans approve of, such as SHINee Jonghyun's support of LGBT rights or expressing disappointment over the Korean government's decisions on education or the treatment of comfort women, they are met with praise for using their celebrity to take positive action. But what about when their voice is not as agreeable, for instance Super Junior Siwon's tweet regarding Kim Davis? Then there are often calls for celebrities to stay out of politics. 

I wanted to open to floor to any thoughts on the matter (which I hope can be done politely and respectfully) ",205,210

For this, we are going to assume the situation is as a first pitch entails: Batter with no count, no runners on. Therefore balks are not enforced (this gets important for some pitchers).

Obviously this list is not all inclusive. I have to save material for offseason :\^)

**Yuna Kim** - *Samsung Lions* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/CheeryScentedLadybird)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ZU2XWEtEQ)]

Lions have called her up once again. After a shoddy performance last year at Game 5 of the Korean Series, management feels she deserved another chance. Little change to her form, still looking like a infielder throw, she's not even able to muscle it over the plate. Lucky for her the batter is distracted and swings anyways for a **Strike 1**. Points for wearing hat and jersey, though.

Grade: *D-*

**Mobile App Mascots** - *App store* -&gt; *Wyverns* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/WarmWavyAfricangoldencat)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8naw6VaOdQg)]

Honestly, watch the video on this one. 

I'm just gonna say it straight, this whole thing is highly illegal. Pitch doesn't count and I would imagine the umpires are wondering how they even let this happen in the first place. Uniforms are cool, but I don't think a short skirt should be worn on the mound (or should it? (   ) ).

Grade: *Z*

**Jeonghwa Kim** - *Gym* -&gt; *Wyverns* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/MinorCarefulGermanshepherd)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaD6NRrpZOY)]

Half windup from the rubber, into a rocket of a fastball. Low and inside for a **Ball 1**. Form looks solid, and she sure can huck that ball. A little more control and she might be a decent pick up for the Wyverns. Hat, glove, jersey, half shirt, and even pants with belt and cleats! This girl certainly dresses the part.

Grade: *B*

**Jeongyeon Yoo** - *Twice* -&gt; *LG Twins* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/BogusAbsoluteCockatoo)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY7hHs2Cz1I)]

Another half wind up. Eephus pitch goes high, but also drops well short of the plate, but the batter isn't too great either and swings for a **Strike 1**. Not sure what the Twins are thinking with this pick up. At least she's got a hat and glove.

Grade: *D-*

**Nahyun Kim** - *Sonamoo* -&gt; *Doosan Bears* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/PlasticSadIchidna)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1weNSDmZ9ts)]

Yet another idol acquisition for the Bears. Can't complain, it seems to be working for them as they lead the KBO. Again, half windup from the mound, but with some Cueto-esque misdirection on the leg kick. Seems to work for her as the batter swings at an eye level pitch for **Strike 1**. Glad to see more girls coming in with the full uniform.

Grade: *C*

Doosan seems to have money to spend this year. Boa is a much needed southpaw, as the Bears have been stocking up on right handed pitchers. She even features a rare 3/4 windup motion, albeit starting halfway to the plate. Ball seems to go a tad outside, but the batter waves at it anyways for **Strike 1**. Hat, glove, and jersey. Not so sure about those jeans though.

Grade: *C*

**Solji Heo** - *EXID* -&gt; *Nexen Heroes* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/HandyUnderstatedGermanspitz)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0lnP17dtJ8)]

One of the few Heroes pickups this season. Solji is another 3/4 windup pitcher, with a front of the mound handicap. Even then, that doesn't seem to help, as her pitch goes wild and into the left batters box. Luckily for her, the batter swung anyways due to his helmet obscuring his vision. Jeans seem to be a trend again this season, as Solji's kit is near complete except for her choice in pants.

Grade: *D-*

**Jisoo Seo** - *Lovelyz* -&gt; *Doosan Bears* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/SpitefulMarriedEyra)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Qg5mUNoP8)]

Front of mound, half windup. Comes in high, but the batter swings expecting it top drop into the zone. **Strike 1**. I'm not so sure about this one. Her form is shaky, even when compared to other pitchers of her caliber. I think the Bears will need to spend some time training her before she's ready to join the squad. I'm almost ready to say these girls will need more than hat, jersey, and glove to get any extra points from me.

Grade: *D+*

**Solbin Ahn** - *Laboum* -&gt; *Doosan Bears* 

[[GFYCAT](https://gfycat.com/OrderlyBothGalapagosdove)] [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI2zcHGGQ3E)]

The Bears hiring streak continues with this full windup right hander. Solbin's form is solid, and she's able to pitch around her batter, drawing a **Strike 1** with a ball right outside the zone. No chance of making contact with that one! Shorts may be comfy and easy to wear, but I'm not sure they'd be conducive to diving plays.

Grade: *A-*

One of the groups under pressure from Chinese netizens is SNSD.

http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=016&amp;aid=0001082714

This was after South Korea decided to host US's THAAD missile defence system in South Korea which China angrily opposes, as well as the international judge ruling that went against China's claims to the South China Sea as entirely China's territory.   Now China is mad as hell, and they are making Koreans to choose sides and face mass boycotts if they choose the wrong sides.  What to do for Korean entertainers who are active both in South Korea and China? Should they be cowed into submission? What do you think about all this?

Meanwhile, in South Korea, many South Koreans are unhappy about what the Chinese members of the Kpop groups have done tweeting SNS messages supporting China.  In a deluge of angry responses and criticisms, angry Korean netizens are telling the Chinese girl members like Victoria and Fei who tweeted their Pro-China messages, to ""go back home to China!""

I don't know why I'm posting this besides to express disappointment. I have a hard time believing bambam does not know the significance behind word and there is no reason a fellow member couldn't tell him its not okay to say it. 

edit: If he really did not know its meaning I guess he thinks its okay because mark's friends throw the word around like its nothing

&gt; Hello, this is Makestar.
&gt; 
&gt; We have an announcement for the honorary producers to the RaNia project.
&gt; Despite making numerous requests to DR Music concerning information regarding the project progress, Makestar has not received any further information.
&gt; 
&gt; The opening, and closing of Makestar projects are by rule determined solely by the project's creator.
&gt; 
&gt; However, due to the continued irresponsible behavior and stance taken by the RaNia project creator, and our unwillingness to ignore the inconvenience this is causing to the project participants, Makestar has decided to refund all funds accrued through the project.
&gt; 
&gt; We would like to thank the Star Makers who have waited thus far for news on the RaNia project, and we offer our regret in the outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; For those wishing for a refund, please send your request to:
&gt; help_en@makestar.co
&gt; 
&gt; When you send us your request, please include the following information for quicker processing.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Your pledge number
&gt; 2. Name
&gt; 3. E-mail (the one used to sign up at Makestar)
&gt; 4. Method of payment / Card Company

&gt; Thank you.

However, Naver Music, Soribada, Bugs, etc. etc., seem to have it. So I'm willing to take the plunge. I downloaded the Naver Music App, Mnet, Soribada. So far it seems like Naver Music is the only legit option.

Does anyone here have experience using either? The iOS Naver Music has a payment page that accepts payment in USD (but the terms and conditions at the bottom of the page state that Naver Music is for use in Korea only). Does it work in the USA? How's do the two plans (streaming or streaming+download for offline listening) compare?

**What is a demo?** 

A demo is the original version of a song as composed by the people involved in the making of the song. It's basically a sketch of what the song should sound like, then the company's artist will record their own vocals for it. They can be altered or left unedited. Demos are sold to or bought by record labels, producers, and artists for the purpose of releasing it as their own.",117,394

1264,2016-7-15,2016,7,15,1,4su8ce,[Discussion] Separation of K-Pop and State,AGentileschi,1468514663,"In American politics, a common debate is that of the role of religion in politics. Clergy are often frowned upon for expressing political sentiments. 

Though not quite the same situation, there has been longstanding controversy over the role politics should play in K-Pop and vice versa. A few examples:

* [Park Bom Scandal](http://www.allkpop.com/buzz/2014/06/was-park-boms-drug-smuggling-news-released-to-divert-attention-from-the-investigation-into-sewol-tragedy)
* [Tzuyu Scandal](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/414gwa/tzuyu_scandal_megathread/)
* [South China Sea Controversy (Current)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4sid0c/discussion_fx_victoria_posts_controversial_image/)

With fans demanding that their idols comment on political issues like the current controversy over the South China Sea ""decision"" and with Chinese idols being attacked for their positions ([see Zhoumi's most recent music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnyC4wu0dLw))...

* What are some other incidents you can think of where K-Pop and politics became heavily intertwined?
* What are your thoughts on idols taking a stance on political issues? 

This is not meant to be a thread to disagree over individual stances on political issues, please remain civil. ",21,14

- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

The fact that they have to announce that they're dating, hide that they are, and some even having dating clauses in their contracts etc.

Considering the new gen idols have been pouring out lately, what do you think companies should or shouldn't do with this topic for their up and coming idols?

I need to sell a ticket to an EXO concert (really good ticket, standing area 4 rows from the stage) but I'm in Korea for a short amount of time and don't know any super fans willing to pay 390,000won for it. Do you guys know any online fanboards for EXO or any Korean sites I could use to sell the ticket? I had a friend post a listing on  (TicketBay) but it would be much easier to sell it to someone--especially since these sites take 10%

1678,2016-7-20,2016,7,20,5,4tnbv9,Why do you think Boys24 isn't doing as well as Produce 101?,youcuteiguess,1468960269,"I'm a huge boys24 fan but I realized that many people don't watch it... It's been getting pretty low ratings and many people just seem to be fairly uninterested in it. Why do you think this is the case?

Personally, I didn't really like Produce 101's format just because it set up the prettiest/most popular girls to become Top 11. Many of the girls weren't that talented and it was just a popularity contest. It was also pretty unfair with girls who had already debuted/gotten exposure compared to trainees that have never been seen before. There were plenty of people who were much more talented than the Top 11 that got kicked off earlier in the show, as well as Mnet's editing basically setting up the final line up... I feel like the boys in Boys24 are extremely talented, much more than the girls from P101... Plus they're all basically no-namers with no previous exposure (besides like 2 or 3 who were on dancing9) so everything seems much more fair. But this is just my opinion... Feel free to share your opinions but please be nice and respectful towards one another (and me too hehe).

Quick Edit: I am aware that this isn't a male version of P101 but a completely different show but they have the same concepts which is why I was confused as to why it didn't garner as much attention. But yes, I'm aware of the fact that there's going to be a season 2 of produce 101 featuring boys but that this is not it.",56,13

Some shows I'm not planning on watching or don't mind being spoiled so I'm okay uncovering the text, but when there are shows out that I don't want to be spoiled for - it's like playing russian roulette lol. 

If we were able to somehow leave which show the spoiler is for visible in the title, I think it'd be simple for people to see if the spoiler is for them or not.

While we wait for an English article here's a brief summary:

* Luhan and Kris's original contracts with SM Entertainment are to remain valid. Their contracts don't expire until 2022. 
* This means SM Entertainment will not only retain their management rights in Korea and Japan, but will also be entitled to a share of the revenues Kris and Luhan make in China and everywhere else.
* They are not returning to EXO.

Sounds like a victory for SM. I believe this is just one of many lawsuits Luhan and Kris have filed against SM though (and the judges in China might see things very differently), so this isn't exactly over yet.",88,236

I need a random play dance mp3!,dunechka,1469174479,"I'm sorry for being annoying; in a perfect world, this would belong in /r/kpopslumberparty only, but it's not a perfect world and nobody sees anything posted there because nobody is subscribed ^*womp ^womp*. This is my favorite subreddit on the reddit machine and I'm hoping I can scrounge up a friend here.

My kpop friend, my kpopiest of bros, the [your favorite #1] to the [your favorite #2] and I get to go to KCON together this year. We are super thrilled etc, it is going to be a blast.com/partytime.

We both come from dance backgrounds and were originally drawn to kpop as dance appreciators. We're clearly both rabid fans by now, but the ~urge to groove (obsessively learn choreo)~ is still there.

It was cheaper for us to fly in a day early from our separate locations, so we have an entire night free. More than anything, what we want to do is test ourselves against the choreography we've been geeking out over and then poorly copying for years. Basically we want to get sloshed and do random play dance in our hotel room cause like fuk it u only kcon once maan

The issue is that if either of US makes the playlist, it's a bit spoiled for the maker as they have had time to prepare/know what's coming etc. Our hope is that one of you kind souls would be willing to put together an mp3 (are we on mp4s now? mp8s?? technology??) compilation of the famous audio clips of all the famous choreographies out there for us to dance to. More or less: a compilation of the songs that show up on a girl/boy group cover dance clip in weekly idol, suuuuuper famous songs that don't, pretty much any hit song in the last three years' or so memorable choreo, and fun surprises. My bud is all about the boy groups and I am a girl group person, so it could be varied and fun!!

I know this is actual work, and I am 100% willing to pay you. We're both (terrible) comedians and (AWFUL) dancers and are probably going to film this nightmare for posterity (*don't you ever listen to kpop*, children, listen to granny dunechka *she knows what it does to you*) but like if any kind soul is actually willing to put together this imaginary playlist (~50 clips of songs with roughly 10 seconds in between? *^^or ^^longer ^^we ^^can ^^go ^^forever*) not only will we give you shout outs and genuflections in our unwatchable video I am also willing to negotiate some billz and I will upvote and verbally agree with anything you post here in the future for forever, so hit me up. I don't know if directly offering to pay money for a silly service like this is breaking the rules of the sub, so until that is either confirmed or denied just ~catch my drift~.

2038,2016-7-24,2016,7,24,1,4u8xwj,Mini fan-account from Superstar JYPNation Cheer Up Event,OH_mes,1469292085,"http://imgur.com/a/bq66J

Pretty small and simple fan account.

6pm start time, so arrive at 530. 

Did a small count, 100 people were invited (Top 100 scores on Cheer Up) - 8 Females, 92 Males

You enter the small venue by ranking order, so I ended up around the middle (#48). Still good.

Lots of giveaways, signed albums, signed polaroids...

I got one of the albums but I already packed it away since I'm moving to a different Airbnb tomorrow. Yay

The top 10 scorers got to play on-stage, a random Twice song. All cards are 99* R's (jealous).

This is what bothered me the most. **8 out of the top 10 used money to buy their way to the top.** I wouldn't have this problem if they were good at the game, but 2 of them didn't finish their song (they failed), and the other 6 who bought in weren't able to 3 star the song (no misses). They weren't 1 miss plays either, it was many misses.

If I had known these people were that bad I fully would've committed to getting top 10. Sigh oh well.

Top 2 got to play on stage in front of Twice. I think #4 took first, and #1 took second. 

Then the Twice members come out to talk a bit, who plays the game the most in bed, who is really bad at the game, etc etc. 

Then Chaeyoung, Mina, Nayeon, and Jungyeon, the 4 who play the most and are good at it, compete to see who scores the highest. 

Mina wins, followed by Jungyeon.

Twice leaves, even more giveaways of albums and polaroids.

End of event.

Yay? Good way to kill 2 hours of time at least.

2108,2016-7-25,2016,7,25,1,4udxhj,That magical feel in K-pop I've wondered for years...,MostBasicOfAllBtchs,1469379539,"To specify what I mean by ""magical"" to those who are thinking K-pop is like any western pop music except with Korean vocals, I mean the ""vibe"". But what vibe? Is it in the instruments, mellow vocals, breathtaking visuals, or what?

Well, it's everything aforementioned for sure. But for me it's mostly been the chords/songwriting that's really made the difference. This is something I've realized just lately. Some K-pop tends to be more jazzy (jazz genre) nowadays in general. It seems like it's been a trend for a while now, to take influences from jazz, '90s pop music &amp; RnB, '90s disco and generally making music more ""soulful"" in a way.

Take a look at some of the post 2012 songs, such as [All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6UAEbsLEgQ), [Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px2Q47O0_eE), [Wifey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTkcMFu-81s), [You're the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro). Of course the instrumental and arrangement alone makes it even more soothing but it's all in the composing (for dat '90s soulful (RnB) (Disco) jazzy beat, heeell yeah!).

In my observation this jazzy theme has been even more true to Korean hip-hop songs even before this biggest mainstream trend every label is picking up on now. I believe that this truly is a thing in K-pop only, not so much in western pop music anymore.

Any thoughts on this? My apologies for bad grammar or generally poor explanation, had to explain myself before I lose the thought completely lol. I'm so hyped to say the least...

To finish off I'll just pop [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShzTqDHyIeU) here. Loving this song~ Holy sht.",15,0

Continuing /u/Selphade's playlists. I'm terrible with time! So three more playlists this week, and I'll see about transferring the rest for next week (or at least another three).  
For a small comment, it seems like both YG and SM has updated a lot of their artists spotify profiles to actually have real profile pictures, rather than just album covers. Looks really pretty! However, somehow [Bobby](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ieMQQDR0bdBPz572mtxwS) still has that weird group of people in blankets Another reason to look forward to his solo album!  
  
Also, I'm looking for a temporary substitute for two weeks since Im going on vacation! I'll still be here for next week, but it it sounds interesting to take care of this list the two first weeks of August, send me a pm! I will provide a list of my new music sources, as well access to update the August playlists on spotify! Otherwise, expect a huge post when I get back.",18,45

The second song would have never been recommended on any search if it wasn't for my knowledge of it. It got me thinking that /r/kpop would be perfect for kpop listeners to come together and make a playlist of similar sounding songs, with each ""Project"" being a new theme. 

If this isn't well received, I'll probably just stop at this thread. But if people are interested in something like this, I'll continue (I have a system in mind).

Anyways, these are the two songs I was listening to:

1. [Jonghyun - Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8iB877oXjM)

2. [Changmin - Heaven's Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQ6rnm_7wE)

I'd love to listen to your suggestions of similar songs to these. It doesn't necessarily have to be Korean, but it's preferred. The importance is on the sameness of sounds. Feel free to leave more than one suggestion :)

I'll make a youtube playlist after the thread starts dying down, if it even picks up in the first place lol.",4,17

Doesn't have to be something that makes lot of people uncomfortable, could be just a personal thing.

* BTS have become insanely popular

* BAP have really lost alot of the momentum they gathered back when they first debuted. I expected them to be big by now, but i dont really hear much about them or see many stans of them around anymore. Same for B2st

* Apink, Girls Day and EXID are popular (lol not that i dislike them or anything I love them all its just that before it felt like no one could give two shits) 

* There is a significant shift in interest to the newer generation of kpop grps (seventeen, twice, gfriend, mamamoo etc.), like people are more willing to move on from older gen groups and less resistant to the idea of these groups disbanding. I get this is probably the natural order of kpop...but still it feels weird that my little sis knows nothing about DBSK, T-ara etc.

anything in particular that's stood out to you guys? ",74,90

2249,2016-7-26,2016,7,26,9,4ulxlp,"Have there been any kpop groups you didn't expect much of that ended up surpassing your expectations completely after a while? And vice versa, any that captivated you initially but have since failed to reach your expectations?",rosealize,1469493960,"I feel like I'm always genuinely impressed when a group manages to break pass my expectations of them, especially since if I don't like a song or group concept immediately if very rarely, if ever, grows on me. Likewise, there have been groups that I've thought have had amazing concepts but have since let them go and thus failed to reach my expectation. Note this has nothing to do with reaching peak popularity or falling from it. But rather simply how you felt and what you were thinking/hoping for.

The group that managed to vastly impress me despite my initial opinion would most likely be Red Velvet.

I'm not a huge fan as I don't even know their names now, but when I initially saw their debut teaser it kind of put me off as I thought SM was debuting a generic, cute girl group. But upon the song being released, while I initially wasn't very attracted, it actually grew on me after some time. It's wacky, in an Orange Caramel type way, and I think that's a nice take on the cutesy concepts attempted by companies. Dumb Dumb only solidified that in my opinion. I would love for them to stick with the wacky, unique music. Their attempts at ballads and sexy songs have been decent as they have great vocals, I just feel like as a group, nothing quite beats the concepts they have in Dumb Dumb, ICC, and Happiness!

And the group that caught my attention initially only to fail to keep it is Nu'Est.

I think that back in their debut days, everyone thought that Nu'Est was bound to be the next best thing. They were essentially on par with BAP and EXO at the time, if not more popular due to the fact that Face was a big hit. I absolutely loved it too. It wasn't a grand attempt at being a hiphop group nor did it have any weird alien concepts haha. It was just catchy and the meaning behind the music video was great. As time went on, they had a few other songs that caught my eye here and there, such as Sleep Talking and Hello, but their most recent comeback felt like an attempt at being a cookie cutter boy group. Admittedly, I know they don't have much control over it, but I kind of miss the music they were putting out like Face. It was strong and uplifting. I hope they'll make a return to it!

What about you guys? What's your take on the question?",91,59

First of all, I love this sub-reddit and the people here :) however, I still would consider myself  ""new"" to kpop (since I just got into it last year) but I am so grateful and happy that I got into this awesome kind of music (I got started with SNSD's Gee -&gt; got seriously addicted to it -&gt; then got into many other groups like EXO, BTS, 4Minute :(...and many more) and I seriously love everything about it..kpop for me is more than music, it's also like one of the few things that motivates and makes me feel happy in my life right know.of course I knew that not everything in the kpop industry can be nice and happy all the time and that the kpop industry, just as any other entertainment industry has it's shady and not so nice sides: from treating idols like shit, unfair payments, no rests and never ending work up to ""slave contracts"".I know that those things are seen as rather ""normal"" in korea since those are kinda the risks of becoming an Idol, but just as I thought that those things aren't terrible enough I personally would have never thought that some companies would even go as far and sell their trainee's or artist's to ""sponsors"" for sexual advices with the goal for them to climb the fame ladder faster or to even debut in a group. I just found out about this a few hours ago and it seriously disgusted me so much that I couldn't even sleep this night.It just makes me feel so sad and leaves such an terrible taste in my mouth by thinking that the artists of my favorite or any kind of group were/or are still victims of this scheme. It just makes me feel bad for those who endure or might endured such things just to achieve their dreams and it really will not disappear from my mind when listening to kpop or just seeing or reading anything kpop related..I just needed to talk about this since it really bothers me and I definetely don't want this to be the reason to not listen to kpop anymore and feeling bad all the time because of it :( Maybe some of you feel or felt the same and could give me some advice how to handle this.Im sorry for any mistakes.

TLTR: Just found out about one of the most disgusting and shitty sides of the kpop or the whole entertainment industy as whole, which really makes me feel angry and disgusted.",14,0

However BTS' Boy in Luv always kills me inside. Love the rhythm and the song overall but that music video with the three boys fighting over the girl just makes me wanna say no no no (in APink voice).

Same with Got7's Hajima. LOVE the song but the MV is a big no (though it may be because of the hideous clothes and hairstyles of that era).

What about the rest of you? ",214,63

&gt;The lovely ladies of FIESTAR and the handsome guys of MADTOWN have become the exclusive models for underwear brand 'BYC'!

&gt;The two groups have also become the 1st idol groups named as models for 'BYC', and recently wrapped up their 1st shoot modeling various brand items.

&gt;For Mad Town, this gig is also their 1st ever modeling gig!

&gt;Yay for FIESTAR and MADTOWN!

I didn't want to only post a link because I don't get to have a body of text. Anyway, as I alluded to in the Free-for-All thread, I spent a week in Seoul and while there, I was curious and taking note of the music I was hearing. Because as a fan that has my own opinions on the girl group ladder and who's hot, I wanted to see what (or rather how) the data from Seoul would compare.

Here's the [full blog post](http://teryreviewskpop.blogspot.hk/2016/07/blog-kpop-in-seoul-ish.html) including my approach and some notes:

If you only want to see the data (on a very ghetto graph because I am a scrub), [click here.](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rGXtw9MZafs/V5hAEoumyuI/AAAAAAAABcQ/KE94gwhPtVQi0zL4AcaKDeGOpVeLv3RWACLcB/s1600/Kpop%2Bin%2BSeoul.png) But the full song breakdown is really bulky so you'll have to check the post for that.

But yeah! Get some discussion going, see if the data was anything like you expected or predicted. It certainly was a pleasant surprise for me.",10,33

Did the actual MV and song end up being as good as, even better than, or disappointing compared to the teaser?

I've seen a lot of teasers that really hyped me up for the MV but my favorite ones in recent memory are:

[Liar Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwSN4jx6JE) by Oh My Girl, which got me crazy excited with how good the beats sounded paired with that perfect timing in the editing and the entire aesthetic in general. The song was still REALLY good and one of my faves from OMG, but the teaser was so ideal that it had set my expectations just a tad higher.

In the [View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14polBWNsdA) teaser I loved that they used Odd Eye instead of View, it really set a mood that carried over into the actual MV despite it being considerably more upbeat.",95,68

2427,2016-7-28,2016,7,28,7,4uxe62,What song or artist have you had to listen to multiple times before you could really appreciate it/them?,brohammerhead,1469658789,"And what made you finally appreciate the song/artist? Sometimes K-Pop songs/groups will hit you like Cupid's arrow initially and others have to grow on you. These are the songs/artists that had to grow on me:

**Songs:**

* [Hate - 4minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_F9HUTYnl0): The change in tempo and weird horn turned me off at first but I loved the MV. I had to watch the MV a few more times to love the song. Now it's my favorite 4minute song (RIP).

* [Cypher 3 - BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjiHgd_iyKI): This song is one of the hardest hip-hop songs in their discography and I think that is why I couldn't get into it at first. It wasn't until I saw the boys perform this at KCON that I could fully appreciate the song. Witnessing their talent and passion in person convinced me to fall in love with this track.

* [Falling in Love - 2NE1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEVd9pSG85Q): It's not unusual for 2NE1 to experiment with reggae but this song was really reggae heavy. I don't hate reggae but it's not something I listen to often. I had to focus on the harmonies and the voices before I could love the beat.

**Artists:**

* [Crazy (Guilty Pleasure) - Jonghyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yIDkbbdOoE): I was very slow to appreciate SHINee. It was my friend's passion and dedication for the group that made me appreciate them. I gravitated towards Taemin because his solo stuff hit me hard. Because my friend is practically in love with Jonghyun, I wanted to give him a chance. Jonghyun has a very different sound from ""typical K-Pop"" so as soon as I stopped thinking of him as a K-Pop artist and just thought of him as a musician, I was able to appreciate Jjong. The MV for this song didn't hurt either. ;)

* [Nu Abo - f(x)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ZrPFMr_nY): I never listened to f(x) before but I wanted to get into them. I tried watching a few videos and couldn't get into f(x). When I was watching this MV, I saw a YouTube comment that suggested that the song sounds better with the tempo speed up. I tried it and that's what made me fall hard for this song. I can now appreciate the song at the original tempo and other f(x) songs.

* [1cm (Taller Than You - Mamamoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h41Rrk_6rzs): This is such a unique song and because of that I didn't like it or Mamamoo at first. I forced myself to listen to it a few more times and that's when I could understand the hype. I then explored their other hits like Piano Man, Mr. Ambiguous, Um Oh Ah Yeh and decided that I liked Mamamoo. When I saw them live at KCON I decided that I stan them. After the show I bought Melting and listened to the whole album on repeat. ",112,62

Well, I have a lot in my head and I really just need to rant right now. You guys don't have to read through this but lmao here goes. Well first off my name is Brandon (not saying last name cause I don't wanna) and I am an Vietnamese/Chinese American actor/model. I've done a lot of film and TV work as an actor and tons of modeling when I was younger. I've been on NBC's Grimm and was even front page model for the Amazon Kindle at some point. But as I began to age roles for asian boys tended to stick to younger kids and I was left with nothing to do. I am 15 now and I'd say the prime for my career was when I was 12/13. I look really young for my age so I guess that helped out. But as things started to slow down I began to felt a slight depression as I realized, things in America aren't meant for an asian person like me. Everything in America is meant for white people and I'm not going to cut it. After awhile I got over this and just kept on with my life. Eventually I was introduced to Kpop through family members and I was just so intrigued by the dancing and singing and how wonderful everyone looked. I just got a sudden deep passionate urge to be like them, like I found a solution to my depression from before! I just wanted to GO GO GO and be like them and move to Korea instantly. I knew that in Korea being Asian was the norm, that roles were meant for me and I wasn't the ""minority"". I just couldn't get my mind off of Kpop and being like them. I would be restless at night knowing that I wasn't a Kpop star. As my passion for Kpop and Korean Culture grew my viewpoints on life changed. I really didn't want to be the guy who followed the standard life path. Finish High School go to college then get a job and work for the rest of my life. That sounded boring and I wanted to do something I loved. American acting was great, but things started to die out... Korean Culture seemed to be the solution for all my problems. I saw all of my American acting as almost a training for what is about to come in Korea. I applied to a ton of Kpop Companies a couple days ago and I am sick to my stomach worried about getting in or not. I live in Seattle so Global Auditions never happen close to me, so I have to use the online email auditions. I am sick to my stomach worrying about if I got in or not because all my life I've been working for this one thing that I want to do so badly. And I don't know what to do if I don't get in or not. I don't know how long it takes before a representative responds but I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I'M SO WORRIED!!!! I mean I have a big history in entertainment and I'd say I'm handsome, coming that I get many compliments from people. I also have nice skin, but even with that I somewhat spammed the emails of Companies as my internet was killing itself so it said emails weren't sending so I kept hitting send to it sent to companies like 3-4 times each. I really don't know I'm so worried and I can't see my life without doing this.

2512,2016-7-29,2016,7,29,6,4v34gg,What's your opinion about Kpop lyrics?,stonymaknae,1469741656,"I'm asking this because the fact I don't understand Korean at all might actually be one of the reasons I love it so much, given that what could prevent me from liking a certain song is in fact its lyrics. If it's too dumb, or too ridiculous, it gives me a hard time to keep listening too it. Although sometimes, silly lyrics with a bubblegum pop is all we need to relax up a bit. And I understand that pop lyrics in general are dumb, even in the west, pop songs contain silly lyrics. The problem for me is when some songs are kinda... well... problematic. 

I've encountered some lyrics that rubs me the wrong way, for example some bits of the lyrics from Exo's Monster. Especially Chen's rap part. Another case is Twice Cheer Up; before looking for the lyrics, I thought the song was to just cheer up even if we have bad moments in life but no. It's actually a girl playing hard to get because she finds it fun to mess with the man's feelings.  SNSD'S I got a boy is another one. The fact the girls are changing how they look and behave because of a boy and even has parts like ""My prince, when you're gonna come and save me?"" are really offputting. Maybe because I'm not a teen anymore, I don't really dig this kinda of lyrics. 

What you guys think about Kpop lyrics? Have you ever found some lyrics offputting to you? Or even a kpop song lyrics that you find really good and inspiring? ",39,1

2574,2016-7-29,2016,7,29,23,4v6qtq,Unpretty Rapstar 3 - EP1 Discussion,CronoDroid,1469801400,"Since automod isn't doing it, I'm watching EP1 right now. I'll update. Anyone who wants tha stream, PM me.

So far it's Kassy by herself, now Giant Pink walks in. Okay Jeon Soyeon has arrived. I guess Mnet PIGGED HER. Aww, she still at high school. They're playing Fort Minor's Where'd You Go. WHERE DID FORT MINOR GO?? Damn she laughs just like a Korean, she actually went . Okay now Ha Jooyeon arrived. So sad. Melancholy music. She's talking about watching the UPRS2 finale and crapping out of SMTM5. Now she's looking for redemption or something. OH SHIT IT NADA. She looks kinda hard with that dark lipstick and eyeliner. Jessi 2.0? The other girls are commenting on her makeup, I think they scared. Soyeon knows she's from Wa$$up and she's having a bit of a giggle.

Janey turned up. DANG she grew up. I've been listening to K-pop for too long because I thought she was still a lil kid. Now I'm just a dirty old Chinese Restaurant. Everyone's saying she so pwetty. Hang on, I need to look up her age. Okay, born in 98. How old is that? Old enough. Uh yeah she is pretty, I guess she didn't get the memo about what this show was about (but then again neither did Kisum, Jimin, Yubin, Heize, Exy, Kasper, Jiyoon, Yezi and Soomin).

Ohh Miryo has arrived. Everyone is respectful, she says she's probably been in the game for 17 years, with Honey Family and of course Brown Eyed Girls. Damn she crying too. Come on woman. Okay next is Grace. Damn they're giving her a whole segment. GRAZY GRACE. She's cackling like Harley Quinn during her raps. Damn she just walks in with all this swagger laughing, smiling, joking and greeting everyone. Finally someone who isn't shy and awkward. 

Aww Euna Kim is seriously so cute. She looks like a little puppy getting thrown to tha wolves (or crazy dogs). She's actually collaborated with Tasha in the past, so she's accomplished literally everything Fraudy has wanted to do besides murdering the woman and taking her place. DAMN THIS STORY SAD. Since The Ark disbanded she's been working as a waitress? She's fucking sweeping up a cafe and everything. Wow. I've been there myself so I'm really sad now. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DISBAND A GOOD THING????????????? Euna and Soyeon greeted each other so nicely. 

LOL now Euna and Grace are talking to each other in English and the other girls are like ""WUT."" They're both from New York.

Jidam can't open the door so she's kicking it and shit. Okay maybe Nada is Jessi 3.0 because Jidam has become Jessi 2.0. Tiffany was lucky enough to escape her influence but Jidam wasn't so lucky. I'm just kidding. She still seems like a nice kid. Not that Jessi isn't nice but if I say something different she might find me and slap the shit outta me.

Euna is like NUGU? NUGU?? If Jidam is petty this will become a storyline later on in the show.

YDG is hosting this time. They traded one weird lecherous old man for another, but admittedly I kinda miss San E already. Oh it's pronounced KASEY, like Casey Jones from Ninja Turtles. I thought it was KASS-ee, Kass like ASS (fired). 

GIANTEU PINKEU. Damn her flow nice. Not sure if she made it up right there and then but the others seemed impressed. Jidam's verse sounded okay. Next was Euna and the other seemed impressed too. She made a reference to the past two seasons, saying something about Yezi, Tymee and such. Janey had a very short verse and stood up. Grace also had a really short, weird rhyme. Jooyeon did a short one too. Come on you can't just do two lines and leave it at that. Miryo next. People said she was good at freestyling and now people are covering they mouths. Thas how you know it good. 

Kassy messed up her first try but now she's throwing out a rapid fire verse. DAMN SHE MESSED UP AGAIN. Wamp wamp wamp...I'm cringing. AND IT WAS GOING SO WELL, THIS WAS LESS AWKWARD THAN THE PREVIOUS SEASONS. lul, Nada messed up too. Euna is looking towards the ground in sorrow. 

Soyeon is saying some shit now and some dramatic music is on. She was nice. She has this laid back yet energetic style. 

Uh, okay they're gonna do another freestyle of some sort? Soyeon put her hand up to go first and she picked Nada????? DISS RAPS IN THE FIRST EPISODE ALREADY?????????????????????????? Mnet are blowing their load faster than a /r/kpopfap subscriber watching a new Bambino performance. SOME DARK MUSIC NOW. THIS IS GETTING FIERCE. Nada just replied back with a little verse that is making everyone curl up and holler. 

I see how it is. Mnet trying to start drama early because there aren't any storylines coming into this season. Sad. Can we just let 'em live? 

Kassy chose Giant Pink. She was gripping her parachute pants tightly during that. Okay I guess it's over. They're moving onto the One Take Cypher MV mission now. We've already heard it if you watched their performance on SMTM5. I think some of them are questioning Kassy's appearance, she doesn't dress like a rapper. She looks more like a Western 90s singer songwriter or girl group member. I'm getting some All Saints vibes from her.

Primary is producing this first track, which was announced a while back. The director is the person behind Zico and Babylon's Boys and Girls and SNSD's You Think apparently. Wow Primary ain't wearing the box while addressing the participants. I guess that'd be kinda awkward. Euna just squealed hearing the drop for this song.

Okay I just realized Janey kinda looks like Kris, formerly of EXO. Moving on, they're giving Kassy the Yezi editing, making her look like a total airhead. Giant Pink is laughing her head off and mocking Nada's verse. And Nada is giving her a look that could chop down a forest. Jidam is also laughing at these verses. SHE THINK SHE GOOD NOW?????

I don't know if they're playing this up for the show or what but these girls are already shading each other. 

Janey and Soyeon are looking at Jidam like they're witnessing supernatural phenomena. They're stunned, and I'm not sure what's going on either. 

Alright after a bit of talking we're onto the filming. I think the director was asking who wanted to be in the fancy car (looks like a Lambo) and Jidam and a few others put their hands up. The director was like ""GROAN"" and picked Janey. Jidam seemed a little miffed. Girl really thinks she's all that all of a sudden. 

Jooyeon keeps messing up. KEOTEU KEOTEU KEOTEU! This is like the Korean version of Lost in Translation. She's this season's Gilme. Gotdamn she is bawling her eyes out. 

Jidam is acting like a diva with the makeup artists and Janey is not having it apparently. So many NGs for this. LOL now I see the logistics behind filming a one take MV. They literally have to run from one scene to another. This is hilarious. The director is getting pissed though because there are so many mistakes.

Grace is really something. She's dressed like an absolute maniac and it's working.

I'm liking the MV a lot better than the live perf on SMTM5. Kassy is wearing an AC/DC shirt though. Damn she's really not trying to act and dress like a stereotypical rapper at all. Giant Pink is really liking her own performance. She does sound good though, her tone and flow kinda remind me a bit of a female Flowsik.

How short is Soyeon though? Jidam looks like a foot taller than her.

People are picking and talking about Euna Kim for some reason. Did she mess up during the MV? She looks kinda sad. Okay they have to vote on who did the best and worst for the MV I guess? If this is anything like the previous two seasons.

Looks like YDG picked Jooyeon as the worst in the MV, probably because she messed up so many times. So did Euna. Aww shiet now Jooyeon is crying again. Unlike Fraudy this time I actually feel sorry for her.

Holy crap this fucking violin music. ENOUGH ALREADY WE GET IT, IT'S VERY SAD. This fucking violinist is warbling all over the place. 

OHHHHHHHH SHEEEEEEE-IT, Janey picked Jidam as the worst. This is Sua-Fraudy all over again. Young grill flaming the Mnet favorite. WAOW Jidam just laughed like the fucking Joker. This is getting out of control.

Giant Pink picked Kassy. Jooyeon also picked Kassy. Grace and Kassy picked Euna. It's two votes to Jooyeon, Euna and Kassy right now.

AND then Soyeon picked Euna. Dang.

Nada picked Kassy. And now so did Miryo. Kassy with 4 votes, Euna on 3. 

WHAT THE FUCK????? ADS? WHERE'S MY ADBLOCK AND UBLOCK??? Fucking South Korea, always trying to push commercialism on our asses.

Okay we back. Miryo picked Kassy. Welp. She looks like she got punched in the stomach.

And that's it. We done. This was about what I expected from the first episode for the new season. Tune in next week for another recap featuring even more memes and more trash talking.

Anyone who wants the torrent link, PM me, I'll send it to you once it's uploaded.

Here's the MV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkiWaPHdjuo

Holy fuck, they actually edited Kassy out of the MV. So whoever got the most ""WORST"" votes would get edited out? That's fucking cold, and shitty as fuck. Wow. I thought Fraudy was the lowest Mnet could go. This is lower than a mid 2000s Lil Jon song. Poor Kassy. The only question is, will she be the next Yezi or the next Lil Cham? ONLY TIME WILL TELL.",48,48

But Holicas (their fan club) seem to be taking this seriously, and it is going around the comments on their videos, as well as OneHallyu and I've seen a few posts elsewhere about it. 

Apparently Hwajung of D.HOLIC said at their comeback showcase that their company has no money, and that they set a target of 1500 copies for this album if they are going to fund another comeback. 

Some posts about it: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHh8G_ThGR3/), [OneHallyu](http://onehallyu.com/topic/357205-hwajung-of-dholic-said-if-they-dont-sell-1500-copies-with-this-comeback-they-will-disband-o-savedholic/), [Amino](http://aminoapps.com/page/k-pop/7824594/d-holic-talks-disbandment) (Disclaimer: Obviously not very reliable sources)

Their comeback showcase: [Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWweXcH92EA) (I can't find any videos of the full thing, or any talks where Hwajung could've said this)

If anybody has any more info, please let me know so I can update the post. Quite a few people have bought their album and started rewatching videos, voting on M!Countdown, etc. to avoid their disbandment, which has been heartwarming to see.",22,73

&gt; Snuper's Sebin sincerely apologized to sunbae artist Eric Nam for making a mistake during their performance on 'Music Bank'. 

&gt; On July 29, Sebin stood on stage as a rap feature for Eric Nam's new song ""Can't Help Myself"". Unfortunately, Sebin, being a rookie artist, forgot the majority of his lyrics due to his nerves.

&gt; After the show, Sebin apologized to Eric Nam with the words, *""I practiced hard, but I forgot the lyrics because I was so nervous. I apologize that I wasn't able to carry out a perfect performance as a professional should. On the other hand, I appreciate Eric Nam sunbaeim for being a professional and encouraging me.""*

&gt; Eric Nam showed full understanding and responded, *""I appreciate how you prepared a rap in a short time frame and decided to feature in my song.""*

Keep it clean. I know it's hot but let's not shade everyone okay?

In this thread, groups you like for whatever reason, but you don't like their music, and vice versa.

Inspiration: My sister **loves** Mamamoo as people, but isn't really a big fan of their music. Retro isn't her style.

Personally, I don't like EXO as people (oversaturation ahoy) but Lucky One is dope. Likewise, I don't know shit about Seventeen but Very Nice is pretty awesome. Conversely, I think Jackson is one of the best idols of our time, but I can't really get into GOT7's music.

2658,2016-7-31,2016,7,31,4,4vdo48,Rank the Performance of the Ladies of Unpretty Rapstar 3 Episode 1,Babyofakangaroo,1469908268,"Just want to see everyone's ranking on the girls in episode 1. This season is feeling a lot more interesting than last for me. Here is my ranking

01. Jeon Soyeon - her cadence and lyrical patterns are so colorful and definitely her own style. I came into this rooting for her but was blown away by her ready or not bars. 

02. Miryo - did what I expected but is really just ranked this high because she's Miryo. 

03. Giant Pink - Definitely a huge threat. She probably has the most authentic vibe out of all of them. Bitch came to win

04. Grace - I am a huge fan of grace overall but I was worried her skills wouldn't be up to par. Might not be the best rapper but she came in confident and I think her being American is giving her an edge. She's so much more comfortable with herself than the rest of them and knows who she is. 

05. Euna Kim - Regardless of her mv performance, I was really impressed. She has fight and is hungry for this. With so much on the line, I really see her stepping up as the episodes progress. 

06. Janey - She's the girl I knew the least about initially but with how young she is, I think she held her own. Still has to work hard, but I love her style and attitude. 

07. Nada - I have always really liked her and as much as she had some good stuff, I was disappointed. She can do better! 

08. Cassey - I really hope she can turn it around. I like that she's different. Doesn't seem too influenced by others and has a unique charm that I am enjoying. 

09. Baby J - that was all pretty sad. Her mind is not in the right place for this in my opinion. I've seen her live with Jewelry and she has something magnetic and special. But she just seems defeated already. Unlike Euna, I think her struggle will hurt her more than fuel her. 

10. Yuk Jidam - Honestly her attitude just turned me off. If her skills had noticeably improved I would understand it, but I'm not buying it right now. 

Really curious to see what others are thinking! So excited for this season and the next episode. ",9,5

So far, all variations I've tried have been pretty lackluster. The main idea is that you can create your own group from trainees you can scout yourself and give them singles, assign roles, debut or make a comeback with the desired mediaplay, etc. I've actually coded a bit already

I can make it really complex but everything I do ends up being pretty boring; it doesn't have the kpop feel (u know.. hype)

I know that myself, I'd just waste money on terrible groups with unfunny names and ironic comebacks (cus im hilarious) - but what would you imagine a game like this to be like? Has anyone ever thought of the same idea? Or how complex would you go in my case?

They were forcefully suppressed by approximately 1600 policemen",OwlsWithHats,1469970495,"Video of the singing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo3UMxYFNW0

Students wanted to talk with the president of the university over major changes that were enforced without even consulting students. The president promised to be there but instead they called the police to force them out.

Apparently they are also threatening to take away scholarships from international students taking part in protests. (Ewha Womans University one of the world's largest female educational institutes and one of the most prestigious universities in South Korea.)

This is more of a political issue but I thought I'd share it here since I would never have imagined that the song would be used in a situation like this.
