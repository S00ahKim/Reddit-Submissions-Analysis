Everyone thought that they were such as great couple and the two looked so sad when they had to say goodbye. Naeun is well known as an innocent and good-natured idol, and her perfect look captures the hearts and minds of men.
Red Light: Do you think 'We got married' is real? No, not at all. Check out this article. And so many male kpop idols are rolling their eyes at Naeun. 

Possible Candidate for Taemin's Girlfriend: 
Girls' Generation's Seohyun

reen Light: Taemin and Seohyun are in same company, SM entertainment. And as you can see in the case of EXO's Baekhyun and Girls' Generation's Taeyeon, there can be a special tie between people who are working in the same company. Both Taemin and Seohyun are the youngest members of their groups, and a bond of sympathy can be developed between them.
Red Light: Seohyun is 2 years older than Taemin, but it seems that Taemin doesn't like a woman who is older than him. 

Don't Forget to play the game below to figure out if you can be Taemin's girlfriend! :)

Can you be Taemin's Girlfriend?

It could be a place where we talk about present/past participants, where they get casted, if they debut under other companies and other news and of course where we could share the music they are doing and new episodes.

8:35

&gt;**Eric:** Jessi, I actually recently saw you on a new survival reality program, with some super unpretty, ""unpretty"" friends...

&gt;**Jessi:** Am I that unpretty?

&gt;**Jimin:** No, you are pretty!

&gt;**Eric:** Huh? No I'm saying that because the name is ""unpretty"" but it's not that fitting. You know what I'm saying.

&gt;**Jessi:** Yeah, no, the ""unpretty"" is a metaphor. ""Unpretty Rapstar"" pretty much refers to, like, you don't have to be pretty, and all that, you know, doll to be a rapper. And that's what it is. Yeah, it's pretty tough, man.

&gt;**Jimin:** But the point is, everyone's pretty over there.

&gt;**Jessi:** Um, not everyone, but everyone has their own charisma, unique style of rapping and looks. But I must say, this show is very tough.

&gt;**Eric:** What's the hardest part?

&gt;**Jessi:** They give us about 7 hours to write 32 bars.

&gt;**Eric:** Okay, which is a lot. For the people who don't know, that's quite a long... 32 bars.

&gt;**Jessi:** And plus on top of that, I'm not, like, really a rapper. I do it as a hobby. So it's harder for me. And plus I kind of, I'm not really fluent with Korean as well. So it's like 10 times harder for me than other people. So it's definitely hard but it's a really good experience. I get to show my characteristics. But what you guys see right now is just only a little glimpse of it. You're going to see good sides... You just need to stay tuned until the end, because it's going to get fun, it's like drama, you know happiness, crying, all that.

&gt;**Eric:** Have you cried yet?

&gt;**Jessi:** No. I don't cry.

30:30

&gt;**Fan question [paraphrased]:** Jessi, what goes through your mind as you're thinking of lyrics for a freestyle rap or just a rap in general or any song in general?

&gt;**Jessi:** Well, right now I'm doing a program called Unpretty Rapstar, as you know. Actually, nothing goes through my mind! I'm actually more of a vocalist. The show is actually really tough for me, because I'm still not really fluent the Korean language yet, so I'm still kind of trying, but pretty much nothing goes through my mind. I can't freestyle. I'm not a freestyler! And people don't know that, but I don't freestyle. I try. ... If I mess up, I just say something, anything.

35:00

&gt;**Fan question:** For Jessi, out of all competitors in Unpretty Rapstar, is there anyone you would like to collaborate with in the future?

&gt;**Jessi:** There is actually a few. Right now, I would say, uh, Cheetah. Cheetah, and also Yook Jidam. Those two are actually, I think that they're actually two of my biggest rivals in this game right now.",18,26

Well, IU's real personality is just like the dramas' characters'. She's cheerful and behaves in a pleasant manner. She's a bright and breezy girl. Her appearance? She looks like a doll in person. She has a small face, milky-white skin, and beautiful eyes. Her ideal man is someone who is not talkative but has a sense of humor. It seems that personality is more important than appearance to her.""

I wonder sometimes. There must be a reason for it, but surely a happier employee = better results, yet most are treated quite poorly. Saying that, such situations also lead to some epic concepts, so perhaps there's a theory behind it?",26,8

I'm Haeppy! I'm actually a YouTuber with BapMokja and we do a series called Smashed Reactions where we turn MV reactions into a drinking game, but that's not important right now (but do check them out if you want a good laugh hehe)

I'm working with a company called KPOP UNITED and we're doing promo Q&amp;A hangouts with San E (and potentially Ailee, still needs to be confirmed) for our UniteTheMic tour (Ailee, San E and Jay Park).

KPOP UNITED is basically trying to introduce a crowd-funded way to get concerts going in cities around the world which they've called Krowdpop(ping).
Basically, right now, the UniteTheMic tour will potentially be held in 6 different cities: New York, San Fran, Toronto, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Instanbul.
The way the program works is that each city has a 2000 ticket sales goal to reach. Once the sales goal is reached, the concert is a 100% go in that city.

We've already had 1 Q&amp;A session (with no stars) on ticket sales launch day that lated 6 hours where I MCed the whole time and it was a blast, so I think a 1 hour session with an actual star on the show would be great.

If you have any questions you want to ask San E, please leave a comment! If you have any questions for me, I'll be coming back to this post a lot over the next 2-3 days.

I'll try to get your questions to San E during the show, so please tune in as well!

tl;dr: Basically a non-live AMA for San-E. Will try to get questions to San-E on Feb 11 during my live Google Hangout with him. ",7,21

They lose weight through diet plus exercise. Most of them, especially female trainees, diet by eating only fruits and vegetables. They can't even dream of high-calorie foods such as chicken and pizza. It's really agonizing and psychologically destructive, but they have to endure it if they want to be famous kpop stars. Their efforts to lose weight are just beyond ordinary people's imagination. If they are disqualified because of their overweight, they fall behind in the competition. Actually, Kpop idols look much more skinny than their pictures. For example, Hyuna, who looks voluptuous on TV, is really skinny.(I think her legs are thinner than my arms) Since things on TV look bigger than in person, the idols have to be extremely skinny.

362,2015-2-10,2015,2,10,2,2vbfe1,"How SM, YG, and JYP treat their artists: SM's dramatic change",bluesea2327,1423502311,"""For SM, the most important thing is the company. Through its systematic Artist &amp; Repertoire system, SM produce idols of superior quality. The company exactly knows how it can maximize its artists' fascination. Just look at the EXO case. Some people criticize that the group has no personality, but it is an undeniable fact that the boy group is the most marketable kpop idol. By the way, SM's dramatic change is in the air these days. SHINee's Jonghyun, who released his first ever solo album in January 2015, took part in writing all the tracks of the album, while Amber also wrote or composed all the songs to be included in her upcoming solo album. Yeah, SM started to focus on its artists' personality, and the artists began to grow as singer-song writers.""

Some people think that SM uses its artists like slaves because there has been some controversy about the relationship between the company and its artists, including EXO's Kris and Luhan. However, as I mentioned earlier, the problems about long period of contract and distribution of profit exist in the world of Kpop, but it's not the problem just of SM. SM is now regarded as the agency that offers relatively advantageous terms to artists.
""For YG, the most important thing is its artists. Yang Hyun Suk, CEO of the company, tries to respect the artists' personality. As you can see in the cases of Big Bang or Winner, YG just waits until its artists are fully ready to release new album. Most of the YG artists write their own songs, and the company doesn't force them to rush. Some of YG fans may not like the company's this kind of style because YG's artists usually come back after a long hiatus. However, this way, YG can maintain quality of its artists' music.""


YG is a paradise for competent artists such as Big Bang's G-Dragon, Taeyang, 2NE1's CL, iKON's B.I and more. YG provides full support to them to make them use their abilities to the full. However, YG is cold and cruel to someone who is incompetent. They can't survive in YG.

I felt like doing this again too, because the random dance segment is so fun to watch when groups do it well. Here are (almost) all of them from the past couple years. Some are linked to the correct part in the broadcast, most are clips. Surprisingly didn't take too long to do this either. Enjoy!

For the uninitiated: Weekly Idol is a weekly show focusing on... idols. There's a segment on it called 'Random Dance Play' (or is it Play Dance?) where the groups will attempt to dance to their songs, formation and everything, as the producers jump around in the song. Can be fun, or can be painful, depending on the group.

Ive been lurking this sub and others for awhile now and Ive come to realize that there arent actually a lot of guides on how to K-Pop in Korea on Reddit.  Theres quite a bit of information on how to get into Weekly Music shows online, but a lot of it is outdated.  A little bit about myself: I am an active member of INSPIRIT and I currently live in Seoul.  I spend way too much time running in and out of broadcasting companies.

***

# Getting Started

As of February 2015, the currently weekly K-Pop recording schedule is as follows:

**Sunday:** SBS Inkigayo

**Monday:** Arirang Simply K-Pop (recorded every other week)

**Tuesday:** MTV The Show

**Wednesday:** MBC Show Champion

**Thursday:** Mnet M!Countdown

**Friday:** KBS Music Bank

**Saturday:** MBC Music Core

Programs begin recording during the early morning and shoot content until the live broadcast later on in the afternoon.  As a fan, this is important because there are two ways to get into a recording.  One is through a pre-recording while the other is through the live show.  Pre-recordings take place earlier in the day with an individual artist or group filming only their song.  This performance later gets edited into the live show, so a large majority of the artists arent actually performing live when you watch the show on TV.  Pre-recordings are a lot easier to get into than the live show, as getting into the live usually requires being a Korean citizen and applying online for tickets.  

The guide below will focus on how to attend a pre-recording for an individual artist.    
***

#Getting the Goods

The first thing you will need to decide is which group you would like to attend a prerecording for.  All artists have a list of things you are required to bring for entry.  Most artists also tier the order of entry based on how many of these things you come with or dont come with.

For example, Infinite H currently uses a two tiered system with items as follows:

1. INSPIRIT ID + Personal I.D. + Official Fanlight + Album [FLY AGAIN] + Proof of Purchase of the Digital Single [Pretty]
2. Album [FLY AGAIN] + Proof of Purchase of the Digital Single [Pretty]

On the day of the recording you will be ranked in tiers and given an appropriate entry number based on the things you show up with (ex. if a fanclub member shows up with everything but the light, they will be moved to the back of the fanclub line; if a non-fanclub member shows up without proof of purchase they will be moved to the back of the non-fanclub line, etc).  As foreigners who (probably) do not have fan club membership, it is important to bring as many things as possible or else you may get moved too far back and get cut from the recording.  

Slogan towels, if demanded, can be bought at the venue day of the recording.  However, some artists only sell these during their first two weeks of promotions, or until they sell out.  Proof of a digital purchase of the lead single off the album (  ) can be purchased off of any Korean music website (Mel0n, Mnet, etc).  You must print your user information along with your purchase history. 

Almost all artists (minus SM and YG Artists) list the goods required for entry on their [Daum Cafe](http://cafe.daum.net) (look for the words  to find recording information). For SM and YG Artists, their recording information can be found on the KOREAN VERSION of the artists official site.

***

#Applying to Pre-Records

Depending on the fanclub, pre-recording information can be released as early as a few days before, to as late as the night of the day before.  Most Korean fanclubs have moved to a Official List (run by the companies themselves), except SM fangroups, who still go by Fan Lists.  I will cover the Official List first and then the Fan List way.

##Official List Format

Most companies will post information on their official fancafes the day before, with information regarding the number of people they will accept, along with recording time ( ) and check-in time ( ).  You must be there by the check in time, or you will be moved to the back of the line.

In addition to this, the notices will also note the application time ( ) along with the number of people being accepted (~) and the information required for application. 

For example, in [this notice for Infinite H's](http://imgur.com/a/z6u8n) pre-recording for Mnet Countdown, the Recording Time is listed as 2PM, check in time at 12:30PM.  The required goods for entry are also noted along with the number of people being accepted (300), the application time (5PM-5:30PM, the day before), and information required for entry ( [fanclub members] Name / Birthday / Fanclub #   (non-fanclub members) Name / Birthday / Phone #).  

Around application time, a [separate board](http://i.imgur.com/YBDMRx6.png)
 will open for applications (I took this screenshot after the boards had closed, so there is only the returned applications board listed).  There are separate boards for fanclub members () and non-fanclub () members, you should apply accordingly, dont forget to **hit the lock key when you apply to make it private.**  Non-fanclub members are only accepted if there are spaces left after all the fanclub members have been processed.  

Later on in the day a notice will be posted on the fancafe with the full list of names for the recording, your number on the list is your entry number (some cafe also reply to applications with a comment instead of posting a separate list).

Please note that some clubs (such as BEAST and Big Bang), do not allow pre-applications/numbering for non-fanclub members.  For those clubs you just have to show up at the check in time and hope there are empty spaces.  

As a sidenote  YG singers use this format, but do application by email.  Check their official website for application information.  

##Fan Lists (SM Way)

Fan Lists for pre-recordings are, in essence, entry lists first put together by fans, which then are turned into the official company staff prior to recording.  The company then uses this list for official entry numbers. This used to be the preferred way of entry for most groups, until companies started prohibiting fanclubs from staying overnight and took over the lists themselves.

Nevertheless, SM still uses this method for all their groups (except for EXO, who have begun using the Official List format).  

As soon as notices are put up on the official website, a member of a large fansite will usually travel to the venue and post up a sign with recording information for that particular artist.  Thus, it is important as soon as you see the notice to travel to the venue ASAP and find the fansign.  

You will then have to take a picture with the sign and text it to the number written.  The person managing the sign will text back with your number and the check-in time (keep in mind this number is not final, numbers get shifted around when official fanstaff arrives and begins checking for goods). 

Depending on the artist, there can sometimes be multiple check-in times for groups before the official check-in time in the morning.  However, for others, the fan staff just require a morning check an hour or so before the official check in.   

*** 

# On the Day Of

Double check your check-in time and make sure you are on time.  

If you applied through the Official List method and are late to the check-in time, but in for the recording time, you will often times be let in but just moved to the back of the line (since you have a pre-confirmed number).  If you have a pre-confirmed number you do not need to show up early for check-in, just come a little before it starts.

If you are applying through the Fan List method and miss the check-in time you may not be able to get in.

The first thing to do is always find your group.  Look for fans holding your CD, or even better, the fan staff.  Fan staff usually wear tags around their neck with group names or pictures.

Fanstaff will begin checking goods/names as soon as the check-in time begins.  Have your goods out and ready as to not hold up the line.  As soon as you get a number youre good to go!  Usually the fanstaff lets people scatter and come back at a later time, make sure you pay attention to the return time and dont be late.  

If you are lucky enough to be in the front ~20 numbers, you will also have a good chance of getting into the live show in the afternoon.  Again, if your number is good enough pay attention to the staff when the pre-recording is over and they will tell you what time to return at for the live.

Also, if you dont get a number via online application dont worry! If youre determined to try to go its always worth it to just show up and ask.  There are always anywhere from 20-60 fans who dont show up to the recording day of.  Most clubs have penalty policies in affect to prevent fans from skipping out, but it still happens.

Keep in mind that usually 2/3 of a recording is waiting around, so please be patient.   Pre-Recordings, from check-in time to finish, usually last around 3-4 hours.  It really is amazing when you get to see it!

#[SBS Inkigayo](http://program.sbs.co.kr/builder/programMainList.do?pgm_id=00000010182)
**Time:**  Sunday, 1:15PM

**Location:** SBS   (SBS Dongchon-dong, Broadcasting Hall)

**How to Get There:**  Take the Metro Line No. 9 to Gayang Station (), exit out of Exit 10 and go straight two blocks.  

Inkigayo along with Music Core usually take the most amount of people for prerecordings (300-400).  Pre-recordings are usually held in a large hall with the first ~100 front-numbered fans getting to stand in front of the stage, and the rest sitting in seats in the auditorium.  Although Inkigayo and Music Core accepts the most amount of people, they are also the shows that get the most amount of applications due to the weekend slot.

#[Arirang Simply K-Pop](http://arirang.co.kr/Tv2/Tv_PlusHomepage_Full.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0636&amp;MENU_CODE=101505&amp;code=Po1&amp;sys_lang=Eng)
**Recording Time:** Every Other Monday, All Day

**Location:**  Arirang Tower (Arirang Tower 2351 Nambusunhawn-ro (Seocho-dong), Seocho-gu, Seoul)

**How to Get There:** Take the Metro Line No. 3 to Nambu Bus Terminal () and exit out of Exit 5.  Walk until you reach a large 4-way intersection (Seocho 3-Dong Intersection) turn left and walk until you are in front of the Seoul Arts Center, take a right in front of the Seoul Arts Center and walk down ~two blocks until you are in front of Arirang Tower.  The walk takes around ten minutes.

Arirang is the easiest K-Pop show for foreigners to get tickets to, and the smallest recording venue (you are literally sitting on the floor).  I highly recommend applying if you happen to be in town when a recording is happening.

To apply visit their [ticket board](http://arirang.co.kr/Tv2/Tv_MessageBoard.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0636&amp;MENU_CODE=101511), they will post information regarding their pre-recording artists and their main recording artists.  Read through and determine which artist you would like to see.

In order to apply for a slot you need to create an Arirang account and post on the message board.  The topic of your post should be the date of the recording followed by the part you are requesting attendance for (Part 1, 2 or 3) or the main recording.  You can apply for multiple parts.  You should write down your name, email, and phone number and make sure the post is marked as closed.""

Chosen audience members are contacted via email Sunday evening.  Arirang usually puts up the announcements for recordings around Wednesday/Thursday the week before.  

Please keep in mind their main recording is extremely long, as they film two weeks worth of material. If you choose to go for the main recording you will be in the studio from around 6pm to 11pm.

#[MTV The Show](http://www.mtv.co.kr/shows/the-show/)

**Time:** Tuesday, 6PM

**Location:**  SBS (Sangam-dong, SBS Prism Tower)

**How to Get There:**  Take Metro Line No. 6 or the Airport Express to Digital Media City come out of exit 9 and walk straight ~2 blocks.  SBS should be right on your left (along with a ton of other broadcasting companies).

The Show is one of the less popular K-Pop shows for some reason, so applications to get in are usually a bit easier.  If you dont have fanclub membership I definitely recommend trying for The Show.  They use an auditorium format like Inkigayo.

***
#[MBC Show Champion](http://www.mbcplus.com/program/champion/index.html)
**Time:** Wednesday, 6pm

**Location:**   (Ilsan, Dream Center)

**How to Get There:**  Show Chamption is the most annoying show to get to, based solely on the fact that it isnt located in Seoul, but in the neighboring city of Ilsan.  Personally, I find the easiest way to be taking the Gyeongeui Line (), a commuter line, to either Ilsan Station or Baekma Station and then taking a taxi to the Dream Center. However, there are buses that go directly.

Previously, Show Champion used to be unique in the fact that along with MNet it was the only show that had an all-standing audience.  However, as it seems the venue has changed since I last went, I believe its changed to an auditorium-based format as well.  

***
#[MNet M!Countdown](http://mwave.interest.me/mcountdown/main.m)
**Time:** Thursday, 7:30pm

**Location:** Sangam-dong, CJ E&amp;M Center

**How to Get There:** Take Metro Line No. 6 or the Airport Express to Digital Media City come out of exit 9 and walk straight ~2 blocks.  CJ E&amp;M is located behind SBS Prism Hall.  Walk around a little and you should find it.

MNet!  Mnet used to be the one show easy for foreigners to get into the live, however recently its gotten very difficult to get live tickets.  Although the show does still hand them out in the morning, Ive heard that lately they tend to only give out ~10 tickets per week for people who show up the morning of.  Still, if you want to try your luck show up *early* Thursday morning and try lining up for the live.  Early means first light!  

Besides that, MNet is one of the best shows to go for since its all standing so regardless of your entrance number youre always super close.  Highly recommend!

***
#[KBS Music Bank](http://www.kbs.co.kr/2tv/enter/musicbank/)
**Time:** Friday, 6:30PM

**Location:** KBS   (KBS Broadcasting Hall)

**How to Get There:** Take the Metro Line No. 9 to National Assembly Station () come out of exit 4 and walk straight, take a left at the end of the road 
(in front of the park) and walk a block down and take a right.  Youre need to look for the building in the KBS complex, its towards the back.

Music Bank is one of the harder shows to get into.  They are all sitting and have no standing seats and usually only take around a hundred fans.  Unless its a comeback or a goodbye stage (where they usually tend to take more) I would recommend trying another show. 

***
#[MBC Music Core](http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/ent/musiccore/index.html)
**Time:** Saturday, 3:15PM

**Location:**  MBC   (MBC, Sangam Broadcasting Station)

**How to Get there:** Take Metro Line No. 6 or the Airport Express to Digital Media City come out of exit 9 and walk straight ~2 blocks.  Pass SBS and cross the street to end up by the MBC Building, if you walk into the complex youll see that theres an indoor waiting room right next to the Starbucks.

Music Core also uses the auditorium style that Inkigayo uses.  They tend to record multiple artists at a time, so if you go in for a pre-recording you may get to see 2-3 other artists besides your own.

***
Thats it!  Please let me know if you have any additional questions or anything else~  I hope this guide can be helpful for others!  I think I hit the things that I had the most questions about when I first started visiting broadcasting shows.

I was asked to find out what it's like to be a male K-Pop fan. It's a serious question. Some of the responses I see were ones that I recognize from Tumblr and AKP where I did post this question this morning. AKP poofed my thread, then I was asked to post it here by someone who's working with me. So there's no ""link karma"" or whatever it is someone mentioned here. I actually don't use Reddit (I'm a fill-in for someone who does know Reddit stuff), but I'm just here for research purposes. ",70,3

AAB (Anam Bastards) is a hip hop crew that a couple of my friends have made in Seoul and we released our first mixtape!

Most of the lyrics are in Korean but there are some English verses.
We are trying to be different from the typical hip hop styles in Korea. 

If you want to know the instrumentals that we used I'd be happy to provide you with the name of the original name and artist. (since it's a mixtape all of the beats are from other artists)

Would really appreciate it if you would give it a listen!
Thanks :)

595,2015-2-14,2015,2,14,17,2vuww8,Chinese New Reports that Luhan and Kris Will Be Unable to Perform on Chinese New Year Eve Stage Because of SM's Recent Lawsuit Against Them,spicyonion,1423903380,"Original Video from Iqiyi:http://www.iqiyi.com/v_19rro23u8c.html(In Chinese)

The Video bascailly says that Luhan and Kris were schedueled to have a performance(Yes they were scheduled to be on stage together(!), originally) during Chinese New Year's Eve Stage for CCTV(which is the most popular Stage in China. However it was canceled/cut from the schedule

The reason behind this is the Lawsuit between SM and Luhan/Kris,so they cannot perform on stage somehow.(Since they did perform in China before, I guess this lawsuit is the one that SM recently put up against Luhan/Kris)

Edit: Grammar fix, English isnt my native language,sry about that

Just to give you guys an update on the status of the tour and ticket sales, Toronto is in the lead with 84% as of 9AM EST this morning, followed in second by San Francisco with 46%. Dallas has 20% sold, followed by New York with 15%, Las Vegas with 6%, and Istanbul in last place with 4%.

Toronto right now has the best shot of making this concert happen - so as fellow K-pop fans, let's band together and help bring this amazing lineup to as least one city. Remember, the show will NOT happen unless 100% of the ticket sale goal of 1000 tickets is reached by 9PM EST tomorrow night (February 17th). Let's support K-pop like always, whether you're from Toronto or not...support the movement and if you can, make the trip out to Toronto on March 20th!",4,1

When it comes to K-pop groups, do you prefer their Japanese released singles or their Korean released singles, or do you not mind both? And, if you severely dislike one or the other, why so?



To clarify, I do not mean a Korean single that was changed into Japanese lyrics. This talks specifically about Korean promotional singles and Japan promotional singles. Examples of this:

iNFINITE ""Be Mine"" versus INFINITE ""Dilemma""

SHINEE ""Lucifer"" versus SHINEE ""Boy Meets U""

SNSD ""MR MR"" versus SNSD ""Karma Butterfly""

BIGBANG ""Tonight"" versus BIGBANG ""Beautiful Hangover""



Of course, you do not need to directly compare songs. I just wanted to give direct examples to differentiate. I typically don't have a preference between Japanese singles and Korean singles, but if there's one I like more, I like SNSD Japan singles more than their Korean singles. To me, their Japanese songs are catchier but done in a much more relaxed way. ""Flower Power"" is my favorite SNSD song.",27,7

832,2015-2-21,2015,2,21,12,2wmf3b,CODE-V and Apeace are pulling the Japanese Hallyu,vlewitus,1424490045,"Original article is from [Top Star News] (http://article.topstarnews.net/detail.php?number=108209)

Here is my translation (there are probably a few slight errors since I translated it from a Japanese translation and I am not fluent in Japanese or Korean - I welcome any corrections in the wording)

&gt;As a result of examining the Ameba Blog Hallyu Ranking, a popularity ranking completely different than South Korea was discovered. The leading Japanese blogging platform Ameba services Hallyu Rankings daily. Looking at the rankings for today the 19th, A-pink, CODE-V, Apeace, Lee Junki, Supernovas Kwangsoo, No Minwoo (ICON), BEAST, ZE:A, Park Shinhye, and HIGH4 made up the top 10. Almost unknown in Korea, CODE-V and Apeace are especially noticeable.

&gt; Apeace debuted domestically in 2010 as a 21-member boy group. While in Japan, they have had more than 2,000 performances and have had a cumulative audience of over 330,000 people. Currently, their Naver profile has 20 members published, but the Apeace official Ameba page has 15 main faces listed.

&gt; CODE-V also debuted in 2010 and the Naver profile has 5 names published. However, it seems that there has been a change to 4 members. CODE-V, although little known in Korea, since their live in Japan Budokan in December 2013, they have been working successfully in Japan. Among the CODE-V members, Sangwoo, Nalaw, and Rui are enlisted in the military, so now it seems only 2 are remaining active.

&gt; Through intensive activities in Japan, CODE-V and Apeace have gained popularity and awareness. Supernova is another group not well-known in Korea and operating intensively in Japan.",9,6

First time posting here, just wanted some critiques on some mashups I made, and also I just wanted to share them. After seeing the other Mashup post, I figure I can give my shot at posting my own mashups and compile them all into one post rather than spam the New section. I am aware that key differences are abundant and I'm not afraid to say there are. I still think they sound good, for the most part.

Some agree and some don't agree. I thought it could be improved in a couple of different ways in order to more easily understand how close or far apart the groups are. Right now I'm taking a course in information visualization and I thought that it would be fun to make a visualization on this topic. The questions is what data should I use to create this visualization? Should I use digital sales, album sales, google results, number of awards? What are your thoughts? Thanks for the help!


EDIT: Since nobody seems to like the idea of rankings, is there anything else that would be interesting to visualize? I still think it would be fun to visualize anything with k-pop.",6,0

Her podcast is called Noonas' Generation. I know nothing about kpop but I support what she does as long as it makes her happy. I just wanted to introduce it to this subreddit. Any constructive feedback is welcomed and I'll rely them to her. :D

According to media outlet Sports Seoul, they were able to score a phone interview with Miss Choi (Kim Hyun Joong's ex-girlfriend)'s lawyer Sun Jong Moon. The lawyer stated over the phone, ""It's true that Miss Choi is pregnant. It's also true that Kim Hyun Joong is the father.""

""Miss Choi has been having a tough time with her pregnancy being revealed to the world; she is currently visiting clinics and getting rest and stability,"" the lawyer added.

The lawyer also said he has in possession plenty of evidence to confirm Miss Choi's pregnancy. Since Kim Hyun Joong's side had mentioned that they could not get in contact with Miss Choi at all when they had asked to confirm her pregnancy, it sounded as if she had been hiding out to conceal the truth. In regards to this, her lawyer commented, ""It is not true that she's hiding out. After she notified them of her pregnancy, she met with Kim Hyun Joong's side even until recently. She contacted them and met with them.""

    [Translation] Our MINE Did you have a good New Year and sweet weekend?
    This is my first time leaving a letter for MINEs
    
    
    Im very grateful towards our MINEs who continued to like us, and whose care for us never ceased although this comeback really took so long..
    I wanted to offer a present, and in my heart I wondered What should I do, what should I do!!
    Then I thought, If I record a song I like for you all to hear, wouldnt that be good?
    Its something I recorded privately in the midst of our promotions..
    You dont know how much my heart fluttered after receiving permission from the company to record it
    MINEs, youre happy too right!!!!!!
    All of you except
    Those who recently had to say farewells Im sorry
    Kekeke
    Anyway, MINE~~~!
    From now on, too, give Nine Muses an infinite amount of love; give it give it all
    Then Ill come by with many more presents like this, got it??
    With the onset of spring, springtime weather is gradually coming
    But its still cold, so take care not to fall ill
    Be careful of yellow dust1 too!!
    Bye! MINE I love you",0,1

&gt; Comment: *Links maybe temporary and will replace/update once MBC uploads them on their own channel. Please note that MBCkpop youtube uploads selective performances and does not post all of the performances on its channel.*

&gt; ***Low chance of obtaining any decent YouTube uploads for these Music Core performances. I'll try and find any after I get home from work.***

&gt; *If I made any mistakes, feel free to point them out and I will promptly edit them.*",33,54
