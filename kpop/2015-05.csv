There are plenty of K-pop groups out there and most likely you don't like them all. When I say ""couldn't get into,"" I mean from a group highly praised by the fandom, but you just don't find them particularly impressive. It's a question of taste, most their songs are not your cup of tea, so you don't consider yourself their fan. But you couldn't help but enjoy one or two of their songs. What are those?

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=14)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",4,30

(w/ Free Shipping),MotoHD,1430705940,"So this is a really popular trend on Reddit but there's this website that does promotions often where you can create a custom mouse pad and get it shipped to you for only 99 cents. Here's how:

1. Go to [ArtsCow.com](http://www.artscow.com/?Ref=1837697) *Disclaimer: This is a referral link that supports me. If you don't want to use a referral link just go to http://www.artscow.com*
2. Create an account
3. Go to [this page](http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad) and click ""Large Mousepad"" and click ""Create It""
4. Create your mousepad. You can add images and text anywhere you want on the mousepad.
5. Add it to your cart. When you get to the checkout use the promo code **Z099MOUSEPAD6E8E4**. Your mousepad should now cost 99 cents and have free shipping! *Again, this promo code is my personal code and allows me to build up points on the site. However, anyone can get their own code to share, so feel free to post yours below! I have no problem sharing the love!*

These take a while to arrive (I think the one I ordered last year took about 2 weeks and the one I ordered last week hasn't arrived yet), but it's pretty much a free mousepad that you design so you can't really complain. I don't know if free shipping applies outside of the US. If not, really sorry to non US fans =/ Let me know if the code works properly and share your designs! [This](http://photo.tinhte.vn/store/2014/08/2556605_tumblr_n4q6iyQ7VA1rx9gd8o4_1280.jpg) is the design I used! :) 

Oh, also to get your own coupon code:

1. Go to the ""My Account"" page
2. Under ""Affiliate"", click the ""Refer a Friend"" link
3. Scroll down and click on the button that says ""Coupon Code""
4. Hit ""Apply"" next to your code for the mousepad. Your code will now be activated and you can share it! Feel free to post your own code in the comments! ",7,27

[+8,937, -175] Eric Nam did his solo song just like his duet  I also really liked Kahi's solo song, she has really good and surprising singing ability and tone. 
 
[+6,076, -166] Park Hak Ki's voice is really nice  
 
[+5,605, -149] Today's King was Park Hak Ki. Wow.
 
[+4,920, -168] You can see the skill and personality in those who were eliminated, that is the truth. Or else you have bad ears.. 
 
[+3,507, -139] Today's judges guessed really well. Show outstanding singing performances next week in round 2 and please knock off Gold Lacquer's mask!
 
[+990, -42] The current method benefits the singer at the back (Gold Lacquer) too much. The song that they sing is fresher in the minds of the judges. Even last week, the singer in the back won. Right now broadcasting methods stack up statistics and are all about winning rates which won't go far (??????). Instead they should allow the voters to use the remote to give the singer a score of 0-5 points based on how they sang, immediately after they finish singing. This can already be seen on television through rhythmic gymnastics or figure skating. Otherwise the following winners will just go through the same thing. (and lose to Gold Lacquer)
 
[+958, -91] Eric Nam's opponent can't sing like a normal female..
 
[+655, -33] The panel right now is too boring.. Please make Baek Ji Young a fixed judge.
 
[+665, -48] Kahi has hidden her singing behind her really good dancing, and is there anything Eric Nam can't do.. Hope both thrive!",4,5

Two hours later, we tried the LA tickets sale for the hell of it and by some astounding miracle, landed VIP+!

Lucky for you, Dallas area fans, my friend and I are now selling the two Verizon Theatre tickets on ebay! Follow the link for seating details and ticket proof. 

The auction ends May 14 at 10:14 PM PST. 

Let me know if you have any questions!

I recently built PandaChat, live chat for any subreddit. I know a lot of subreddits have their own IRC channel, groupme or something similar but I just wanted to make something simpler.

The url for kpop's live chat is https://pandachat.co/r/kpop

I used reddit for authentication meaning you can use your reddit username on pandachat but we won't have access to your password or other info.

The site is still in beta I just wanted you guys to try it out and give me feedback. I want to add support for showing images/videos directly in the chat when there is a youtube or image link in a chat message. I think that would be especially useful for this subreddit since it is mostly links to MVs and images

I am zazpowered in the chatroom. Join the room and let me know what you think!",4,5

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",6,19

Growing up - I lived and breathed rap/hip hop music because that is what my family - hell, my people, grew up listening to. It's the music that tells the struggles of African Americans and I feel like it's being mocked. This is a genre of music that has been cultivated over years and I feel like people just want to use it to make them look ""cool"". I want to be able to like it. I really do. I've tried to listen to so many different Korean rap artists and I've found it extremely hard to take seriously. They're always rapping about how they've struggled growing up in Korea, how much money they have (knowing damn well they probably paying back their companies money for promoting them to begin with), and pretty much mocking the style of clothing that usually worn by people who produce hip hop/rap music. They think throwing on some Tim's, a big gold chain (amongst other stunts I've seen), and putting the mic up really close to their mouths and saying something really fast in Korean is considered rap. 

Half of these ""rappers"" are management appointed. Like, ""Hey you can't sing very well but you look good and dance well so now you're a rapper."" Then they demand to be taken seriously as a rapper.

Then I see shows like ""Show Me The Money"" or ""Unpretty Rapstar"" which just make a mockery of rap/hip hop in general. Does anyone else feel a similar way?",15,0

You might know me for the quizzes I posted (Kpop intro, Leauge of Legends laugh game). I just got another idea, but I kinda need some feedback before I go crazy on it again.

Basically, the idea is to store songs in a database paired with tags that describe/are suggestive to the song. Like:

* Red Velvet - Happiness: upbeat, summer, debut, caribbean, girl, chant, bridge, etc
* Lim Kim - Love Game: claps, voice, horns, electronic, etc

Then people could **search for tags** (like ""upbeat girl group summer song with surprising bridge"") and the site would **suggest songs** they'd like (i.e. Red Velvet's Happiness).  

It's a great way to store **statistics**: what people are looking for, which songs are generally liked, which genres, etc (charts based on *unbiased* opinions (that is if the searches are genuine)). It's also easy to find new/undiscovered songs this way. People could add/edit songs with new tags.

What do you think? Something worth starting? It's just something that came across my mind.

EDIT: To everyone saying it'd take so long, it sure would. I'm definitely not planning on adding all songs myself and I'd love for the site to be community dependant/selfsufficient (in a way). Looks like so far, feedback has been great!",25,76

670,2015-5-15,2015,5,15,2,35yqlg,Looking to start a k-pop dance cover group in the Albany area!,[deleted],1431623180,"Hello /r/kpop! I'm looking to start a k-pop dance cover group in the Albany, NY area this summer. Basically I want to gather a group of at least 3 others to form a small group and take part in some dance covers for upload or help me create flashmobs or even just some random dancing around the city. I already know a lot of dance routines, but I'm also willing to learn and collaborate with you if know dances to other songs that you'd like to perform as a group.

Some facts about me: I'm a yuppie. I'm a 23 year old female. I just graduated from university and I will be working full-time immediately afterward in the Albany area. My favorite k-pop groups are SNSD, Crayon Pop Brown Eyed Girls, Ladies Code, Orange Caramel, f(x), EXO among many others. I've been dancing for almost 4 years and have taken courses in modern, tap &amp; African dance. I know a lot of dance routines for a lot of girl groups and I'm really eager to get out there and have fun with some other people (preferably, but not exclusively, girls).

Choreography I'm capable of teaching include:
SNSD: Mr Mr, I Got a Boy, Gee, Catch Me if You Can, Genie, Love &amp; Girls, Holler (TTS)
Orange Caramel: My Copycat, Catallena
Miss A: I Don't Need A Man, Only You
4minute: Whatcha Doin' Today, Crazy, Red (HyunA)
EXO: Growl
Red Velvet: Ice Cream Cake
EXID: Ah Yeah, Up &amp; Down
Crayon Pop: Bar Bar Bar, Uh EE, OK (Strawberry Milk)

What I would want from you: 18-30 age range is preferred. Some dancing experience would be great! It doesn't have to be professional. Dancing in your room (which is what I mainly do) totally counts! Ideally you would have some sort of financial support so we could coordinate outfits, &amp; rent a dance studio.

Anyway, feel free to message me if you're truly serious. I move to the area at the end of the month and would want to get started sometime late June early July when I'm fully settled.

Thank you in advance to anyone reading this!",3,13

673,2015-5-15,2015,5,15,4,35z5hw,"Do you prefer solo artists or groups, and why?",[deleted],1431630153,"I've always preferred K-Pop groups to solo singers and never really thought about why I did, until today when it all clicked.

Because of the way K-Pop culture divides members into singing, rapping, dancing, visual, etc., I've always seen group members with strengths and weaknesses, and I realized that I view these strengths and weaknesses in an almost video-game stats kind of way. So I've always pictured members of groups with little stat bars that, instead of saying Speed, Strength, Life, etc., would say Singing, Dancing, Rapping, etc. Being a huge fan of video games, this always made me prefer groups because I could pick a member with the ""stats"" I liked best, but could still enjoy the other members and their strengths (like playing with multiple characters in a game), where solo artists don't really give me that.

Probably a really weird analogy that might not make a lot of sense, but the way I see it has always given group members this essence of power and respect as well (being seen in a selectable fighters manner, it makes sense to me).


So what do you prefer, and why? I'd love to know if this is actually a bit more common of a thought or, more likely, if I just have a really weird way of viewing groups.",0,0

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",15,26

This post will be just my opinion on kpop, please try not to get offended because I'm asian too. But I live in the U.S. So this is just my prospective of kpop and how pretty much most of Americans see it. To be honest I don't even know if anyone will read this or if it'll be removed.


Alright, to start off the discussion, Plastic surgery! In Korea it's not called plastic surgery, it's called removal surgery because it sounds a bit nicer.
in my opinion they should really just stop doing it, because while Korea thinks it's okey and normal to do plastic surgery the rest of the earth thinks it's not. 
Where I live, which is in the U.S. People make fun of Asians for looking alike
(Koreans are considered Asians) if you compare other groups of people (like Americans or blacks) Asians DO LOOK ALOT ALIKE, and that's coming from an Asian. My point is, if there's 2 people who don't really look alike and they do plastic surgery then it usually results in them looking the same. Which in my opinion, why would you want todo that?
I'm sitting here watching kpop music videos and I literally can't tell them apart besides looking at their hair. I mean, you really have to think that your really  ugly to do plastic surgery multiple times.



All over the world men are known for being manly...



You look at these kpop stars and you see then wearing makeup, you see them saving their arm pit hair, and NONE of the kpop stars Iv seen even have mustaches or any kind of hair growing on their face. 


All those things make you more girl like than manly if you ask me.
In the U.S. Most people would consider kpop stars as Emo or Gay like because of the makeup and stuff. You can take a male kpop stars face, put a girl wig on it and go take a walk on the streets and most people will think your a girl.


That's all I have for now, please be respectful because this is just my prospective and how people in the U.S. Kinda see kpop as I don't mean to offend Koreans even though I kinda did, but just keep in mind that I'm Asian too, I'm chinese-American and this is just my opinion and I'm just trying to open up a discussion.",13,0

I probably won't make a new thread, but if you have any questions, you can ask almost anything.

I'll go to sleep now, I'll answer further questions in the morning.

Got some sleep, I'm up again and on the way to answer.

PROOF EDIT : My parents ( my mom) is home, and I asked about the papers. They signed the contract closing, and they sent it back last week and it arrives some time this week, a copy of my first contract page of 2013, and the legitimate renew cancel of last week. I'll make photos of that, blur out the confidential information and post them in a different thread because this thread will probably be buried soon as it's up 12 hours. 

EDIT : 2 : I talked with some people and I'm starting a YT channel soon, but I'll start off with a single vlog and show my proof on video so people can't tell me that I'm a fraud. I'll talk about everything on that video and after that I'll start doing some covers.

Thank you for all the kind words again, means much :) ",414,243

What kind of group gets named like this?' xD So I didn't do it for a couple of days--and my friend would ask if I had listen to it already, until I sat down with another friend and I told her about the small situation I was in(not really, but you know. ;P) and so we searched them on youtube and we clicked on 'Sexy, Free, and Single' I wasn't really impressed with what I saw at first, tbh. But then we clicked on 'Spy' and OMG! That song made it for me. ;3 And then I discovered 'Mr. Simple' and fell in love again. I love KPOP.

It looks like the other post got deleted (probably because it's OneHallyu?) so I'm resubmitting it. I can still access the post, but it doesn't show up on the new section.

&gt;A long time ago, Jessica stood in front of Marie Claires cameras for a photoshoot. Unlike before, when she would show up surrounded by a chaotic group of managers and staff, this time, she came to the studio all by herself. It was the day before her birthday, and fans who were close enough with her to just call her Sica also showed up with a bundle of cupcakes and drinks for Jessica and the magazine staff. She seems to have gained a bit of weight recently and has been busy preparing a new collection for her own fashion brand, Blanc &amp; Eclare.
 
&gt;This was her first interview after everything that went down, so she seemed more cautious with her answers, but you could tell by her gaze that she was now letting a lot of the past go and chasing a new dream.
 
&gt;There is going to be a denim line this season for Blanc &amp; Eclare. Denim is actually a very difficult field. I thought a lot about the perspective of the ones who will be wearing the product. I had to think about what specific length fits Asians better when designing the skinny denim pants. In Hong Kong and China, you can find Blanc &amp; Eclare products at the Lane Crawford stores. In Korea, we are opening up popup stores, and I think well soon start opening up actual stores in malls.
 
&gt;Jessica has gone through a lot of changes lately. And with these changes, she has been at the end of many harsh words. Rather than spending the time to confirm what was truth and what were misunderstandings, she quietly spent her time expanding her fashion line to new fields, and began to face a world away from the stage. To be honest, Im very nervous doing interviews. There are times articles get released of things I didnt mean, which leads to many misunderstandings. And its not like I can explain myself every single time that happens. When I look at the bigger picture, I think its better to be more picky with what you clear up than clearing everything up.
 
&gt;There are times when I feel like Im receiving all the hate in the world. It would be a lie if I said that it wasnt hard for me during those times. But I think my skins gotten thicker lately. I try a lot to become stronger. I kind of look a bit wicked. I think thats why people hate me more.
 
&gt;Everything is fascinating to me. The drawings I sketch come to life as products, and its really interesting to see those products in display at stores and then get purchased by people. But some people are under this misconception that I am the only one in charge of this brand. The truth is that to get one product completed, the members who make up my team all have to come together with their ideas. Im a bit embarrassed and burdened to hold the titles of representative and CEO. There are times when I also feel sorry that because my name, other peoples efforts get ignored.
 
&gt;The biggest strength for Jessica during her hard times has been her family. She recently went on vacation with her sister, mother, and father. It was the first time her entire family was able to go on vacation since her debut.
 
&gt;Things are a lot different now compared to how it was when I was with SNSD. I really enjoyed the time I spent with the other members, but now that Im by myself, I have a lot more time now. I am planning on going to school to seriously learn more about fashion design, but I havent decided on the exact timing for that yet. Im just actively studying on my own for now. I realized that no matter what I go through, a more comfortable time soon comes. Even if I go through something very difficult, as more time passes, the happier I become.
 
&gt;Shes also gotten a lot more freedom over her decisions. If I was still a SNSD member, I wouldnt have been able to do this shoot. Idol groups have to always be happy. They have to be kind, and pure, and bright. But Im already 27 years old. I cant forever remain a happy little girl. Someone might think after seeing these pictures, Now that shes out of SNSD, shes taking off her clothes. But Im not a little girl anymore. I think its okay for me to portray Jessica as a woman. Since I debuted when I was 19 years old, there are times all the restrictions and limitations can get irritating. Now, I can make all my own decisions. It wasnt so bad deciding to come to this photoshoot all by myself.
 
&gt;Jessica has decided to let go of all of her regrets in the past and all her frustrations of not being able to clear up the publics misunderstandings about her. Shes instead spending each day to build up and anticipate for the road ahead of her. She wants to formally learn about fashion, and she wants to put out music that captures her voices charms.
 
&gt;I have been thinking about myself a lot more lately. In a few years, Ill be 30, and there are times that makes me anxious. Im not sure why. But I think now, I have to live life for myself and not for anyone else. And now Im alone, so my flaws that the other members used to fill up for me, I have to fill them up myself now. I have to be able to approach people Ive met for the first time, and I have to try to make people feel more comfortable around me. I think when people see me, they think Im like a wall. Its hard for me to approach someone first if Im not close with them. So its hard for me when I have to attend events all by myself. I have to be able to approach someone first before they can feel that they can approach me. Im currently trying to tear that wall down.
 
&gt;Come to think of it, the Jessica we know is an ice princess. She isnt lively, she tends to hide away more. She also doesnt like beating around the bush, she prefers to tell it to you in a way thats easy to understand. So you can see how people can feel that shes like a wall, and how people may misunderstand her. Shes overcome a lot of obstacles, and now, shes focusing on the road ahead, and shes living the dreams shes had to push back all this time, and shes living a joyful life continuously dreaming new dreams.",67,235

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",4,8

1119,2015-5-24,2015,5,24,8,371f9j,Kcon East concern,[deleted],1432424211,"Like a lot of you, I have been waiting a long time for something like the upcoming Kcon to happen here in the eastern part of the US.  Jersey is pretty close to me and I'm pretty sure I will be able to afford tickets, so I can definitely go if I so choose.  

Here is my concern:  unlike most Kpop fans, I am a white guy in my early fifties.  I discovered Kpop almost four years ago after reading an article about the SMTownNYC show at Madison Square Garden.  I soon fell in love with the music and have listened it almost exclusively ever since.  

So I would like to hear what your reactions would be if you saw someone like me at something like this.  I'm a normal guy -  married, children, good job, decent dresser, average looking.  So at least I don't think I look creepy.  The only thing that would really set me apart would be my age.  If I go I just want to enjoy the music and the other stuff going on and not get stared at and/or ridiculed like I had three heads or something.  

So am I just being paranoid?  Has anyone been to something like this and seen anyone older there?  If so, what was your reaction?  Please be brutally honest.  I can take it.  

Edit: Thanks everyone.  Awesome responses.  I feel a lot better.  I guess I have to go find a good set of earplugs now!",58,78

1218,2015-5-27,2015,5,27,0,37c1xb,South Korean broadcaster carefully probing about possibilities of partaking in Eurovision Song Contest,qquestionmark,1432652403,"[Here is an article in Norwegian discussing the possibilities for Eurovision to include more non-European countries](http://www.nrk.no/mgp/esc-sjefen_-ikke-aktuelt-med-_worldvision_-1.12378066). The executive supervisor of the ESC (Jon Ola Sand) rejects this idea, claiming that Australia is the only country to officially ask for permission to partake in the ESC, but he also mentions that a Korean broadcaster has been carefully probing. Can't be bothered to translate the entire article, but I thought I would translate the relevant part for /r/kpop:  
  
&gt; Iflge Sand er Australia s langt det eneste landet utenfor den europeiske kringkastingsunionen EBU som har ytret nske om  delta. I tillegg har en srkoreansk kringkaster kommet med forsiktige sonderinger.
  
&gt; Australia is the only country outside of the European Broadcasting Union EBU who has declared a wish to participate, according to Sand. In addition, a South Korean broadcaster has been carefully probing.
  
It doesn't mention which company, but according to the [EBU wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union#Associate_members), KBS is an associate member of the EBU, so I assume it would be them. It makes sense to me that SK might be interested in participating in a competition like ESC as they are always eager to export their culture, and ESC is quite popular in Europe, but also shown in other countries. Not a fan of ESC personally, but I thought there might be some fans of ESC here, so I thought it might be relevant here since we might some day see some kpop in ESC. [ESC's wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest) for those not familiar with it.  
  
edit: Thought I might mention that the reason why this is suddenly being discussed is because for the first time ever, Australia participated in this years Eurovision. First ever country not even remotely close to Europe that has ever participated. Other non-European countries include Israel, Turkey, Azserbaijan and Morocco (once in 1980), but they are all members of EBU, while Australia only has assosciate membership of EBU.",83,65

My answer, and the inspiration for this thread: I LOVE LOVE LOVE listening to MR Removed videos of Sketchbook (They're the only ones that really 'count' anyway IMO), and I was listening to [Touch My Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFN3gHNBdCs).  Obviousy Hyorin slays but I scroll down to the comments and its ALL shitting on Dasom..but then listen to the video and realize the whole damn song Dasom is harmonizing with Soyou (unless Soyou can suddenly overtone idk...lemme know).  

Basically, kpop fans have NO appreciation for vocal technique and only circle jerk over big voices.  That's what I hate.

&gt; ^(***I may or may not be consistent with these `Show Champion` threads. I'll try my best to keep up. Using as many YouTube uploads instead of daum links for Show Champion specifically, granted I make these threads during the live broadcast. Please keep in mind that Show Champion is about a week late in up-to-date promotions. Think of the music show promotion cycle starts with M! Countdown-Thursday to Show Champion-Wednesday.***)

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",9,9

Does anyone have experience getting VIP tickets with k-pop concerts? I'll already be spending money to travel from Chicago, do you think it's worth it to just splurge on VIP tickets? Then again, maybe it's better to get guaranteed seats, rather than a mad dash when it's standing room only!

When revisiting the rough video K-Pop Hot Clip of Cupid, it's obvious the video was rough as it was all up close scenes rather than a combination of dance shots and the video's borders had not been layered teal as they are in the final.

However, I noticed there's also parts of the audio inconsistent with the official released one. The most noticable is Gyuri's backing vocals heard [here](https://youtu.be/74RzHIpZuDY?t=34s) are nonexistent in the preview [video](https://youtu.be/KUFGrP63I0Y?t=35s).

I would understand that this is the rough version of the song to work on the video, but with the K-Pop Hot Clip coming out a mere 3 days before the final release, how is it possible that the newer version was prepared ahead of time for CD pressings, album promotions, etc.? Considering the time it takes to properly add effects, equalize, and master a song, and how revisions would be necessary when adding backing tracks, it seems very hard to do.

This combined with the teasers having the more angelic sound to them while the final seeming very lacking instrumental-wise makes me feel as if this comeback was very rushed not only in terms of the video, but also in terms of actual sound (not to mention most songs were significantly lower quality compared to Day &amp; Night).

I apologize if this is too close to an album review and doesn't need a thread, but something about this KARA release has seemed really off and I'd love to hear if anyone else feels the same.",1,1

If I could name any one group that sold me on K-Pop it would be KARA.  Those mesmerizing hips are just... wow (fantastic baby).  My favorite K-Pop song of all time is Step, and I've watched that MV probably 50? 100? times.  Yet it was just 2 months ago that I was able to look behind the girls and notice that all of the buildings had signs with the names of KARA's best hits.


**1. 'STEP' - KARA** [Link](https://youtu.be/zYoYoBtLqOY?t=49s) *Look on the sides for Mr., Lupin, and Pretty Girl.*  

* **Bonus:** *Find Honey, Jumping, and one more [spoiler](/s ""Rock U"") [hover] (I think that's it?).*

Thus, the purpose of this post is simply to remind you that maybe once in a while it is OK to take your eyes off the idols and enjoy the work of the set designers.  Here are some other things I've caught while watching K-Pop.   

**2. 'I Don't Need a Man' - miss A** [Link](https://youtu.be/EkSOOiMDGiY?t=1m55s) *Find the names of the girls and of course JYP in the graffiti.*

* **Bonus:** *Start from the beginning and try to find the megaphones sitting in the rooms before the girls pick them up.*


**3. 'Comeback When You Hear This Song' - 2PM** [Link](https://youtu.be/a7cH5EAXNNg) *While 'hidden' these were clearly intended to be found.  Look for the 7 deadly sins (wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony).*

* **Bonus:** *What is the name of the building they are dancing in front of later in the MV?  I like to think it was a nod to their Japanese album earlier that year.*

**4. 'Mr. Chu' - Apink** [Link](https://youtu.be/K5H-GvnNz2Y) *What's the score of the tennis game?  What day does the calendar count down to? What day did Apink release Pink Blossom?*


**5. 'Loser' - BIGBANG** [Link](https://youtu.be/1CTced9CMMk?t=1m24s) *Lots of stuff going on in this MV, for starters the baseball bat.  But also all the positive messages around Taeyang (who then makes that depressing chalk cross).*

* **Bonus:** *There are two glimpses of G-Dragon's knuckles in the MV.  What is tattooed on them? [spoiler](/s ""I think it says 'self made'"") [hover]*

**6. 'You're So Fly' - BTOB** [Link](https://youtu.be/RQoOEEnKlVY) *Literally BTOB and Cube all over the place if you're looking for it (don't miss the can!).*

* **Bonus:** *Look out for song lyrics too! ('oh venus' for one)*

**7. 'We Don't Stop' - FIESTAR** [Link](https://youtu.be/gyu_ne_cmy8) *Right off the bat check out the hot air balloons.  Also the 'I LOEN U' sign.*

* **Bonus:** *This is the absolute best thing I've ever found hidden into a MV.  Hard to spot so I'll help you out, as the girls leave the room [HERE](https://youtu.be/gyu_ne_cmy8?t=1m41s), pause the video as portions of the room light up.  [spoiler](/s ""reveals the letters of FIESTAR"") [hover]*

At the end of the day, not every video has some special thing hidden in it.  In fact most of the time you probably wont find much.  But every once in a while, take a look at the background cause you never know what you may find.   What are some things you have found in MV's?",1,7

1364,2015-5-29,2015,5,29,13,37om9w,Questions for KCON veterans?,8bitsofawesome,1432873853,"Hey all! With more and more KCON LA and NY info being released, I was wondering if some people who have been before could answer some questions about their experiences. This could potentially be a ton of help for those who have never been, like myself, and for those on the fence about buying tickets.


**1. How much showtime is each artist allocated?** With KCON LA being 3 days as opposed to NY's 1, I imagine the artists in LA will get more time, but because this is the first NY KCON, there's no way of knowing that.

**2. Do the artists play back to back, or are there breaks in between the performances?** This may seem like a naive question, but I am just curious about whether or not I'll be sitting/standing in the same place for hours. Haha.

**3. How is the floor/pits? Are people rude? Is the sound quality/view of the stage good?** I have never once had a good experience in a mosh pit of a concert, and because I'm a tiny person, I'm worried about being shoved and getting hurt as it's happened before. I don't imagine people would do very much moshing at a kpop concert, but you never know, and I just want to be prepared ahead of time.

That's all I've got for now, but I'll update if I think of any more. Please feel free to also just share about your experience in general, because I'd love to read it!

I really appreciate it!",17,2

&gt; B2ST has topped Japan's music charts with ""Can't Wait To Love You""!


&gt; The boys released their Japanese single on the 29th, and the song ranked #1 on Oricon's daily single charts. This is the third song in 3 months that the boys have taken over charts with. ""One"" in March ranked #1, and ""Hands Up"" in April ranked #1 as well. As B2ST is planning to release one song per month for 10 months, this is defintiely a good start for them!


&gt; The song was first revealed through the boys' Japanese fanmeeting that was held in 4 different Japanese cities. It's a song perfect for the summer because of the members' cool vocals.
