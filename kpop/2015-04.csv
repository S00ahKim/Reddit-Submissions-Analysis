Some of you might remember me from 6 months ago or so, I made the [Jombly](http://www.jombly.com/) radio app! Jombly was the result of my frustration trying to find a simple radio application for my various devices that had brand new, just released kpop songs. It's free, has no ads, unlimited skips, works on any device with a browser, and updates its song list daily from official Korean top song lists.

[Jombly](http://www.jombly.com/) started as a tiny personal project, but has grown to about 25,000 daily unique visitors, many of whom have given me some great feedback since the first version. As a result, the following major changes have been made:

1. The entire service is now video based. This was by far the most requested change.

2. Improved error finding - there should be far fewer instances of song covers, live versions, etc.

3. If the vast majority of users thumbs-down a song, it gets reviewed by the service to double check for problems (e.g. a badly recorded cover, mislabeled, etc.). If something isn't right, thumbs-down it and it'll get fixed!

4. Now gathers song data from Korean-language sources (e.g. mnet, gaon, etc.) using translation tools. Song lists should be as current as possible!

5. Vastly lower bandwidth usage for mobile users.

A note on ads: If you're seeing banner ads, it's because they were embedded into the video. I can stop all of the full-screen ads, but unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about the small banners at the bottom of the screen. Adblock should stop them, though! I don't make any money from this, it's purely a labor of love, so don't hesitate to block them.

As always, the best way to support the project is to tell your friends about it!  Questions, comments, suggestions, bugs, etc. can all be posted over at /r/jombly.

There's a showcase in the library that's open/free to view and it'll be up for about 2 weeks.  Then they're holding a movie screening of a documentary about indie KRock ""in a KPop world"" followed by a Q&amp;A.  The finally there's a day-long symposium with several talks and discussions being held.

I'm so psyched!

I hope I don't get side-eyed too much for being white, which has happened in the past  &gt;___&gt;  I feel like this is a big deal since UCSB is a smaller city with a smaller Asian population than some other nearby cities (cough*LA*cough), so I did not expect such a thing to get put on, let alone three events.",12,12

175,2015-4-4,2015,4,4,16,31edqz,What's Your Favorite Concept?,Glensather,1428130893,"I'm honestly surprised I couldn't find this question asked before.

Whether its the sexy concept of groups like Brown Eyed Girls or 4minute, the more innocent concepts of f(x) or SNSD, or the badass concepts groups like BEAST put forward, we all have those types of groups we automatically gravitate towards because we like that type of concept. Of course, groups can and have changed their concepts over time, but you don't always like whatever stage they're going through at that moment.

For me I automatically gravitate toward that sexy/badass type. The cuter/more ""innocent"" groups don't really do anything for me musically (although I hold a soft spot in my heart for f(x)), and there's a good chance I'm like that because my very first experience with Korean music was my mom's old TURBO cassette (also TIL that Kim Jong-kook was a part of that duo because I never knew their names before today and holy shit and I never realized that goddamn and I must have missed that episode of RM if they've brought it up), so that type of music is what stuck in my head until 4minute reintroduced me to that world through Volume Up (although arguably TURBO existed before things like concepts existed like they do now, because listening to some of their old songs I have no idea what's going on).

...well *that* paragraph is a train wreck. But yeah, I know most kpop songs by girl groups are more or less ""oppa pls"" to some degree (but isn't all music?), but since Volume Up was less that and more a ""go fk yourself"" track, I think it stuck with me more. I feel if I were reintroduced to kpop through SNSD or T-ara I never would have gotten back into it.

That said, ""Run Devil Run"" is a good example of a group not normally associated with that style owning it, and it was the first SNSD song I heard that I liked. Likewise, thanks to Invincible Youth I have discovered the magic of Brown Eyed Girls and wished I got back into KPop sooner (Ga In pls).

So anyway, enough about me, what about your favorite concepts?",44,19

**Comments:** I only translated the Top 10 for Songs and Albums because there was no complete ranking past the 10th place. Also the criteria for the digital ranking weren't mentioned. I assume though it's not total sales since Taeyang ranked 2nd in total digital sales on the GAON year end charts but is only 9th here and not included in the report of the 1st half either. So take the data with a grain of salt. The partial translation of the report for the first half can be found [here.](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/07/gaon-chart-releases-chart-rankings-for-the-first-half-of-2014)",10,14

EDIT EDIT: My kakao ID is fusion10sg. Since people want to use that.

This may or may not be related to this sub but I'll post it anyways.

I want to create a club where people who enjoy kpop as much as me can talk about the things we love. I don't really have any friends I can talk to about this. Its my biggest hobby and it sucks that I can't talk about it. I love k dramas and varieties and I love kpop and krap. But I have no one to talk to about.

Basically I want to form a group, outside of reddit, like on Skype or Facebook, that talks about everything Korean related.

I may sound desperate but to be honest I just don't want to be lonely anymore.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and mods remove this if this isn't related to the sub. Sorry in advanced!",64,130

Has anyone had experience using the Melon app (in particular for iOS and desktop)?  I'm looking into getting a plan but wanted some details before I did.  I currently only have an iPod for listening to music on the go.  

* Does Melon have an offline mode where I can still listen to songs such as Spotify where playlists are synced for offline playing?

* What are the pricing options?  I would like one which allows downloading of permanent MP3s as well if available.  

* I was planning on using a [work around](http://www.ksoulmag.com/2015/02/how-to-use-melon-from-overseas/) to get an account as I live in the US.  Does anyone have experience doing this and does it work?",3,0

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=14)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",12,26

Not sure if they're playing it safe with this comeback but I think a lot of us agree that musically, the lines are too repetitive and uniform, resulting in a song that lacks impact. I glove SNSD and I'm sure they can make it work but it's just not very memorable or hard-hatting. 

Throughout their career, SNSD have accrewed numerous achievements and contracted an impressive loyal following. However, recent years of stagnation at the top have resulted in, time and time again, nothing concrete to placate disappointed fans. Even worse, dis*cord* between co-workers has damaged the very foundation of the group. Looking at recent performances, it's evident the girls are lacking in energy and the group as a whole is starting to get rusty. 
 

Considering all the a*foremen*tioned issues, is it perhaps time we faced the reality aboot SNSD's position atop the kpop food chain? Having cemented their status and hit the ceiling of their popularity a while ago, it's only a matter of time before someone else steels the title of Nation's Girl Group. Watt strategies should SM employ that wood permit them to regain their former glory and pave the path for continued relevance in the future? ",37,26

564,2015-4-11,2015,4,11,12,32735h,Kpop songs that sound like American Pop songs...,GATSBYH20,1428723436,"First off, I'm not here to put down Kpop. I'm sincerely just curious because I've noticed a lot of Kpop songs sound like American pop songs.  Obviously, they don't copy the melody or arrangement note for note beginning to end, it's more like a verse here, a riff there, a chorus or bridge here.

For example (and I've noticed a LOT, I haven't been manically keeping track since I started becoming interested in Asian pop music, these are simply examples I noticed from a video I saw today), from songs that charted in April, Be Your Girl by Yeondu sounds like Halo by Beyonce.  Wifey by NS Yoog-G is clearly modeled after I'm Real by J Lo (edited).  Bang Diggy Bang Bang by MFBTYY seems like an homage to Missy Elliot, specifically I'm Really Really Hot. 

Again, I'm cool with it.  I'm just wondering if Korean entertainment companies and music publishers make deals with the owners of these songs or they're just careful to not make it the same enough to lose a lawsuit.  I know American artists do this, too, sort of ""borrow"" musical ideas from their predecessors, not saying Koreans are egregious in this regard, and my awareness of music isn't so all encompassing that I can say with complete confidence that Americans don't steal more from Kpop acts than vice versa.  

Not just in songs, but I feel like a lot of Kpop acts are modeled after American acts that are popular right now.  Like I saw a chubbier Asian girl singer recently that seemed to be modeled after Meghan Trainor.

Thoughts?   ",20,0
565,2015-4-11,2015,4,11,12,3274iv,"Brilliant Kpop Concepts, With No Views",kpopview,1428724301,"So I got bored and made a short list of Kpop MVs that have great concepts but little views on Youtube.  Not positive that I'm allowed to do this, but since they said you can post blog stuff, I would imagine it falls within the guidelines. 

**Rules:** *MV must have less than 1 million views and must be unique in some way.   These MVs are not numbered in any particular order.*

**1.'Have, Don't Have (Don't Have ver.)' - Dal Shabet** [Link](https://youtu.be/2Ur5AFC8C_c) (550,760 views)

*Why I liked it:*  It is filmed in such an odd location, and the director had a serious sense of humor.

*Why it didn't work:* Dal Shabet tried going to the Disco well one too many times... thus the major shift in concept for their last 2, and upcoming release.


**2.'Walking in the Rain' - Verbal Jint** [Link](https://youtu.be/7C-yY_Vx6Jk) (834,198 views)

*Why I liked it:*  Sure there are MV's that have rain in them... but this is the first MV I've seen, that from start to end is drenched in rain.

*Why it didn't work:*  Verbal Jint and Bumkey are both a little underrated and are on a smaller label.  Therefore, they don't get as many views as they probably deserve.


**3.'MUSICHE' - CRAZYNO** [Link](https://youtu.be/fAy4L7qvhW4) (259,912 views)

*Why I liked it:*  The most  MV of this whole post, and very unique in a sense.  The song and MV depict CRAZYNO's struggle to fit into Korea, coming from Australia.

*Why it didn't work:*  Song truthfully is not that great, and his ""o-o-original beat"" isn't very original (See [Here](https://youtu.be/vCadcBR95oU)).  I'd be surprised if we ever saw him again.


**4.'Poison' - Takers** [Link](https://youtu.be/NOPN29odTgs) (55,232 views)

*Why I liked it:*  Not a popular group, and I haven't heard much from them recently, but on a limited budget they managed to come up with a pretty funny MV.

*Why it didn't work:*  Takers is one of those groups I barely stumbled upon.  They are not a big name group and most likely will never be a big name group without the promotions and advertising of a big label.

**5.'You were not the..' - Miss $** [Link](https://youtu.be/k_nLGVxmrIE) (138,672 views)

*Why I liked it:*  Brand New Music tends to put out some really good MVs for their artists and this is no exception.  Very well executed one-take POV.

*Why it didn't work:*  Miss $ has a harder time getting fans because of their genre I think.  In my opinion this wasn't one of their best songs either.


**6.'Snake' - A-JAX** [Link](https://youtu.be/h57eQKCxUac) (184,212 views)

*Why I liked it:*  In an effort to gain a fan base, A-JAX completely turned away from their previous group images to try something new.  Overall the MV is very cheesy but worth a watch.  You may notice that this is the same set that was more recently made famous by Red Velvet.

*Why it didn't work:*  A-JAX isn't meant to be a cute group.


**7.'You, Don't look elsewhere!' - Girl's Day** [Link](https://youtu.be/0QRjfWmv6z4) (As noted by many I messed up, this video has over a million views on the official channel 1,447,453)

*Why I liked it:*  So you didn't like watching a bunch of cute guys and would rather watch cute girls?  This MV is for you.  Unique in the sense that they had the Girls shoot (part of) the MV.  No breakthroughs in videography, but a fun MV nevertheless.

*Why it didn't work:*  This is prior to Girl's Day's sexy image breakthrough where they suddenly became popular.  Plus not everyone cares to watch an MV of girls being silly.



**8.'Love Satellite' - Clazziquai Project** [Link](https://youtu.be/EC7YT_ouhOk) (168,189 views)

*Why I liked it:*  Yes Mr./Mrs. critical... I know there are about 5 [b](https://youtu.be/_WKkX-4HHP0)...[i](https://youtu.be/zO9RzrhYR-I)...[l](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72se2qL33y4)...[l](https://youtu.be/AXEatQ0R-rg)...ion MVs that have someone creepily spying on someone else.  But keep in mind this is an alien, and he has a pig nose... Therefore tally one up on the originality scoreboard.

*Why it didn't work:*  Clazziquai isn't a mainstream group, plus the MV is pretty weird... I love the song though.


**9.'Party (XXO)' - Glam** [Link](https://youtu.be/5T62b-FxzxA) (862,920 views)

*Why I liked it:*  The MV is very colorful and flashy, but what makes it unique is the gay friendly lyrics and theme.

*Why it didn't work:*  Being honest, this is still a very controversial topic in Korea.  This was also Glam's debut.

*edit*

**10.'Don't Be' - A.T** [Link](https://youtu.be/sigtkb588oo) (49,273 views)

*Why I liked it:*  The least views yet possibly the most original of all the MVs in this list.  Using the trampolines was a really, really neat idea.

*Why it didn't work:*  Song is just OK in my opinion, and although the MV is very unique, there isn't quite as much thrill in this MV as your general drama filled one.

**Bonus:' Dancing Queen (Live)' - Crayon Pop** [Link](https://youtu.be/xyysCKBqtCY) (130,184 views)

*Why I added this:* This is a very unique concept but is a Bonus because it is a live stage (MV has over a million views).  Before ""Bar Bar Bar"" gave Crayon Pop fame, they were one of the most entertaining groups to watch grow because of how different their approach was from all the other girl groups.  Starting with their promotions, Crayon Pop went countless times out on the streets to try and get a fan base.  You can watch all of their street performances on their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/crayonpopvideo/videos).  I picked ""Dancing Queen"" because this came before ""Bar Bar Bar"" and has in my opinion, even better choreography to it.  Even the lyrics are silly, and they are supposed to be!  Then you have the outfits... leopard print track suits, with the hoods up, with tryout cards on the front.  I could go on forever about the group, but Crayon Pop definitely earned their fame.

As some of you may remember, I'm collecting fan letters to go to Girls' Generation for SONEs in North America (well, elsewhere if you want to pay int'l shipping). 

You're not too late; I'm collecting them until May 20th. I had a few announcements/guidelines in my original post which you can find here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/30blen/fan_letter_to_girls_generation/

A question I've been getting: No, idk if SM will allow letters addressed to Jessica. What I'm going to do is translate all of them and send them all (that aren't creepy). 

Thanks everyone, and hopefully we can show Girls' Generation their popularity across the world!

When I asked her why she thought that, she said something along the lines of ""K-pop fangirls get all hot and bothered when there's a new boy band with a lot of members. Just look at what happened to Super Junior. EXO replaced them"". Thoughts?",14,0

=======================================================
Until now, artists picked fans, who were not picked during the normal lottery, to receive special prizes during Happy Hour.
However, starting from spring 2015, Happy Hour rewards will only be applied to members in the Mwave MEET&amp;GREET live studio audience.

To start, fans will be allowed to visit the Mwave MEET&amp;GREET broadcast studio on the day of the broadcast and enjoy the live show.
 Condition : Only eligible for fans located in Korea
 The No. of people who can participate : Max. 10
 How to participate : Before the live MEET&amp;GREET, the artist's agency will recruit fans wishing to attend the live show through SNS or fan cafs. You can apply to attend the live show then.

Page No. 173(Niel) will be the last MEET&amp;GREET episode in which the previous Happy Hour rules will apply
=======================================================

The old ""Happy Hour"" was usually signed posters or othe small prizes awarded to random fans after the regular selected winners were finished.

Full summary is here: http://mwave.interest.me/meetgreet/notice/151881/view

I buy quite a bit from the M&amp;Gs and won a Happy Hour prize once so I wonder how it will change the dynamic of the flow of the broadcast with a live audience and if they'll find something for the paying fans to fill the gap of extra gifts not being there...?

And this is my first OP to reddit in general so hopefully it doesn't mess up! :)",7,12

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=14)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)

850,2015-4-17,2015,4,17,8,32v0dy,Theory on why Kpop has mostly a female fanbase!,MEMicster1,1429225224,"(Other than being that not many guys like pop music in general), notice how most Kpop songs are love related, and it involves dancing. Think about how in America, where if a straight male likes a girl bands/boy bands or female singer/male singers (who has mainly female fans like JB, JT, Usher, Ed Sheeran, etc.), they will get heavily criticize and their sexuality gets questioned. Thus indicating, this type of music is mainly for girls. I don't think a Korean version of that is gonna change much of that, because they know its still for girls.

I, myself (a straight male), will honestly admit that I actually some Kpop (both male &amp; female), but I self-conscious about it because the thought of liking girly music kinda makes me  wonder if something is wrong with me. Even though I like all other kinds of music (rock/metal, rap, r&amp;b, etc.), the thought of liking music that are for girls kind of bothers me. 

So yeah, that is my take away on why not many guys (straight ones at least), like Kpop. But I want to ask: Is it wrong for straight men to like Kpop?",46,0

- There are 11 Celebrity Judges and 88 Audience members who have votes.
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.

- The 11 celebrity judges and 88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

This Week's Judges:

- Kim Sung Joo - Main MC (Dad, Where Are We Going?)
- Kim Gura - Sub MC (JTBC War of Words, MBC Radio Star, Quiz to Change the World)
- Shin Bong Sun (Heroes, Happy Together)

[Right now it looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/EwtC5HW.png)

I think a fun little change to this subreddit would be to save a similar rotation. For the number subscribed we could use fandom names and for the number active we could use some play on song names/lyrics. Examples:

33941 4nias / 449 going C.R.A.Z.Y.

33941 SONEs / 449 genies giving wishes

33941 EXO-Ls / 449 calling their babies

...and so on.

This is just one of those little, silly changes that livens up the place just a bit more. What do you guys think?",39,71

Why are they doing this?

I really wanted to discuss for my women's gender class Korean Pop music and South Korean beauty standards. However, I'm kind of at a loss of where to begin or what specifically I can discuss.
 Can anyone provide any controversial moments in Kpop related to women in Kpop?
I know for sure that I want to discuss the high rate of plastic surgery, but that's about all I have.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=14)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",9,23

So I recently fell in love with this song after hearing at a sushi place and was wondering if you had any suggestions of similar sounding/tempo songs?

So far I can only think of BoA's Only One and Disturbance, maybe Taeyang's I Need A Girl - but then again I've been out of the Kpop game for a long while now (aka when DBSK were still 5 members^sobsob and Epik High and Tablo have 2-3 new albums now?!).

So hey, long time lurker, sometimes poster here!

I've been toying with the idea of a Kpop/k-hiphop podcast for while now, since I got interested in the genre. Where I live, there's nobody else (that I know of) interested in Kpop. So I figured to get some cool discussion going I could start a podcast! Because there's nothing I love more than discussing music. I guess what I'm asking is whether anyone would be interested in maybe joining and being on it with me. I think it'd be cool to have a small group (maybe even alternate some people between episodes?) to encourage lots of discussion.

As far as format goes I think we'd cover the biggest news/scandals etc of the week, discuss the new songs and albums released since the last episode, we could even do a section every episode on a smaller artist or a rookie group and maybe answer some questions a few episodes (if it takes off and we actually have any listeners). The music and surrounding scene would totally be the focus, but I wouldn't want it to be super structured. More like just a casual thing of people hanging out talking about music, y'know?

If you wanted to be on it you pretty much don't have to do anything but talk, I'll take care of the editing and such. As long as you have a decent mic anyone can join in.

So yeah that's essentially my idea, just for a little fun. If you wanna be a part of it let me know by pm or posting here or whatever. If you don't want to be on it but still have suggestions of what you want to hear, you can leave those in the comments here too.

**EDIT: IF YOU WANT TO HELP, PM ME WITH YOUR SKYPE NAME (AND MAYBE A LIL BIT OF BACKGROUND ON YOU) BECAUSE THERE'S WAY MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED THAN I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE AND I CAN'T CHOOSE YOU ALL TO BE ON THE PODCAST :(**",48,48

1332,2015-4-26,2015,4,26,19,33wr9d,"I host a Kpop podcast called ""This Week in Kpop"". After two years and 67 episodes, we just passed 100,000 downloads.",twikstephen,1430045545,"Recently there was a post about some redditers wanting to start a Kpop podcast, which lovely user /u/mockingjayy pointed out to me, and a bunch of people were wondering if Kpop podcasts even existed. So...hello!

My name is Stephen and with my friend Josh we host ""This Week in Kpop"", a podcast that covers the latest Korean music video releases. I began the podcast over two years ago because I didn't have anyone to talk to about Kpop and I wanted to start a discussion with like minded people. Originally I forced my friend Kelvin to start listening to Kpop with me, but since then I met Josh when we both moved to Korea to start teaching English. This also allows us to bring in the Korean perspective of what's hot in Kpop!

We pride ourselves on not being fanboys and able to love or criticize any group, but we fully admit we have some imbalances on the podcast as we are both guys and are naturally more interested in girl groups. We actually love it when our listeners tell us that while they had some disagreements with our thoughts they loved the discussion.

We try and release an episode every two weeks. We release the video version of the podcast first on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Thisweekinkpop). Two days later I release the audio version with the songs edited in [on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-kpop/id594315562?mt=2&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4). I personally prefer the audio version because the quality is much nicer, it has the songs edited in, and you can listen to it while driving, working, or doing chores. 

I hope some of you check out our podcast! If you are one of those people who got us to 100,000 downloads, then much much love my chingus. If you want to start your own, I'd be happy to share my knowledge and what I've learned too.

Thanks!",14,54

It's gonna be a mix of ratchet/turn up anthems (think Drake's new mixtape, YG, etc...), trap, the hottest Korean rap/pop tracks (think ""IT G MA"", Dok2) and live performance from beat scene artists.

We're really trying to do something different for NYC nightlife as a whole not just for the Asian American scene. It's at SOB's after all lol.

If you check the FB event, you'll see we have Weekend Money, Go Yama, DJ GetLive, and a few other acts lined up for the night. The party will be hosted by Rekstizzy. Use promo code ""Sanrio"" for a $5 discount when checking out.

Come through, have fun, network, all that good shit. We're aiming to make this party the east coast equivalent of Spam n Eggs, the party organized by Dumbfoundead and Far East Movement so we're aiming big and want you all to be a part of the experience. Hope I get to meet some of you there :)

Hey everyone, mes from OneHallyu here. OneHallyu is having it's second anniversary this weekend, so we are hosting a giveaway this week, and I'd like to invite all of you to check it out as well!

I know I've posted some content, mainly news on both this subreddit and OneHallyu, so why not share this with you guys too!

I know there used to be inappropriate re-directs sometimes when people tried to access the forum, but rest assured, we have finally cleaned out the coding within the forum and there are no more inappropriate redirects.

Check out the link for the requirements and prizes! They're pretty good, if I must say so myself

Thank you /r/kpop!

and i thought it'd be fun for kpop.  but i know that it would inevitably lead to opinions and other subjective ratings

so i thought which boy band has made the most money in music sales (this means, cf's, movies, tv appearances do not count)

you can define your winner by album sales/$$ amount/or however else one might fairly count it.

Round 1: In Korea alone

Round 2: In the world

This is for all time going back to however long you can recall. i tried googling this but its not clearly there.  maybe some of you that are more into kpop culture and such might be able to answer this",11,4
