We all know SNSD topped kpop for a very long time (and is even topping now, after a long battle with Wonder Girls and Kara) However, because of their very long hiatus every comeback, several younger groups showed potential. Like **Miss A, Sistar, Girl's Day** but after 4(?) years of these groups, Sistar seems making the best name among them all.

Now with the success of AOA and A Pink with respective catchy songs, I'm guessing who would follow the footsteps of SNSD and Sistar.

Also I hate when articles give long winded explanations on releases and you have to scroll all the way down to even search for the release date.  K-Pop ""journalism"" gets on my nerves a lot.

So, Hallyujuku is my passion project podcast with my friend Kaz in which we cover the goings-on in East-Asian Pop Culture. (Everything But Anime [Since we have friends that already do Anime podcasts] was our starting point motto.) We mostly talk about K-Pop but dabble in J-Pop on our show, thus is reflected in our ""Best Of"" recaps and in one winner.

We didn't have an absolute quantifiable decision-making process. We just based all of our inclusions on our opinions and on our observations of the impact each group or artists throughout the year in varying ways. We definitely missed a bunch of stuff. Partly because we didn't catch everything, and partly because not everything left a lasting impression on us.

Also, for our ""Best Comebacks"" we ended us meaning established acts' 2014 as a whole.

**Best Girl Group Debuts**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/fsQyz3kKsHo)

We crowned Mamamoo as our rookie of the year because of the consistent quality of releases from their pre-debut tracks to their debut song in ""Mr. Ambiguous"" to the killer jam ""Piano Man"". That, combined with their stellar stage presence and commanding charisma, made it an easy decision.

Other strong contenders included Purfles and their polished debut release ""1,2,3"" and Red Velvet with a solid debut despite SM's faulty management skills. We forgot to include Lovelyz, though we see that they have impressed many out there. I think the style of song and music video didn't hook us and we ended up letting them slip from our memories of this year. Despite the fact that they would not have won over Mamamoo for us, we should have included them in our discussions and we're sorry about that.

**Best Girl Group Comebacks**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/ahE7zCIy0SA)

There were quite a few groups that we could've considered for Best of 2014. We have a lasting love in our hearts for 2NE1 and I myself am an avid Sone. We could've also given it to f(x), who we both love, based on the pure quality of ""Red Light"", which is one our favourite albums to come out in K-Pop in a while. We ultimately went with crowning a group that definitely made 2014 **their** year, and that is A Pink. This year was the year that they solidified their spot near that top tier of girl groups in K-Pop.

Side Note: We didn't end up talking about Ladies Code during our talk. I imagine our exclusion was a subconscious decision to avoid that sadness, but that did end up short-changing two solid releases in ""So Wonderful"" and ""Kiss Kiss"". We apologize for that as well.

**Best Male Group Debuts**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/-icZoadyP7U)

There were a ton of Male group debuts this year and we imagine many of them are fairly popular. However, only a couple of them really made a lasting impression on us. Thus, our best debut title was down to either Got7 or Winner. In our hearts, we preferred Got7 and I personally think Jackson is a variety MVP in the making. However, we had to acknowledge that Winner had the biggest impact in gaining immediate recognition and mainstream popularity. Combined with the quality of their initial releases, we had to crown them our best debut. 

**Best Male Group Comebacks**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/-730KG2ROrA)

This is where we get ourselves into a sticky situation. We didn't anticipate we would have as much to talk about as we did when it came to established male groups this year. We had a bunch of great groups to pick from, but ultimately to us it was down to Block B and EXO. Though we acknowledge the massive powerhouse that is EXO and are fans ourselves, we just thought Block B (similarly to A Pink) really made 2014 their year and they just felt like **our** best in show this year.

**Best Solo/Duo/Collab/Band/Etc. Debuts**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/izdBmljdIRo)

This where our inclusion of J-Pop affects things, because we crowned FEMM our best debut this year based on sheer amount of back-to-back quality bangers released. (Though I haven't discussed this with Kaz) If we were just talking about **only** K-Pop, I'd say our winner would most likely have been HA:TFELT. Odd name aside, Yenny's solo debut was musically fascinating, really well made and creative, and really surprised the both of us

**Best Solo/Duo/Collab/Band/Etc. Comebacks**

[Our Video Discussion](http://youtu.be/DGPyotQKPEk)

There's just no denying the juggernaut that is ""Some"". We had so much that we loved in our list this year, but nothing was as impactful to the industry as Sistar's Soyou collaboration with labelmate solo singer JungGiGo. It brought a budding slang term() into the mainstream Korean lexicon. Additionally, it gave Soyou the klout to say ""Hey, I wanna be the female singer in Urban Zakapa"" and more-or-less make it happen with ""The Space Between"". We also thouroughly enjoyed Epik High's album and I plan on introducing it to non-kpop-loving friends as a quality album. We also had solid contenders this year in HyunA (we adore her in so many ways), Gary, Gaeko, Taeyang (to our surprise), Rain, and a few more which we cover in our video.

I made a list of 20, but you can do whatever number you feel comfortable with, I suppose.

[Here's mine for example](https://twitter.com/omgHyosung/status/551025777009909761)

It took me a while to finish up that list and I really struggled, but it was fun. If you don't have Twitter, I encourage you to post your list here.

If you want to help spread this on Twitter, you can add #topkpop2014 and nominate your friends!

Thanks and have fun!

If you like Neon Bunny or Yukari, or perhaps IU's Sokyeokdong, or Vanilla Acoustic, chances are you might like Oh Hee Jung as well. She used to be the vocalist for Korean indie rock band Beautiful Days (which is also worth checking out; *Boy + Girl* is one of my favorite Korean albums) and has since put out two albums of self-composed/produced chillout electronic pop, a remix album, and now this three-track collab mini album where she provides vocals for songs by Czech indie artist Kubatko. 

Her instrumentals tend to range from loungy electronica to indie acoustic. Here are some of my older favorite songs from her:

Not any artistic merits to support it, but mostly because they are the most prevalent around Korea.* Nevermind this is a fan vote. 

So naturally, fans get angry. At this point you might be thinking, ""Hey, kpop fans gonna kpop."" But no, they go ahead and give their expert reasoning.

And they decide to take a parting shot against the very base that pays their nice apartment: 

&gt; I don't know why I'm still surprised at how overwhelmingly vitriolic, hateful, and unhealthy kpop fans can be.

Also, they called the BTS fandom trash or something similar, although I wasn't able to find the tweet in question. By this point, EYK is blocking kpop fans and deleted the Hitler tweet. 

/u/simonandmartina, since I KNOW you guys are on Reddit, it's best that you maybe clear the air and maybe offer and apology? And serve as a reminder on how childish these two ""media personalities"" are acting. ",8,0

There was [news of their comeback](http://www.koreaboo.com/comebacks/spica-will-return-stage-november-comeback-ghost/). I swear there were promos on music shows for their impending comeback as well.

I've tried to dig up info on what happened, but came up with nothing. Anyone know?

Some people who were in their MV posted pictures from the set on [instagram](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5To5LaIIAE30O3.jpg)  (think back to the Good Boy MV...that happened there too) only to delete them later. [One of the pictures even had IRON in it](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5ToPjCCYAEfk7p.jpg). Also note that one (or even all three, not sure) of the guys is in both pictures. 

Of course they later deleted them but fans had already snapped screen shots. On top of that, IRON was the first person Jonghyun followed when he joined instagram (and the only one for quite a while).

From the pictures themselves and knowing Jongyhun and IRON, we're probably getting a rock track with some rapping from them.",10,42

308,2015-1-8,2015,1,8,9,2roqc8,What are your thoughts on the current state of Kpop?,affabillyty,1420675745,"(This thread was inspired from a side discussion here about the SXSW 'Kpop line-up being less Kpop and more K-Indie)

One thing I've noticed from the 2014 releases is that Kpop really has exploded and the so-called Hallyu wave covers many more types of genres than what I used to think of as Kpop.

I think what was special about Kpop as a genre was that it revived late 90's pop traditions that were ultimately bullied out of the marketplace for being too docile or too overly produced by their labels, ie. inauthentic. They took it to a new level by creating larger than life groups (9+ members), doing fan service and Aegyo galore. I don't think many people would dispute ""Gee"" as being one of the most quintessential Kpop songs.

If you were to visualize it, you could almost put songs like ""Gee"" at the center of a Kpop circle and map out how far away other songs/groups fall from that archetype. Eventually you'd have to just put things in other genres because they'd no longer simply be Kpop.

Looking at the so-called Kpop hits from this year, some of the biggest seem very far removed from that Kpop essence. Take G-Dragon x Taeyang ""Good Boy"" for example. The similarities it has to the Kpop core are far fewer than a hip-hop/trap song you'd find from a Western release - except maybe that it's sung in Korean. (Off the top of my head, ""Mr. Chu"" is one of the 2014 releases that sticks to that core)

I have no problem with a multifarious Korean music industry obviously, but I think the infatuation with Kpop has less to do with the core Kpop sound/culture nowadays, and is more about all things Hallyu, which to me is a little strange because Hallyu is starting to mimic the many different genres of Western music anyway.

**TL:DR;** The Hallyu wave is starting to incorporate more parts of the Korean music industry, but we should still reserve the term ""Kpop"" for a specific genre within that industry.

The photos seem to be from the set of a MV filming. Unfortunately she didn't say anything in the photo captions nor has she really said anything on Twitter. So the photos aren't conclusive evidence that she's filming a MV for her upcoming US debut, but I'd say it's a pretty strong hint.

I believe you film a MV after finishing the album, so if that's true then this could mean CL is in the final stages of preparing for her US debut. My guess is they will release the album or MV on February 26 since that is CL's birthday.

409,2015-1-10,2015,1,10,4,2rvy4w,Will Kpop be it's own downfall?,LadyPearl82,1420831909,"I've been thinking about this for a while now and thought it would be a good discussion on why do you think Hallyu will be it's own downfall? 

I definitely have been thinking about this for a while now and I think if any force is going to be the downfall of Hallyu it's itself. Here's why I think so:

1) With international fans it seems like, from what I can gather in my own experience, that the ages of fans are teenagers and fans from 20-30. Usually around the mid to late 20's is when fans start to get tired of things and move on. In Korea Kpop is for teenagers and from what I understand by the time you get to University it's seen as childish and that's when people start liking bands and solo singers. I myself have noticed I'm starting to get to this position too. 

2) Misrepresentation.  I've been around for a long time and from my own experiences with fandom culture with international fans online is that people do misrepresent. They will rewatch video's as a group to make it bigger than what it really is. They will restream. I've seen international fandom sites get together to bulk buy. 

3) Over the yrs one reason why I see people say they get tired of Kpop is the fandom wars and stuff. Thankfully it doesn't seem to be an issue here but it seems to be anywhere where there is a large community of fans whether it's on social media or message boards.

4) The last thing is Kpop will always be first and foremost about Korea. Now we're seeing Kpop idol acts branching out more. China is going to be heavily with activity from companies this year according to plans that have been released from companies. From what I understand in China Kpop really isn't a thing with the general public. It's not here in the US. It took some time for it to happen in Japan and now Japan is slowly getting away from it as well. When these acts go away they will probably eventually have to choose Korea or wherever they're going. If they choose Korea they will lose out on a potential market like with China or here in the US or South America.  They will lose their base in Korea and could go the way of the Wonder Girls.

So, what do you think? Why do you think Kpop will be it's own downfall? ",35,0

I know it's not super-professional and mostly a hub of links, but I still get messages every once in a while saying how useful the site is. So, THANK YOU!

I've been working on converting KPOPPY to a responsive design over the last year. The new design is up now. 

**[LINK to the new KPOPPY.com](http://kpoppy.com/)**

If you want to compare it to the old version for some reason: [Link here](http://kpoppy.com/old_info.html). I'll be taking it down if all goes well with the new design.

**It's becoming tradition that you guys give KPOPPY the ol' reddit hug on these occasions. Don't worry if the site crashes. The bandwidth is minimal. If it goes down, come back in a day or two when you have some time.**

The content is largely the same with a few additions here and there (mostly from your suggestions). But now everything should re-size and re-organize dependent on the size of screen you are looking at. I haven't had much opportunity to check it on different screens, so I'm employing your help to look at it on your various mobile devices.

Okay, down to business. You don't need to answer this like a questionaire. If there is just one issue you can bring up, please do! Here is how YOU can help:

DESIGN:

* Anything. Whatever suggestions, criticisms, or questions you have, I want them!
* Does the responsive design work for you? Is it an improvement on the old version? Does it look bad or clunky? Is there too much squishing in a narrow format? Does the navigation bar make sense or is it confusing?
* If you tried it on a mobile device, which device, and how did it look?
* There are some moving accordion panels and other fiddly bits (like the Prologue). Working? Not working?

MUSIC CONTENT:

* The Top20 has been expanded to a Top30. The added 10 groups, their descriptive terms and MVs, are all up for debate. **(SEE MY POST IN COMMENTS)**
* At the bottom of the OTHER GENRES section, [there is a new list for the artists who promote in Japan](http://kpoppy.com/music.html#engjpn). I have most of the major ones in there. Help me add more. I'm not looking for groups that have a one-off Japanese track or a couple singles. Let's try to keep it to artists that have at least TWO full albums. Who am I missing?

Commenting here will obviously be the easiest, since you're already here, but feel free to email me at the address in the footer, or tweet me, or use the ""SEND MESSAGE"" contact form down there. It works, but it will just clear the fields when you hit Send. I keep forgetting to add the script to make it confirm sending. Just trust that your message has been received until I get around to that. Lol.

Anything you want to bring to the table, bring it!

Thank you all!

I mostly worry for the acts who aren't behind a major label or have major popularity.  Boyfriend is going there as well this year as their label mates Sistar who could do well.

From what I understand is that Kpop really isn't a thing in China but there is a thing there for K dramas but there's a potential for Kpop. 

It's smart of companies to send idols there now before a wave does hit there and even more competition like how it is in Japan now.

I'm definitely of the thought China, more than anywhere else, is going to be the new frontier of Kpop. Personally, I always think it's a good idea to share pop cultures with each other and it's how we can as a people grow and progress with something non-threatening and fun. That's one thing I admire with the South Korean government/people in using Hallyu to spread information in a non-threatening way to people about Korea and Korean people. 

So, what do you think of Kpop idols going to China more? ",26,0

429,2015-1-10,2015,1,10,15,2rxy6c,What does a group need to skyrocket their popularity?,SeeDiminished,1420871681," With the recent post on digital and physical sales revealing 'tiers', as well as Apink's rise, I was wondering what a group would need to get really popular. From what I've heard, Apink just had a series of really solid releases, but I feel like that's kinda vague. Surely we could be more specific about what a group needs to 'rise'. 

Here were some of the things I was thinking of:
* Some members need to improve their singing/dancing  
* Improve looks? Maybe skinnier/musclier, plastic surgery or w/e  
* Cuter or sexier concept? Maybe people just don't find them attractive enough, or doesn't really suit their strengths It's possible an entirely new concept will get new attention.  
* Seasonal timing? Matching the concept to the season and how people feel at the time.  
* More catchy song?  Maybe it's a matter of finding the right song to really get people addicted to your group.   

While this is obviously the answer would be more group-specific, I think we could still have a pretty good discussion. I'm not that familiar with kpop yet so I can't really give in-depth answers for individual groups :/ 

EDIT: This is what I've gathered from your comments:

You have to be:  
* Managed and promoted well (events, variety, etc.)  
* Stand out and stick (catchy song/dance, distinct members, have a unique characteristic', consistency)  
* Get lucky with timing comebacks.  

Things that can help are:  
* Luck  
* Fancams  
* Not showering  
* Being part of the big 3  
* BRAVE SOUND  
* Luck  


Anyone have thoughts for what specific groups need?

I'm probably going to not get much feedback but I honestly am not plugging my site. I just want some feedback as to what /r/kpop wants to see. It's a pretty standard affair - we cover the standard news, rumour mill, music videos etc but our house style is very different. Less direct translations into articles. 

Already I know the site sounds boring but I believe this could work for some. 

Any immediate criticisms would help so yeah, tell me your thoughts.

EDIT: Thanks everyone who's commented so far. After some more planning from your suggestions, what about editorials completed by readers? An editorial explaining one side is good but then to hear other opinions from the readers might be interesting?

My main points for the site are to not just translate news by presenting facts written in a more entertaining/readable way, to try and maintain good journalism without clickbait, be aware of our editorials by considering the negatives of Kpop, and to do so, I'm thinking about editorials / dedicating a space for content submitted by readers.

If so that would definitely get her into the market as they are two huge producers right now and the American music industry is taking a turn into that type of music and without a doubt i think we should expect a collaboration with nicki or iggy if she really does succeed in the US market.

To mark this historic year, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Canada launched the Korea-Canada Blog (www.korcan50years.com) to record the many stories of friendship and cultural events celebrated throughout the year. This successful blog reached out to 400,000 readers in over 200 countries around the world.

On the heels of that momentous year, Koreans and Canadians joined together once again in 2014 to celebrate the signing of a landmark free trade agreement and the launching of a Strategic Partnership that will have synergy effects in all aspects of our daily lives, from business and technology to sports, education, and culture.

In 2015, the Korea-Canada Blog will continue to share updated, informative, and entertaining articles that reflect this new and exciting era in Korea-Canada relations.

To contribute to the blog, the Embassy is recruiting voluntary e-Reporters who can discover and write about Korea-Canada relations and Korean culture in their communities as civil diplomats.

An interest in international relations, global issues, and Korea-Canada relations, combined with great storytelling and social media aptitude will be valuable assets in the selection of successful candidates.

New: [Image](http://i.imgur.com/M6vwVWC.jpg)

The ""newspaper"" previously had the first two paragraphs of the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) on World war 2 with the second paragraph pasted first. (because it contained stuff about The Empire of Japan)

It is now replaced by the text copied from [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Pop) on Crayonpop.

**Edit:**

The MV was produced by [RainbowBridge artist agency](http://www.rbbridge.com/) in collaboration with Crayonpop and we don't reall know which part or individual was responsible for the WW2 reference.",7,17

&gt; Comment: *Well, I am indeed at a loss for words with the production of this Awards Ceremony. I'm sure if you saw the online broadcast, we can list all the things that was done poorly. =( Also, the JTBC broadcast is not until at a later date. So the only viable live stream was the Chinese streaming site.*

&gt; *Apologies on the Low Quality videos since they are the best we can get for now with the current uploaders. Will update the thread when there are more uploads.*

&gt; *Tomorrow will be the Day 2 broadcast focused on the actual Album awards. Today was focused more on Singles/Song Titles.*

My first girl group was SNSD, but from there I am still stanning f(x), WG, kara, 4min, and now I also stan lovelyzz, sonamoo, apig, 9mu, dal shabet, sistar, and that's about it.

Most others I like I just end up being a casual fan/only pay attention when they're promoting (like a monthly subscription) the gg I listed I follow like a weekly anime so that's the difference.

Also how was your week so far?

I'm not sure as to how many people on reddit watch this show, but I've been in love with it. I was really hoping that KiHyun's team would win this round, especially since I love basically every single person on that team. I was so proud when they won, but for next week, I know that ShowNu's team has an advantage when it comes to dancing. 

I honestly don't know what to expect but I think that ShowNu's team has a bigger chance of elimination; Ill admit that I'm pretty bias towards KiHyun's team though. If ShowNu's team is facing elimination, I think that MinKyun or MinHyuk will be eliminated. If it's KiHyun's team, it'll probably end up being SeoKwon or YoonHo.

&gt; Comment: *Links maybe temporary and will replace/update once MBC uploads them on their own channel. Please note that MBCkpop youtube uploads selective performances and does not post all of the performances on its channel.*

&gt; *Music Core thread will always be slightly delayed due to the lack of uploads at the start. I can't have it up right away after the show is done. But it'll be done before morning (EST) for sure.*

&gt; *If I made any mistakes, feel free to point them out and I will promptly edit them.*",12,30

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyOJ-_HfqBM

While the song is obviously high quality, top notch, and what you'd expect from a talented girl group. The choreography may be a bit on the slutty side. It's something you might expect from a Lady Gaga or Niki Minaj MV, but certainly not a wholesome K-pop group.

Does Hello Venus cross the line into miscreant behaviour?

On the 19th, Lee Min Jung's agency MS Team Entertainment announced that she is currently 27 weeks pregnant.
The agency stated ""As a wife, having a child is a blessing, but due to the unfortunate events that have happened recently, we had to be cautious about this, and pay attention to the health and stability of the mother. She was worried about when to reveal the news of her pregnancy.""

""We hope that everyone understands that she had to worry a lot on when to reveal this news. We would like to thank everyone who worried for her during the recent events, and even through all of these worries, she will continue to have a strong heart and do her absolute best for the family. She will work hard to show an even better image to everyone who has waiting and prayed for her.""

Due to this, Lee Min Jung is expected to stay in Korea for the remainder of her pregnancy, looking over her health.",14,14

915,2015-1-20,2015,1,20,15,2t0ycb,[Interview] EvoL talks about their goals and their music,OH_mes,1421735155,"This is a repost in a self post due to the continuing issues of within the server that cause malicious redirects. On behalf of everyone at OneHallyu, I apologize for those redirects, we are working as hard as we can to solve the problem.

~~

OneHallyu was ecstatic when Stardom Entertainment accepted our request to interview EvoL. EvoL is a five-member South Korean girl group that consists of Say, Jucy, Hayana, Yull, and J-Da. The group is under the label Stardom Entertainment which was founded by Cho PD, a hip hop record producer and rapper. In 2012, They debuted with the track We Are a Bit Different, an upbeat and powerful song that demonstrates their confidence. In this interview, OneHallyu asks EvoL about their music, hopes, aspirations, and their upcoming comeback.

**OH!: Hi! Can you give us a little introduction about yourself ? What is the role of each member?**

J: Hi Im Jucy, Im EvoLs darling, but a powerful rapper and the oldest unnie.

Y: Im Yull, who is in charge of main vocals.

S: Im Say, Im our teams leader.

H: Hello, Im Hayana, Im in charge of having a charming voice in EvoL.

JD: Im J-Da. Im EvoLs maknae (the youngest). I am in charge of both rap and vocals.

**OH!: What was your inspiration to pursue music?**

J: When I am rapping, it doesnt matter if theyre from Korea or a different country, I get inspired by a lot by other rappers, especially out of Korean rappers, Dynamic Duo sunbaes, and out of overseas rappers, Nicki Minaj. While watching these rappers, I learn a lot and receive a lot of inspiration.

Y: I get inspired by Mariah Carey. I end up learning a lot from music. As a girl group, I think we get inspired and motivated from other girl groups and other artists.

S: There are a lot of people who inspire me. Family, fans, and musicians around me all inspire me.

H: Since I spent my childhood in a foreign country, I wasnt able to experience K-Pop very much. When I first came to Korea, seeing all of my seniors being able to live their dream is where a lot of my inspiration to be a singer came from.

JD: Normally I try to find videos from my favorite artists on their YouTube channels. While watching videos rather than just listening and because I get more visually stimulated as well, I think I can understand the meaning more deeply. Oh, also when I was young, I used to study classical piano, so sometimes I listen to classical music as well.

**OH!: Is there anyone you look up to as a role model? Why?**

J: Nicki Minaj! My dream is to be the Nicki Minaj of Korea. Really that artist, from not only her rap skills, but the thoughts she fills her songs with, I can feel that she is such a cool artist.

Y: Beyonce, Ariana Grande, and Jessie J. But still, Mariah Carey is how I became interested in music, so she is my role model. I dont settle on just one person as a role model, I am trying to learn different things from many different artists.

S: For me, Michael Jackson. Everything about him is what makes him my role model: choreography, costumes, music, mind, thoughts etc. Everything about him affects me.

H: Hmm.. for me there also isnt just one particular person. I am trying to learn different things from many different artists.

JD: I love Lee Hyori sunbaenim*. Since I was young, Ive been watching Lee Hyori on stage. I think her music style and fashion style are really cool. I respect you Sunbaenim!!!

Sunbaenim is a term to refer to mentor figures.

**OH!: How would you describe your music?**
J: In EvoL, I am the powerful one. Even though the music I want to do is Jazz, our music is hip hop with a heavy beat feeling.

Y: Rather than one genre, I think that we can express many different genres like a chameleon who digests and challenges different things. Haha.

S: We are still in the making ^^ The art of music is formless, you know? Because of that, I dont think you can do music perfectly. If I had to say, I think our music is a 9. Even though our music isnt perfect, I think that we can say that because we are trying to make our music come close to a perfect 10.

H: I have a charming voice. I think our vocal color is our biggest advantage.

JD: EvoLs title songs are very powerful and have easy, addictive choruses. In our album, you can listen to many different musical colors.

**OH!: Out of the songs you have done, which one is your personal favorite and why?**

J: For me, the song called Love has a really positive sound, so its the best. Its a love song, but I think its a song you can experience love vicariously through. I like singing, but I dont like formally training so I didnt try to learn. When I sing, I feel the most free, and I am able to express myself better. I gain energy, and it bursts out of me.

Y: I love all of ours songs, but for me also, the song LOVE is the best. Because the members sing it well, and its bright and lovely, it is even better.

S: I cant just pick one. The songs are more than just songs but now they are our closest friends. (fig meaning: music became our lives)

H: Im different I personally like 1,2,3,4,5! While practicing this song, tears decided to flow. Because we personally wrote the lyrics, its the song that I personally identify with the most and have an unusual attachment to.

JD: Haha me too! Personally, I think the song LOVE is a really bright and lovely song, so I want to recommend it to everyone. Ever since I was young, Ive always really liked songs that I can dance to. If I sing a song I can dance too, I feel excited and happy.

**OH!: How long does it take to film a music video?**

J: It took two full days and nights. Even though we were really tired, it was a pleasant and meaningful experience.

Y: Thats right! It took about two days and one night.

S: If we look at it by hour, it took more than 24 hours. By length, maybe 48 hours?

H: Ha.. normally it takes all day.

JD. Thats right. Normally we film all day and night.

**OH!: How do you feel when you are on stage?**
J: Haha.. Even though I still get nervous and excited, the biggest thrill is our fans supporting us and cheering us on! Fans are jjang (the best)!

Y: I think I know why the word stage addiction** exists. Its really thrilling to communicate with fans and to show the performances that we have been preparing. Just communicating with fans in of itself is so comfortable.

S: I dont think about anything. When I feel the spectators that are watching me on the stage and the music, I feel like I am alive.

H: Im trying to communicate with the audience members through the stage performance.

JD: Before we go on stage, we have a team cheer we always do. From that moment on, it becomes really thrilling. Our cheer is THRILLING, literally thrilling . After doing the cheer, tension rises, and we explosively perform what we have been preparing. First of all, I get joy and excitement when I meet the eyes of the fans or when they are looking at me, words cannot be expressed. Best!

**OH!: What were your first impressions of each other?**

J: Yull seemed like she had a strong personality. J-Da seemed like just a typical girl group trainee. Hayana felt like she came from abroad. I was told Say looked like king cobra the snake. Hahaha

Y: J-Da seemed like she was a high school student. Hayana seemed really feminine, like a princess. Sei looked strong but she didnt look younger than me. And Jucy, since the first impression and until now, she has always felt really playful.

S: Jucy unnie looks like a joyful kid and J-Da looked like a girly girl. Yull unnie looked really cold so it was really hard to approach her at first. Hayana looked like a freshman in college.

H: To me, uh.. there was nothing special. No one had a bad impression.

JD: Finally.. my turn! My first impression of Yull unnie was that she was kind of strong. I thought that Jucy unnie came from abroad. Say unnie looked different from how she looks like. She looked really pure and innocent. Hayana unnie seemed kind of feminine, like how she still is now.

**OH!: Are there any artists you would want to collaborate with?**

J: Nicki Minaj! If I really could, it would be an honor.

Y: Ariana Grande and Jessie J!

S: For me, It would be Timbaland. Hes a producer I really respect.

H: HA:TFELT sunbaenim! I received a lot of inspiration from listening to her solo album. If I have the opportunity, I would definitely love to collaborate with her. Sunbaemin is so cool.

JD: For me, its really Lee Hyori Sunbaenim! She is my role model. I really would love to meet her and stand on stage with her!
**
OH!: What do you think about your international fans from all over the world?**

J: I always am so grateful to them. Even though we cant see each other closely, I always read supportive letters and messages and gain strength from them. Thank you, I love you all!

Y: Its a shame that there are not many to directly communicate with them while being overseas. I dont forget and I am always thankful for the support they give and for liking us.

S: Thank you so much! Even though their bodies are far away, it feels like their hears are always next to us. Fans are such a cool inspiration and because we are always grateful for their existence, we really want to meet them. Lets meet soon 

H: I love you guys! Even though you are far away, because of the fans who are always loving and supporting us we continue to make music and have become the driving force behind our development.

JD: Thank you guys so much. Even though we cant see each other for the time being because we are far away, you are people who always support us and give us strength. Really~ I want to go to every country and repay the support we have received through performances. Please wait for us, everyone~

**OH!: So the word is spreading around that there is an album being prepared in the future, what can we expect from this album? And when will you make a comeback?**

J: Even though I want to stand on stage as soon as possible, we are still in the middle of fixing up the lacking points (in making an album).

Y: Hmm.. we dont have a set schedule. We have personally been working with friends, and we are intensely preparing so we want to go out but we are still checking over everything. I think there will be good rumors soon.

S: Thats right, we are preparing now. Although we cannot be certain as to when because there are still things that are lacking, when we feel things are perfect we will immediately make our comeback. I hope everyone will anticipate it. Dont you think we can meet soon?

H: As for me, I want to try many different things. During the long break period, I was able to spend the time learning about many different things. I want to show the fans the best of the many things that we prepared. Dont you think well be able to meet soon?

JD: We are preparing a different image from our first album! However, honestly even though yesterday we didnt know when it would come out, even tomorrow, it could suddenly come out so we are always preparing!

**OH!: What is your dream/goal for the future?**

J: This is what I really, really want to do. My goal is to have more EvoL comebacks and a solo concert.

Y: Me too! The EvoL members always talk about it, EvoL solo concert!

S: I also want to have a solo concert, but my goal is to win an award at an awards show! Apart from that, there are many different things. That is what I have been dreaming of for a long time.

H: We havent won first place in a weekly chart yet. I definitely want to win first place!

JD: Right now EvoL is really greedy. I want to win an award at an award show and have a solo concert. Later, I would like the opportunity to individually shoot a CF or try acting.

**OH!: Thank you so much for doing this! We will update our site whenever you release a new song! Please leave one more message for your fans as well as those who will check out your music.**

J: Its already the last question  As EvoL, we promise to always continue to grow and develop! Because we can communicate through music, even if its only for one minute, I hope that we can feel empathy with each other and get excited together. Please continue to love EvoL~ I love you guys &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

Y: Hmm what can I say~ Im so thankful that everyone keeps waiting and we will continue to work hard to sing for you guys. ^^

S: I mean seriously I would love you guys to listen to our effort in our songs and what we want to exclaim to the world beyond just melodies. I am really grateful to the fans who come visit us. Ill try best not to disappoint you.

H: We also want to come out with a new album so we are preparing hard. Look forward to us and support us! See you soon.

JD: Ahh its the last question  Even though 1 year has gone by, thank you to the fans who have believed and waited for us. We will greet you through good music!! I love you all!!",0,6

Over the last few months I found myself wanting to listen to entire albums, instead of just songs.  As a result, I looked for, found, and listened to playlists and videos of full albums.  However, I also noticed that there were many albums that just aren't out there in playlist or video form.  With that said, I would like to start a thread for a /r/kpop project to compile loose songs on YouTube into their respective albums.  I will compile the posted playlists and videos of full albums in this post.

***

**How you can help:**

* Post links to playlists and full album videos you have found or made on YouTube

* Post suggestions for albums you would like added

***

**Other Things:**

* To make this easier, at least for me, please post playlists or videos in the following forms

[Playlist] Artist's Name - Album Title

[Video] Artist's Name - Album Title

*For example* 

&gt; [[Playlist] Rain - Rain's World](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1SWAIJrmMt-OczMcAJuzI_ZJScQMzkzY)

&gt; [[Video] Super Junior - Sorry, Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjsKKcP-RxY)

1236,2015-1-27,2015,1,27,11,2tsniy,seo jisoo's scandal (3 months later),wlklpedla,1422325958,"http://entasia.net/threads/seo-jisoo-and-rape-culture.49206/ I recently found this on twitter because major news outlets have seemingly stopped reporting or keeping up on jisoo. Inside contains a screencap that is an alleged translated police report saying how the victims were exposed to be fakes. 

basically link tl;dr - jisoo is innocent of those heinous crimes, the major picture evidences were fabricated (something that we are familiar with to a degree)

my real question is, why aren't people reporting it. as far as I know my friends who didn't take jisoo's side in this case have been dehumanizing her, even going around saying don't support lovelyz as a whole (which made me mad to say the least as the other girls in lovelyz had no part in the case whatsoever). and now they don't even bother to know that jisoo has been cleared of rape charges (or even refuse to acknowledge such but #ok) 

i believe if you stayed neutral while this was playing out all of us had a clearer eye of what's going on. rape is a serious crime but why lie when hundreds are suffering the reality of it. i would rant about why neutrality was important in this extreme case but I want to know what you guys think about this not being """"officially"""" reported. 

EDIT: not saying jisoo is entirely innocent, but if she's gonna go back inside the group without explanation there will be backlash",38,57

I think there's a couple of albums that didn't make it into the picture. I found a tiny store on the 3rd floor of a cosmetics shop in the middle of Seoul. They were super helpful! I bought so much that the clerks there gave me around 15 posters and 20 of those little card things (they can be seen on the far left and far right). 

I don't buy a lot of physical albums online cause they're expensive. They were so cheap in Korea! The newer albums were around ~$20 USD and some of the older ones got as low as ~$8. The 2NE1 bluray was around $45. 

One of my friends was trying to get more into kpop, so I was recommending a lot of albums for her. The clerks would put the album on the store's radio for her to listen to :) They were really sweet! I probably seemed like some obnoxious white kid to them though haha
