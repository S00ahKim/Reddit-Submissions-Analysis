55,2013-11-3,2013,11,3,13,1psikf,Legitimate Concern,iSanyu,1383451488,"Along with the recent trend, starting last year, of having 20 rookie groups debut in one year, is anyone else somewhat bothered by the fact that lately more and more groups have been debuting with at least seven members. Five members used to be the norm, but lately I've been seeing groups debut with more members than necessary.

We have plenty of groups out there with a lot of members that are incredibly popular, (SNSD, Exo, 9Muses, Super Junior), but I feel like they suffer from a problem of having a few really popular members, and then some who aren't that popular. This also attributes to whether they have a large amount of talent or just look good enough that it allows them to overshadow the other members.

I feel like a lot of these companies are just throwing out group after group because they have too many trainies to keep track of and need to debut them. Half the time they fail because they don't have anything that sets them apart from the other 140+ idols in the kpop world. Now I feel like companies are realizing that its much cheaper to put 7-10 members in one group and then give them a song, rather than split them up to showcase their individual talents. 

When groups have large numbers of members, you see more of a few people and nearly none of the others. This is true for for even smaller groups, I understand that, but its more prominent in larger groups. I feel like lately groups with very little talent is being thrown out into the world and then they get bombarded with criticism and hate long before they were ready, and I feel sorry for their groups.

I myself loved the show. The performances by everyone were really outstanding. The interviews with Simon and Martina were funny and entertaining. The MC's were fabulous. Min was beautiful in her dress while Taecyeon and Kris were handsome wearing their suits.

Although there were some awkward moments in the interviews, and on stage, I feel like every single person did their best to provide us with great content.

I wanted to thanks Youtube, all idols/artists who performed, Simon &amp; Martina (EYK), the MC's (Min, Taecyeon &amp; Kris) as well as all the staff for putting on a great show for us fans!",2,3

I've always been a big fan of the Korean hiphop scene, but the last year i started to listen to more then just hiphop, i've always been listening to the ""big"" bands, such as SJ, GG, T-Ara, BB, 2ne1, Kara.. yeah you get the idea.. 
But i've started to listen to alot of the other groups now, everything from debuts to old groups.

Anyway, my question, and my point of this submition is, what do you think about SPICA, and how well do you think they do vocaly against other groups? 

Imo i find them to be the vocaly strongest Kpop group, dont get me wrong i know that we have Sunny Hill, Davichi and other girl group/duets but i dont think they fit under the ""kpop"" description.

Would love to get tips on other groups in kpop with the same kind of crazy vocals!


**TLDR**: Is SPICA the vocaly best girl group in kpop? ",26,20

So, I have a problem. I (in general) have a personality that easily gets addicted to things. When I was younger it was anime/manga, then it was fanfiction, and now it's kpop. It's a real problem for me. I spend far too much time watching or reading the lastest news on kpop. I really can't afford to do so. I have schoolwork that needs to be done, exams I can't afford to fail this semester, and other goals I would like to work on. I end up dropping some club activities I really quite enjoy because I ""don't have time for them"" (meaning I procrastinate too much on hw with kpop and such). I would say this is a general will-power problem, except for my obsession. I feel this NEED to keep updated and I feel a little lost if I haven't checked allkpop for the latest news, or tumblr for gifs of favorite bands. 

I really, really don't like idolizing celebrities. I start dreaming of them as the ""prince in shining armor"" bs, and it actually affects my plans of what I want to do in the future. I'm so distracted by my daydreams that I can't focus on the here and now. I'm supposed to be figuring out what I want to do after graduation and while I know I don't have to have it all figured out, the fact that this dream world kpop grants me is affecting my decision-making...it's extremely worrying.

Sorry for the long rant, but I'm really frustrated with myself, and I need help. I believe moderation is key, but unfortunately, moderation has never really worked with me, and I don't know if I want to ""quit"" kpop cold turkey. I feel I should find something to replace it with - something more productive. It's just very difficult right now, and I could really use some advice...

TL;DR: I'm addicted to kpop and it's adversely affecting my life. It's influencing my plans for the future and my compulsion to stay connected to the latest news and music is actually taking away from other things I care about. Should I 'quit' kpop? I need advice!!!

**EDIT: I've now blocked allkpop. I've unfollowed almost all the kpop blogs on tumblr, and hope to be leaving that website soon, as it hasn't really benefited me or brought be happiness for the year I've been on it. I'm narrowing it down to just eatyourkimchi and following one or two bands (probably just going to k2nblog and downloading albums). After my exams this week, I'll be returning to one of the clubs I enjoyed earlier this year. I'm going to get my guitar strings replaced so I can pick that up again. It'll be hard, but I think I can do it. A lot of this obsession was due to my fear of growing up and graduating - kpop let's me feel like a little girl again, which is a lot easier to be than an adult. I think once I start dealing with those issues, my obsession will also start to die away.

Thank you to everyone who has responded. Addictions are a serious thing - whether it's drugs or alcohol, or something as seemingly innocuous as games or a genre of music, they can seriously affect your life. I really appreciate all the understanding and consideration from everyone on this subreddit - you've all been so kind, and I don't think you know how much it means for you to have read this and not judged me.

[As translated from a Korean fan account]
My friends and I were waiting at a small shop near the departure door because there were a lot of fans who sat on the floor so we couldn't get to the very front. The fans started practice singing and all, so we followed along then a couple minutes later they all started getting up because soshi arrived from the right side and we all sang Complete. The girls looked happy they even sang when they were putting their belogings in the trays. Then a fan said we can actually go down to the escalator where the girls will go through because there are no barricades or gates around it. So the fan suddenly became our friend and led us, we took a short cut through an exit door and came out at some stairs and through another door. Next thing we know, we are at the lower floor. There were quite a lof fans already there and as we get in the crowd, soshi were making their way down the escalator. My friend wanted to have a better look. We screamed Yuri! Yuri! and started moving forward because everyone was doing so. We were focusing on Yuri and then we heard a fan shout ""HEY!!!"" and then a girl screamed. We heard a loud bang llike on a metal bar or something. Then everyone started screaming ""Jessica"" and we could hear the managers and staff calling each other. The other Soshi members ran towards us but we were pushed aside by a male staff wearing blue. Between other fans we could see Jessica's body on the ground and she didn't move for a couple of seconds. Then Yuri, Yoona and Sunny came from behind me and started calling Jessica. Sooyoung was really shocked she kept putting her hands on her mouth. After Jessica was lifted up by one of the manager, Yoona and Yuri started crying but no one said anything. We don't know where the person who pushed Jess because he was gone after the chaos. We saw Jess leaning towards theanager but she didn't even walk properly. After they were gone, we started asking people what happened and they said the security thought Jess was someone who was blocking the way.. They said some other things but in Chinese I can't understand.

Summary from /u/Ciryandor:

[Original News Article](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2013/11/breaking-nsfw-purported-nude-photos-of-ailee-leaked) by AllKPop with edited pictures on the article. Claims of these pictures being found on anonib and tumblr were made on the article.

[Initial reactions](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2013/11/ailee.html) to this revelation were outrage at AKP for releasing the post and at the leaker of the posts, who was presumed to be her ex-boyfriend.

[Further revelations](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2013/11/dispatch-releases-transcription-of.html) showed that it was indeed her ex-boyfriend who was at fault for attempting to distribute the photographs to other news sites, while Ailee's promotion cycle for her first album in Japan has been thrown into disarray over the furor.

With the controversy continuing to spiral out of control, a [PR release](http://m.enewsworld.interest.me/news/news_view.asp?nsID=50401)  explaining how the pictures were acquired and that legal action would be pursued against those who did so was released by YMC Entertainment.

The revelation that [Ailee's ex-boyfriend](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2013/11/ailees-reps-confirm-pictures-to-be-her.htm) worked in 6theory Media, the company behind the site that initially broke the scandal made it even more likely that YMC Entertainment would pursue charges against them.

In light of recent events, we felt a clarification on YMC Entertainment's accusations against Daniel Lee and allkpop were necessary.

Back in June 28, 2013 an individual claiming to be from Canada sent in a tip to us that he had a ""set of Ailee Nude Scandal Pictures"" and that he would sell them to us [allkpop] for the right offer.

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/ZibV3op.jpg)

We responded to the email stating that we would prefer to talk over the phone. Over the phone conversation, this person stated that he would like to ""sell us the photos"" and ""break the story"". At the time he stated he didn't have access to Sports Seoul or Dispatch but he would be willing to contact them if we didn't break the story. The person in question stated that he was a person acting as a middleman between the original owner and sent us a sample photo ""for proof"". He wanted to meet at an undisclosed location where he would provide us all the photos in exchange of $3500 USD in Cash.


At this time, we stated that we were not interested, and this person said he would contact another agency.


As we had good relations with Ailee, we informed our contact at YMC Entertainment that someone had contacted us stating that they had nude photos of Ailee. We stated we saw it and it was most likely her, even sending the sample photo. We informed them that if they were to pursue legal action, we would be bound to provide the contact information of the informant. They replied that we were most likely making everything up and brushed it off. We were bewildered why they would brush this off, when we were offering assistance.

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/YGJpeoV.jpg)


For Ailee's sake, we stated to YMC that we would not write anything about this unless the photos were to end up being posted on the internet. We very clearly stated that if the photos were to show up online we would have to write the story as that is our job and duty as a news site.


On November 10, we received the following tip to a forum post on anonib:

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/r9zb0X2.jpg)

The tip came from what we believe is the same informant that originally contacted us in June, as both IP addresses are from the same ISP in Toronto, Canada. At this point, the photos were on the internet and we made the decision to run the story, as it is our policy to report on the truth. For full disclosure, our employee, Daniel Lee did date Ailee in the past, however he did not post the photos in question. Not knowing who the true culprit was, YMC turned the blame to the easiest target. Common sense should also tell you that you do not send in nude photos for underwear modeling. Although Ailee is a victim, so is Daniel Lee, as false allegations were made by YMC, defaming our employee. In conclusion, we have saved all email correspondences from the individual who sent us the initial email. If legally requested by YMC, we will provide all information to the proper authorities, to ensure that the truth of the matter is revealed. We truly hope that YMC decides to run a full legal investigation, as it will reveal the whole truth of the situation.

 ===== 
 YMC Entertainment's Official Statement: 


Hello. This is YMC Entertainment.

In relation to the controversial pictures of Ailee before her debut, we will be revealing the information that has been confirmed. We hope you will understand that it took us a long time to check the information in order to tell you the more accurate truth.   (content)  . (Party)             (understanding).

While Ailee was a resident in America, she received a casting offer to be a famous underwear model in America. The relevant picture has been confirmed to be a picture taken on the pretext of testing the cameras. Among the pictures revealed on the anonymous website, a portion was still unclear during our investigation so we are continuing to investigate them.     (residence)       (offer) , (camera testing) (on the pretext)   , (anonymous)      (portion)  (uncertain)      .

In relation to the leaked pictures, Ailee had been told that in order to accurately judge her body figure, she had to participate in a nude shoot. Because it was a test to be a famous underwear model, Ailee believed her personal information would be protected and complied.  (leaked)    (accurately)     ,     (personal information) (protect)    .

However, after the test shoot finished, the party who had first made the offer stopped all contact so that the concerned Ailee made a decision and reported it to the nearby police station.           (stopped),    (concluded)    .

After the police looked into it, it was becoming clear that the involved party was committing fraud while targeting female students in a portion of the university's town. There appeared to be a couple of victims besides Ailee, but due to the fraudulent party's clever method of using the internet, the police were unable to smoothly investigate and make any arrests.    (part of university town)    (commit a fraud)   (the party's act) (becoming clear),          (tactful/clever) (means)    (smoothly)     (arrest)   .

After reporting to the police, Ailee, who felt deeply worried and uneasy, visited her previous boyfriend who was working at All KPop, and told him everything and consulted him about what happened. While consulting the previous boyfriend, who should have fully grasped and handled the information about these pictures, Ailee was persuaded by him to send him the pictures from the shoot.         ALL KPOP (in-service)        (consulted) ,      (grasp/understanding) (handle)   (persuasion)       .

The above information is all the true information in relation to the leaked pictures. (leaked)    (above)  , .

We will be taking strong legal action in relation to the person who disregarded protection of personal information and illegally circulated the pictures in question. (party)   (circulator) (personal)(protection law)(privacy safeguards)  (illegal circulation)      .

In addition, we will be doing our best so that Ailee will no longer be tormented by suspicion and gossip.    (doubt/suspicion) (gossip/be the talk of)          .

Although it was an act deriving from lack of thought and maturity, it was not derived from wrong intentions or actions and it is becoming a large source of pain for Ailee, who had been living her life as a woman before she became a singer, as well as Ailee's family.       (wrong/mistaken) (intention)    ,         ,   (handle/manage)   .

The relevant pictures had been a painful memory that had been largely traumatic and deeply hurtful for Ailee.           .

We fear that Ailee may once again receive a large wound from the hurtful memory when she had forgotten the painful past and had been looking towards her dreams.    ,                 (feared/worried).

We hope for warm consolation and encouragement so that Ailee will not experience more pain and can continue her activities diligently.            (console/comfort) (encouragement) .

I was really shocked, and what made it more shocking was that it was #6 on [YouTube's Kpop Music Chart](http://www.youtube.com/kpop) beating out a lot of big groups/popular songs.

Not that I'm complaining because I do really love the song and Fiestar. But I'm kinda astonished that it was that high on the list for being a relatively smaller group/ But I just wanna know how this actually happened or it was just that the song began picking up popularity for whatever reason.

Holic has met with C-JeS to attempt to make a deal and C-JeS will not be holding back.

Hello.
This is C-JeS Entertainment.

Today, the person who was responsible for spreading malicious rumors and false information about the members of JYJ on DC Gallery under the ID Holic came to our offices to give her apologies. The parents of Holic asked us to take into consideration the fact that she is a minor and requested for favorable arrangements to be made, but we have rejected their requests. Our compensation for damages lawsuit will continue on as planned, and as we have stated before, this company will not engage in any favorable arrangements or consultations with malicious netizens.

Not only are we dealing with the recently surging spread of malicious rumors and false information about the members of JYJ, but we are also investigating all slanderous and abusive comments that are guilty of contempt with the help of the Cyber Terror Response Centers intelligence team.

We will continue to post notices on these cases as they develop, and we would like to send a warning to those spreading malicious slander and false rumors to others.
Thank you.

&gt; She is currently staying and promoting in Japan, but she plans to reenter Korea on the 13th or 14th and is planning to follow her original schedule while continuing investigation into her recent scandal.
 
&gt; **After consulting the law on November 12, YMC Entertainment decided to focus on tracking down the American circulator as soon as possible**.  They are in the process of examining the legal action in relation to the second round of circulation in their own country.
 
&gt; Also, in relation to their explanation that the pictures were caused by a fraudulent lingerie modeling agency, people are raising doubts on whether there is truth to this claim and so the agency may pursue the course of revealing relevant documents and other proof.
 
&gt; Regardless, you will be able to see Ailee at the music awards, which will take place on November 14 at the Seoul Olympic Park's gymnastics stadium, as well as at other events in the singer's original schedule.

Didn't they claim the IP came from Canada before? Now they're tracking down the American huh? Interesting.

&gt; An anonymous website and forums has uploaded several photos potentially depicting allkpop CEO Johnny Noh in revealing attire. 
&gt; 
&gt; While the photos are blurry, there is a definite correlation between the CEO and the man in the photos. 
&gt; 
&gt; **At this point, the photos were on the internet and we made the decision to run the story, as it is our policy to report on the truth.**

Backstory: [This guy](https://twitter.com/cashboxman) has been spreading rumors about Jaejoong and JYJ returning to an S.M. subsidiary for months. Jaejoong and XIA have told him before to shut his mouth. He is a CEO for a Japanese label [HERE](http://emusic.co.jp/) JYJ have had issues in Japan but this man somehow has leaked information about the group on several occasions that were true. Although it seems Jaejoong is getting tired of his actions.

Good Guy /u/_SNSD_fan 

&gt;Trans: How does it feel like to run away after I tried to kick you out when you entered the auditorium? You cheapskate, just quit everything and become an actor. Because of you, many innocent people have had their minds disturbed. I can't stand seeing that, so unless you want to go into custody, you should stop.

SO [HERE](http://gyazo.com/62d5f6e81b0b5cd9ab110ffbd2385549) is the image in case of deletion.

Looks like Jaejoong found the guy and removed him from entering his concert. ",15,18

I will not be able to do M!Countdown or Music Bank posts here or on Koreaboo for the next 3-4 weeks. Combination of loads of school work, work and just being generally awesome has caught up with me and I'm way too busy to do anything else for rest of this month and mid December. I have 6 assignments to do for the first week of December alone, so got to take a break away from kpop for a bit.

If anyone else would like to take over for the next 3-4 weeks I'd be very grateful, I can give you my regular youtube channels + post format. Otherwise y'all might need to use another site for your music show fix for the mean time. 

I might still do a post on MAMA, because MAMA.

It's nearing years end and (forgive me if I'm wrong) but I haven't seen a discussion post on this recently. With the vast majority of releases for 2013 already under our belt, what's been your favourite release this year and why?

For me personally, I really loved [**Philtre ft. Younha - Fade**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMqvpSjhmqI). I feel like it really shakes up the standard Korean ballad style and I'm really into ambient electronic backers, so coupled with Younha's great voice this song was a winner for me.

**EDIT:** Some updated favourites now I'm back from uni:

* [**Ailee ft. Yiruma** - Higher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nz4N_JqimA) - Yiruma's composing goes so freaking well with Ailee's vocals, it's different in style from her mini album she released this year. In my opinion it's less fierce but more 'focused' I guess - the backing music is synth-heavy and less punchy in favour of really letting her vocals shine!

* [**Clazziquai Project** - Like a Diamond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtP3Utb10sQ) - It was really hard for me to pick a favourite from Clazziquai's latest *Blessed* album, but I think this is it. I love Alex and Horan's vocal synergy and I think this style of electronic track really shows it off well. 

* [**Dynamic Duo ft. Hyorin** - Hot Wings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEdMoX9IzwA) - I've been a Sistar fan for a long time and really love Hyorin's vocals, so when I was being introduced to Korean rap I fell in love with this collab. It's classy and fast-paced and combines DD's rapping skills and Hyorin's vocals nicely IMO.

* [**Epik High** - 420](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nz4N_JqimA) - I got into Korean hip hop proper only in the last few months but I've been working through Epik High's back catalog and this track really harks back to the material they produced in 2009 and before.

* [**Lim Kim** - Urban Green [English Ver.]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdLFoPIjEg) - I think the English version of this track is really refreshing, and stylistically I love it. Lim Kim's voice is incredibly calming and works really well with an acoustic guitar to back it.

* [**Miss A** - Hush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp0F18FFCTE) - Honestly when I first heard this track I was a little disappointed, from the teaser I really expected a dark-themed track (something not too common in female group releases atm) and the actual song was different from my expectations. However, after listening to it a few times I came to love it, I love the refreshing simplicity of the instrumental track.

* [**Soyou ft. Mad Clown** - Stupid in Love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q9wRP8YHDg) - This track got me into Mad Clown, I absolutely love his extended rap segments.

* [**Younha** - Fireworks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKihko_ZipY) - I love The Koxx and Younha, so naturally their collab track is my favourite of the *Just Listen* EP. Younha's voice fits so perfectly with the indie rock-style electric guitar and the song is incredibly catchy.

737,2013-11-26,2013,11,26,14,1rh4i0,Woollim admits INFINITE's L dating rumors were real; girlfriend to start a lawsuit against hate comments,dazzlingboy,1385442178,"Kim Do Yeon tweeted today, ""After the dating rumors, I did not explain myself due to Woollim's request, but now it has come to this point because I can no longer keep silent with amount of physical and mental damage I have received. I will be filing lawsuits against hate comments"", along with an image file of the full statement she has written to express her thoughts about her situation.
 
In the image file of her full statement, Kim Do Yeon mentions the immense backlash she's received from INFINITE fans, why she kept silent until now, as well as why she can no longer keep her silence.
 
She starts off, ""I can't sit around any longer watching the damage so I kept patient and patient and belatedly uploaded a post. Starting from when the dating scandal came out up until now, his agency asked me to stay quiet for Myung Soo's sake so I kept silent. I thought that was best for him and that I would be able to hold it in well. Through this incident, those fans would throw rocks at me on my way home from work and take out the gas from my car, and even if when there were happenings like that, I didn't press charges. I would come home and lie to my parents that my face is puffy because I accidentally bumped into something to assure them. I waited for things to become quiet but they became more violent and threw trash in front of my agency headquarters. The level of their actions became gradually worse as they disrupted the sales of our shopping mall by buying in bulk and then returning everything. In the end, my parents who have been sick recently fainted and were admitted into the hospital and said that it was very sad to see their daughter, who they raised and event sent overseas for study, hurt because of this. Upon seeing my mother crying, although it's late, to protect one person, I think I wasn't able to protect the ones I love and myself so I plan to reveal everything.""
 
She also mentions, ""Although we can be criticized for dating so freely and not recognizing the characteristic of the other person's career, I do not think that I have done wrong to the point that I'm cursed at and threatened to be killed, and all my information is revealed on the internet, and even end up causing harm to someone else just because they had the same name as me on their graduation photo.""
 
Kim Do Yeon also points out that fans acting out this way will only further bring harm to L and his group members and that she will no longer tolerate any form of hate.
 
With her tweets spreading like wildfire, Woollim, who previously said that L and Kim Do Yeon were just friends, seems to have changed their position on the matter.
 
A rep from Woollim told Newsen, ""It's true that L and Kim Do Yeon dated."" Another rep revealed that they plan to release an official statement regarding the matter soon, so stay tuned.

5. [+625, -7] What are people feeling sorry to L for, it's the rest of his members you should be feeling sorry for 

6. [+624, -6] All because he couldn't manage his private life, why do his members have to suffer the consequences for it?

7. [+572, -4] L lost both his fans and his girlfriend...

1. [+1,011, -108] She set all this up herself so what is she causing such a fuss about?  Hateful commenters are certainly an issue but I don't think this woman is sane at all... I don't care whether this dating rumor is true or not but I am tired of articles about it

2. [+805, -39] Hateful commenters should be reprimanded. But I don't particularly care whether you two are dating or not 

3. [+473, -54] Who is this b*tch and why is she acting up? No one cares whether you're dating L or not so shut up and go eat your chocolate or something

I couldn't find anything about the show on through the search function, and figured it some of you guys might be interested in watching either s1 or s2, as it really shows a different side of the idols involved.

The basic premise is they invite 13 smart people, idols/comedians/poker players/whatever, and make them compete in logic based games, with plenty of room for alliances and betrayal, and one person goes home each episode. The first season notably had Infinite's sunggyu, Roo'ra's Sangmin (and for any starcraft fans out there, old school zerg Yellow/Hong Jinho :D).

It was one of the most entertaining shows I've watched in a LONG time, all episodes from season 1 are subbed on [youtube here](http://www.youtube.com/user/Bumdidlyumptious), with the [first episode here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhA-Un__VHM) for anyone interested, (If links to subbed k-shows aren't allowed here just let me know and i'll take it down, the rules were vague on that)",6,22

811,2013-11-29,2013,11,29,1,1rngg4,[News] DSP finally confirms Nicole is leaving KARA,[deleted],1385654761,"Popular girl group Kara is coming to an end in January, at least in its current five-member configuration. After weeks of speculation, **the groups agency DSP Media told Ilgan Sports, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily, that Nicole will leave the group after her contract expires in January.**

The agency also said it is preparing to give Nicole a farewell for the groups fans.

Kara released a new EP - French Kiss - and a best-of album in Japan yesterday, but nothing official has been announced for the fans in Korea yet.

Many local music experts expect that the DSP Festival on Dec. 14 at Jamsil Stadium in southeastern Seoul, featuring all the singers affiliated with the agency, could be the last chance to see Kara with the whole lineup.

**Whether the group continues without Nicole is still undecided as another member, Kang Ji-young, also has a contract expiring in April, and she has not said if she wants to remain with the agency.**

Officials in the music industry are saying the groups future will likely hinge on Kangs decision. **Many think that Kara could withstand losing one member, but two may be a deathblow.**

The Baddest Female feels like a vanity project gone completely wrong. From the godawful lyrics to the MV's obvious and almost shameless ripping off of vibes of both Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, it really goes to show that if and when CL ever goes solo....she better improve, because coasting on supposed ""fierceness"" and charisma won't take you anywhere.

Hurricane on the other hand, is a pretty serviceable song....but then comes the lyrics. As much as the Loof Is On Fiyah line is frggin hilarious, from any other viewpoint, it's a joke. It's not even so bad its good, its bad, period. Similarly, the song feels extremely disjointed, with the chorus being the only thing that seems in the least bit fitting.",128,25
