Lack of proper management and artist promotion goes to DSP media, KARA was in my top five groups and honestly they did not get the attention they received, (Lupin was my jam!!), as most of you know Rainbow just broke up and while I never really listened to their music they also did not get the attention they deserved either. So those are the things I wish would change from the kpop industry.",23,6

&amp;nbsp;
 

These posts have a few aims: 

 

1. To provide the mods a place to feedback what discussions have taken place amongst the mod team that may be relevant to the sub and to get feedback on them. 

2. To get feedback on recent and upcoming changes to the sub. 

3. To give you guys another way to communicate with the mod team! 

&amp;nbsp;
 

If you dont get a response to something raised here right away then please bear with us, it may be that the mods are busy at that time and will get you when they are free or they may have wanted to clarify something with the mod team or another mod.  

&amp;nbsp;

We will be creating an archive of these on the wiki, so if you ever need to refer back you can! 

--- 

 &amp;nbsp;

**Agenda**

1. Music show posts  Feedback and next steps. 

2. Stale topics  Feedback and changes. 

3. Wiki development  Resources/information you would like to see 

4. Use of the sub -  New or Hot? Mod topic archive. 

5. AOB

&amp;nbsp;

    Music show posts 

First on the agenda today is the new music show posts. I think it would be fair to say we know that these arent working as we had hoped, partly due to automod related issues and partly because it just isnt quite right yet! 

&amp;nbsp;

**Firstly, wed like to know how you feel about the performances not being posted individually. Do you prefer this?**

 &amp;nbsp;

Secondly, we would like some feedback for our next steps. A few ideas have been suggested but feel free to suggest your own as well!  

&amp;nbsp;

The first suggestion was that we utilise the r/kpop wiki to set up a page for each show so that assigned users (or some people suggested anyone) could all update it as the videos become available. This should increase the speed at which new videos can be added etc. A post would then be made linking to, or containing the wiki contents. We are still looking at the feasibility of this as there are a number of logistical issues to consider but it would be valuable to know if this (or a variant of) was worth looking at. 

**Particularly, would you still like this idea if the discussion post body just linked to the post, or would that be a click too far?**

&amp;nbsp;

The second suggestion was live threads that allow multiple people to contribute. 

&amp;nbsp;

The third suggestion was we ask for a volunteer from the sub to be the person who manually makes each music show post. Our main concern for this method is that it may mean a delay for people before they can discuss the music show! 

&amp;nbsp;

**As I mentioned above, we welcome all your feedback and suggestions. We said we would trial the new system, we have and its clear some change is needed.**

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

    Stale topics 

 

We introduced stale topics recently to add some clarity to the idea of over familiar content. We envisioned at the time that some topics might remain off the table for a short period of time.  

&amp;nbsp;

Please take a look at the [stale topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/stale-topics), and let us know any general feedback on them. They havent been up long, so I am not proposing any returning this townhall, but feel free to feedback if you think any of them should now be removed at this time. Also please **let us know if there is anything you think needs adding.**

&amp;nbsp;

**We would also like you to let us know how you feel about us including certain sources in the banned list'**. At the moment I think the key area is twitter sources that either dont include a source or include a Korean language source where the only translation is the one line or so on twitter. 

 &amp;nbsp;

    Wiki development 

 

When I applied to be a mod this is something I hoped to be involved in for the sub. All subreddits have the ability to be a wiki. At the moment ours is used for some key things (housing the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules) for example). 

&amp;nbsp;

I personally would like to see it become a resource for the r/kpop community in a bigger way, so Im putting the call out there **What sort of things would you like to see as information/resources for the community?** Feel free to say ""nothing"" - if no one wants anything I shall move on to the next idea :)

&amp;nbsp;
 

    Use of the sub 

This one is a quick question for you all to help inform decisions. **Do you have a strong opinion on whether you want to sort the sub by HOT or by NEW'?**

*Edit for clarity: At the moment we are jsut interested in how people choose to browse the sub, this isn't us proposing a change to the way the sub works. it was raised by some people they miss mod announcements due to the way they browse so we wanted some feedback on how people browse.*

&amp;nbsp;

    AOB 

Any other business? What else would you like to ask, feedback or talk to us about? ",163,75

Full disclosure here: I currently work in K-pop and K-drama and am working on trying to get something going in Australia + NZ! Unfortunately (because I'm an American sitting in America) it's been a bit of a challenge for me to get the word out about what I want to do and talk to some K-Pop Aussie fans about what sites they like to visit, where they hear about K-Pop, what they'd like to see more of etc. I'd love to put it out there to this community to see if anyone could potentially help me in figuring out ways I can market our site to Australian K-Pop fans? 

Thank you!

I'm the creator of [Jombly](http://www.jombly.com) - a visual radio station for top charting k-pop songs. Jombly has been growing and evolving over the last two years and has a fairly large user base now - thousands of unique users every day, many of whom are from /r/kpop.

Initially, I created Jombly because k-pop was really hard to find on the big name radio apps (Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) and music videos were pretty hit-or-miss. The niche Jombly filled was automatically finding and curating those videos along with social media data related to them. As those big-name applications  grow and provide more access to k-pop, Jombly's niche becomes more limited - the others will almost certainly be able to provide comparable music selections. Moving forward, I'd really love some feedback and ideas from the community! What is the k-pop community missing? What service can Jombly provide, if anything?

A few ideas I've heard are:

1. A live chat service along with each video so that users can chat about the videos (think Twitch chat, but for live MVs)

2. A voting system to have songs stick around even after they fall off top charts

3. Change the service to be user-submitted and voted on, much like Reddit - maybe even using Reddit, somehow?

None of this makes me any money, I just love the community and want to help people discover new music! Jombly is, and will always remain, ad-free and free to use.",8,64

So, I'm curious, how many of you actually care about music quality? When I say quality, I mean something like using amp or dac, or using *fancy* headphones, you know, that kind of stuff. I want to know what kind of setup you usually use. Are you satisfied with just iphone + earbud, or do you go full hifi?

I personally used to just use my laptop's speaker. But since I've invested so much in Kpop CDs (and actually listen to them), I thought, ""Well, might as well invest in better equipments."". And now here I am, with my AKG and Concero, I'm satisfied (for now). Oh, and I personally don't have space for speakers, so I got myself a new toy, Waves NX; It's a 3D sound app kind of thing, so I can listen to surround sound with just a headphone. And the difference is big! Well, when I listen to concert DVDs, anyway. For normal CDs (which are usually stereo), the difference is barely there.",61,42

I'm trying to make Spotify's curation for K-Pop more robust and timely, since I think Apple music excels in this regard. Below are a list of mood-based playlists that I update as music is released. All the songs are from the past year and onward. I also update a MelOn Top 100 daily playlist with ""Gayo"" songs only (so no OST takes over the chart). And lastly, A K-Pop UPNEXT playlist which is like B-sides from popular artists as well as lesser known yet rising acts. 

ps. I hope this isn't considered spam, hopefully if any of the Spotify curators for K-pop are in here they can shoot me a message. Would love to join the team. OK BYE

The following article accompanies [this photo](https://s3.postimg.org/f545vbzmr/1478097346.jpg) which has been circulating on social media today.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The prosecution's investigation into Choi Seon-sil's gate has been full-fledged, and the suspicion is likely to spread to the entertainment industry. 

Choi Soon-sil has been directly involved in the Cultural Prosperity Committee, and her nephew Jang Yoo-jin (Jang Seung-hoo, Jang Si-ho) is known to have a close relationship with the entertainment industry.

According to the securities industry and various media on the 1st, Choi is known to be leading the creation culture proliferation policy, which is one of the current government's keynotes, and the representative entertainers participating in the Hallyu policy are being directly targeted by the rumors.

YG Entertainment was sparked by the fact that CEO Yang Min-seok was appointed to the committee of the Cultural Prosperity Commission in July 2013. Yang was the youngest committee member and the only one from entertainment company at that time.

In particular, the CEO Yang also accompanied President Park Geun-hye as an economic delegation for the month before the Committee for Culture and Promotion was selected. From a roster of 71 members, such as the chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo and LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo, CEO Yang is the only one from entertainment companies.

A Blue House official said, ""We did not consider a specific company."" Other entertainment companies, such as SM and JYP, also received the offer, but they couldn't participate, he said.

There are also suspicions surrounding popular stars at the forefront of cultural policy. Big Bang was selected as PR ambassador for the new national brand 'CREATIVE KOREA' last August. However, this brand became the subject of suspicion when it stood at the center of Choi's cultural policy irregularities.

According to one source, 'Creative Korea' was a business with low collusion, but it was adopted as a national brand. In addition, the phrases and colors were similar to the national industrial slogan published by the Trade and Investment Promotion Agency of France. Chae's associate Cha Eun-taek was involved in the business and said that 14 billion won was invested in six fields.

In addition, Choi's nephew Jang Jang, familiar with the top actors and singers, including the status of popular entertainers, government policies and events related to the star continues to be resigned.

The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism denies Choi's involvement in the cultural extension policy. ""It's the first time I have seen the related documents published through the media,"" he said. Some entertainment officials said, ""It was in the past government that a popular entertainer was mobilized in the government event.""

An official from the financial investment industry said, ""YG Entertainment's quarter 3 earnings are expected to be in line with the consensus, and negative factors continue to dampen investor sentiment."" Overall, stock prices at enter-listed companies are likely to rebound for the time being. ""He said.

On the other hand, the prosecution, which is urgently arresting Choi and expanding the investigation, is expanding the investigation into related industries by seizing the real company owned by Chun Eun-taek, an advertising director known as Choi's associate. Mr. Cha is suspected of having been appointed as a member of the Cultural Prosperity Committee in 2014, and as the head of the Creative Economy Promotion, he has taken over the government cultural policy and earned the right.

I occasionally see an article here or there about a specific member, but as far as any group news, nothing. I've seen this before, where a group will do okay, garner decent attention, and then fall off the face of the earth, with no formal disbandment or halt in activities. Why do you think this happens? Is it poor promotion on the companies part? Do I not see things because I'm an international fan? Or are these groups on hiatus? If so, why no formal statement? Why just leave fans in the dark? I get that the kpop market can be very volatile, with hundreds of groups debuting each year, but it still doesn't make much sense to me.",56,60

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

I know Crush is going to the US next so I thought I'd share my experience attending his show in Seoul today. Looooong wall of text and possibly spoilers ahead!

**Arrival at Venue**

I arrived at the venue at around 3:30 since merch sales started at 4pm. Surprisingly no one was there yet (if this was an idol concert people would have been waiting since morning), they only started queuing up at around 3:45, but it was still less than 100 people. Different crowd, I guess. Most people there looked like they were in their 20s. I saw mostly women, but there were many straight couples too. Oddly I didn't see any foreigners. I imagine he's popular among Westerners but I didn't see any.

**Merch Sales**

They were selling 3 merch items: a towel, a key ring and a tag holder. They also gave away free Crush stickers. I always buy a lightstick at concerts, but since there was none I asked for a towel thinking it was like a support towel or like those towels they throw on Show Me The Money, but nope, it was an actual face towel that you have in your bathroom lol. I realised too late that the other two items would have been a much better souvenir. Both the key ring and the tag holder looked very stylish and high quality.

**Before the Show**

People with standing tickets started queuing by section/number at 5:30 and at 6pm we started being taken inside the venue. The stage was simple, there was no catwalk or T stage or anything. In front of the stage were the two standing areas and behind them a few seats, with more seats on the 2nd floor. The venue wasn't too big, it fitted about 2,000 people. The stage was covered by a translucent curtain onto which an image of a hipster living room was projected. We saw the live band come up on stage a few minutes before the start.

**Opening Section**

The show started on time with a VCR (actually a projection on the curtain) showing daytime and nighttime Seoul cityscapes feat. Crush's silhouette and some quotes in English about how all moments, good and bad, are finite. After, the band started playing (they were excellent and really set the mood) and Crush finally came on stage wearing a sparkly golden jacket to sing a bit of 2411 as the intro, after which he sang some older songs, like Red Dress and A Little Bit. The songs had a different feel from what they sound like on the album, since they were all mostly played by the band. It was really refreshing and engaging listening to these versions.

During his ment, Crush said he was nervous but it honestly didn't look like it. His singing was on point 100% of the time and he really looked like he was enjoying himself, often interacting with the audience and acting cute when he was talking.

By the second part of this section the sound got a little livelier, like salsa. He sang the first part of Friday, followed by - I kid you not - his McDonald's song (he sang a jingle for them here in Korea, you see it a lot on TV). The section ended with images of Ronald McDonald and french fries projected onto the curtain. Seriously. I was bummed that the McDonald's song was longer than Friday, I didn't go there to watch a commercial lol.

**Jazzy Section and Dean**

Another VCR of cityscapes and Crush silhouettes. The second section started with only part of the curtain open, creating a dark and moody atmosphere. On stage was Crush wearing a set of loose fit trousers and a dark turtleneck and blazer. Accompanying him was a piano, guitar and later a bass. He sang  , a slow English song I didn't recognize, then the stage opened up as he performed a jazzy balad version of Sofa. Musically, this part was the best imo, my ears were in heaven for those few minutes. At some point I closed my eyes and just listened to the band, it was delightful.

Suddenly without any warning Crush was gone and Dean came on stage! He performed D and I'm Not Sorry, the original versions. The audience went nuts for him and he bathed in the attention. Crush pretended to be jealous after coming back on stage and demanded we pay attention to him instead.

**Final Section feat. More Guests**

Crush wore black jeans and tshirt with a red jacket for the final section. As this was the end he said he wanted us to party hard. And boy did we party. He kicked it off with a lively version of Hug Me which had everyone jumping up and down. Then, just when we thought things couldn't get better, Zico was on stage! He performed a bit of a song I'm not familiar with and then  Yes Or No, joined by Dean and Penomeco. Crush joined them afterwards and they all performed Oasis. This part had everyone chanting along and was super fun.

**Encore and Feels**

The last song hadn't even finished and everyone was already shouting for an encore. Sure enough, after a while the sounds of the live piano started to fill the room and Crush appeared on stage to sing . He talked to us about how that song was very meaningful to him and how he was thankful for the fans' support whenever he's going through tough times.

The last song, he said, is the one that means the most to him. He started to sing , but in the middle of it he couldn't hold it in anymore and started to cry. He turned the mic to the audience instead and let us sing the rest of the song while he tried to compose himself. Tons of white confetti started to fall and the show ended on this emotional note, with Crush still in tears bowing to the audience several times and finally leaving the stage.

**Final Thoughts**

The show went on for a little over two hours and I enjoyed every moment. Not only was Crush's singing and rapping top notch, the live band was amazing and the stage, lights etc. were always super professional and tasteful. You can tell a lot of work and preparation went into this tour. I'm dead tired but I'm going home with wonderful memories of the show and the satisfaction of having attended such a high-quality performance by an artist I now admire even more.

And sorry for the super long account. I hope this was at least a little interesting for those going to other dates of his tour.",9,28

393,2016-11-5,2016,11,5,23,5ba8a5,"[DISCUSSION] For those of you who have see your favorites live in concert, what surprised you the most?",itskarlay,1478357371,"GOT7's Fly in Chicago this past summer was my first kpop concert. GOT7 is my favorite group so my expectations were already high, but I left the show with a much deeper appreciation for them (as if I needed to be any more obsessed). There were quite a few things about that night that left me surprised (in a good way).

1. How live it actually was. With it being kpop, I guess I was expecting quite a bit of reliance on back tracks, but there really wasn't any point in the show where I was like ""oh they're lip syncing"" and I really loved that! (Youngjae did rely on backtracks for a number of songs, but I don't really count that against him because it was his first night back after being hospitalized and he was still clearly very sick.)

2. How long it was! Every time they went back to change clothes I just kept thinking ""Ok, this has to be the last part,"" but it just kept going! It was a little over three hours and probably one of the longest concerts I've been to. It made the money I dropped on my ticket seem much more worth it.

3. How much they talked. They spent like 10 minute breaks between numbers just talking which is definitely something I wasn't used to from any other concert I've been to. I don't know if it's normal in kpop concerts, but I loved it. 

4. Seeing them in person up close when they came into the crowd and again later at the hi touch, I was surprised. I knew they were all amazingly gorgeous, but I don't think you could ever be prepared for how beautiful your favorite group is in real life up close. Mark basically glowed while the hallelujah chorus was playing behind him. Also, you hear a lot about companies faking the heights on their profiles and adding an inch or two so I was expecting them to be shorter, I was very surprised to see their heights seemed to be close to what is there (not that it matters or I would love them less, just a surprise).

SO, I'm wondering what your experiences have been like. What did you go in expecting from your favorite group's concert and how did you feel about those expectations when it was over? 

Edit: I wish I could fix the title because of the typo. I meant ""seen."" This is going to bother me all day. ",139,131

------------
Just some info, the 3rd Mini Album, Kratos came with a special paper that requires to be cut to make the Hologram pyramid (the cover art for Kratos is the evil eye!) VIXX will be releasing more videos on their YouTube channel RealVIXX. VIXX is also the first K-Pop group to use the Hologram pyramid as part of their promotions.

Leo demonstrates how the Hologram pyramid works in  [this video](https://instagram.com/p/BMQgZVogGdJ/). 

So far member messages and individual performances of The Closer have been released. 

If you want to view the videos [here is how you make your own hologram pyramid](http://youtu.be/9t0cOYvOy4M) ^(thank ^you ^to ^/u/abzka!). However this shouldn't be seen as an alternative to buying the album, please support VIXX if you can!

What I mean is that I was attracted to Kpop and enjoy kpop because of the creativity and uniqueness of the musicians, I was also interested because the musicians themselves are very passionate about many things (art, music, fashion ...etc.) and it's enjoyable to see but I've also had bad experiences because of Kpop. What I mean is that I found a specific kpop idol (G-Dragon) and became extremely interested in him because of the way he looks, dresses, acts, styles and interests. I had never really been into celebrities because I didn't find them interesting, but G-Dragon was different!, I found everything he did was awesome and unique and I loved it and it didn't take long until I wanted to be exactly like him. But after a period of time I realised I was the furthest thing from G-Dragon and that sent me down a spiral of long term depression and suicidal thoughts. I became disgusted with my own appearance and hated looking in anything that reflected my own face or even having any photos taken of myself, I hated how I looked!. Whilst some of these effects are still with me I feel like I am better than I was a year or two ago but kpop has definitely had a negative effect on my life.

Has Kpop effected anybody else in a negative way or caused negative effects to their life?, I would be interested in hearing about it!

My two cents: It's a great album and also very cohesive. It's one of those albums that I'd play the entire album on repeat - not just the select few songs. As cheesy as it sounds, all of the songs are my favourite. I find that the line distribution for the songs to be much better than the single album Put 'Em Up.",16,74

525,2016-11-7,2016,11,7,20,5blnvh,[Discussion] How has Kpop changed your way of thinking?,pointless10,1478518254,"Hello, I saw a post in r/AsianBeauty that made me really think! How has kpop changed the way that you think of things, either good or bad effects? For example, do you find yourself thinking about people's proportions? Or have idols become a motivator for you? Do you view plastic surgery differently? I'm super interested to hear about any sort of small changes you guys have noticed about yourselves!

--------------------------------------
As for me, I'm Asian myself so Kpop hasn't really completely done a 180 for me, but I definitely lean more towards a lot of things because of it since I was introduced to it while I was in my formative teen years. 
The bad
* So freaking aware of proportions and head size - I have a huge head/face and I never even noticed it before kpop :(
* Likewise I'm more aware that I'm chubby, (but this actually motivates me to exercise more and eat healthier, so not totally negative)
* I find Asian guys are more attractive. I still find non-Asian guys handsome, but I have noticed somehow that I don't get as heart fluttery :( I feel very sorry to multiculturalism :(

I'll end with the good things!
* I was originally pale because I hate the feeling of the sun on a hot day, but I've come to really like my complexion because of kpop. I just feel like my skin colour matches so well with all sorts of colours, and I love colourful clothes. 
* I feel like kpop influences me to be more filial! Idols actually get teary and cry when talking about their parents, many of them give their first paycheck to their parents and buy them houses and cars. I also try not to argue with my parents as much. 
* They motivate me to study and work harder! Their behind the scenes videos also cheer me up at the end of a bad day :D
* Kpop has expanded my taste in music funnily enough, and I appreciate rapping now (I used to hate all forms of it, but now my UB is Suga from BTS!) It has also made me appreciate music as a whole and how music can have a healing effect on the soul :3",105,73

Also ballads vs pop?,YESthisisnttaken,1478571312,"Hi so as a Red Velvet fan I obviously checked the charts when RR was promoting and I noticed that two very popular singers were dominating the charts. This left me wondering if ""regular"" singers in Korea are that popular compared to K-Pop groups and what exactly differentiates them from ""Kpop"". 

Also, these singers usually sing ballad-ish songs. Ailee, Han Dong Geun, and K-Will often sing slower songs that resemble OSTs. I thought ballads weren't popular in Korea? I probably am just too ignorant due stereotyping One of These Nights of off the entire library of ballads in Korea but that's why I asked. I brought this up because I am currently listeing to a ballad playlist, and Amazing You, Ailee, and Big Mama are just so incredible

Also, I'd like to point out that Narsha's - I'm in Love features awesome lyrics including:

&gt;I thought I was never gonna fall in love,but I'm in love,because I wanna love you baby.

Haha, Awesome song though",31,18

MY EXPERIENCE: 
&gt;I stanned K-POP since 2012 but I became a more avid fan during 2014. Stanning K-POP was a roller coaster ride since before I mostly listened to Hip-Hop, Rap, R&amp;B as I did not want to be outcasted in the social norm, but I was like screw it. When i watched the first video of Youtubers React to KPOP, I watched the videos that was included in it. I got bored so I watched the related KPOP videos which led me to what I am today  Stanning more than 50 KPOP Groups, watching their MV, listening to their albums (6 GB KPOP - would have been more if my storage wasn't limited ). **However, there was a moment of Epiphany as I stan KPOP... As i stan more KPOP (popular and nugu) groups, my grades starts to flunctuate. I still have insecurities and blame myself everyday for not being good-looking like them and unable to reach their levels of talent. KPOP provided me with happiness but with sadness at same time which is ironic. Then, i have to admit that my level of addiction in KPOP and the Korean Dramas, Culture, etc. Itself is unhealthy. Stanning KPOP for 4 years made me realize that I eventually have to accept reality where I can't be as devoted as I want to be in the future since I need to get my priorities straight which is basically education and a job. This also made me jealous about the fact that people who lives in Korea can enjoy and be devoted to their idols since they reside there whereas I live in the other side of the world.**",17,13

What I mean is for example, rappers are stereotypically poor vocalists and well vice versa. Example: Hwasa is a rapper but can sing quite well getting regularly more vocally taxing verses compared to those usually given to non-vocalists.

Or how for example visual members are there solely for looks or acting potential, so are weak in the dance or singing departments. Exception: Jungkook who sings most lines and is at least on par with one of the main dancers, J-Hope and Jimin.

Or how vocalists are stereotypically the less talented members in dance and vice versa. Main dancers usually are weak vocalists. So for example Rose who so far has shown great dancing prowess as a vocalist from their dance practices.

Any more similar to these?

Edit: Lets try to be objective while talking about our biases though haha. For the discussion's sake, ty!

Whenever an AKP(allkpop) article is shared there is always a comment under that post that details exactly what the article says because no one wants to give them traffic. I understand why there is such a strong dislike for the site but what I don't understand is why we continue to share their articles then? Soompi (I don't really know any other kpop news site) posts the same articles in a more tasteful manner, imo. Wouldn't it make more sense to post articles from other sites instead of one you don't want to support? I hope this question doesn't bother anyone, it's just something I've been curious about.",28,73

Here are the highlights from my 2-day concerts experience, feel free to ask me about my experience if you're interested :)

Day 1: A Meu that I met for the first time ever kindly gave me the extra pass for the m&amp;g session post concert!!!

50 of us were led to the meeting area, just a small room sectioned off with tables at the side where we had to leave our bags and phones - there was strictly no recording, no gifts/letters, and no high touch, else they would cancel the m&amp;g session entirely, all of these instructed very clearly in 3 different languages (Japanese, Korean, English). We were lined up in rows of ten, all semi-silently freaking out, breathing out to calm the nerves, some were squealing, some thinking of what they should say to the girls, some looking at their friends in disbelief as we waited, staring at the screen that was shielding the entrance where Amber, Krystal, Luna and Victoria would enter from shortly. I was in the 3rd row, just 2 metres shy from behind a table f(x) would later stand to give out their individual postcards (yes i will be buying frames to frame them all up!!) There was a collective gasp followed up by some shrieks and clapping to welcome the girls, Amber, followed by Krystal, Luna and Victoria emerged from behind the screens - and that would be the order of the m&amp;g. 

Holy fuck they were gorgeous. sure, they looked a little tired and had the post-performance sheen, but still ethereal. They were all smiles when they entered, Amber waving to us with both hands like old friends, Krystal looked a bit shy and scanning us lolol, Luna's smile brightened the entire room, Victoria just smiled and waved at us so elegantly like the queen she is. The order from my left to right: V, L, K, A. There was just a brief moment of silence before they greeted us in Korean (which is a complete blank in my memory due to lack of understanding and pure elation of standing within 2m of my one and only idol group) and i could just feel everyone's eyes concentrating on the four of them, just to bask in the gloriousness of the situation. It may sound like f(x) is very out of reach/godlike idol/ statues in glass casing, but I genuinely felt comfortable in their presence...they were warm people who appreciate the love from their fans. Before VLKA greeted us, the staff members allowed us to move slightly closer to the table, and all 4 of them sweetly gestured at us to move closer to them ^^ They greeted as f(x) before individually talking to us; my keen sense of inference tells me that they probably asked hows the concert/is everyone feeling okay/hows the new single etc. After they were done, we were ushered row by row to receive the postcards from the girls, and we were allowed to give a short greeting which i had of course prepared...execution wise...sigh.

So Amber first, like I practiced in my mind: ""Hey Amber, Go Team Llama!"" complete with fist pumping. And she replied, ""Oh hey, yeah, Go Team Llama!"" complete with first pumping right back at me. It was comfortable, just like hanging out with an old friend you've havent seen in a while. Took my postcard, thanked her, moved on to Krystal. 

Krystal...this one got a little bit difficult, she had an aura. ""Hey...you were amazing today..."" She did a double take on me coz I greeted her in English, and she smiled and cooly said, ""oh...thanks"" while handing me her postcard. I felt like i couldnt really look her in the face which is a goddamn pity because she is beautiful.

Luna. Oh. My. God. This is the single biggest regret of my life. She was all energetic and smiley to everyone, and the first goddamn word I said to my girl was ""Soojung"". SOOJUNG. Krystal's fucking name. I froze, literally facepalming and her cute laughter at my blunder did not help me recall what I had planned to say. The ushers were already trying to move me on to Vic, so Luna extended her postcard towards me and I manage to choke out a ""Luna's Alphabet fighting..."" I don't even know if she heard me. I'M SORRY SUNYOUNG I LOVE YOU.

So I was ushered onto Vic right now, since I speak mandarin as well, I really wanted to tell her to take care of her health. But between the ushering and my slight mental breakdown in front of Luna, all I could say was ""Thank you, big sis SongQian"" as Vic gave me her postcard.

As I shuffled back in line while the remaining crowd had their turn, I didn't even take a look at the postcards they gave out, I just wanted to have a few more glimpses of the girls while they were in front of my eyes. It all went by too quickly. They did their final greeting, said their ""see you soon/tomorrow"" and waved us all goodbye and exited back behind the screen. All of us took a collective breath together, a snap back to reality, wondering if this whole encounter with our idols did truly happen. 

Day 2 concert was even more hyped then the first night; bigger turnout, crowd more pumped (by Japanese standard), I had better seats compared to the day before, I had a crazy friend beside me ready to party...it was perfect. I won't be going into concert details, just a small recount of my interaction with Luna during the set. My seat was right at the back of the centre portion, which is right in front of the mini stage where f(x) would perform Airplane, Jet and Beautiful Stranger in front of the audience at the back of the arena. Luna and Amber always gets super hyped at this part of the concert and would go around running their hands through the outstretched hands of their fans. So this time I was really lucky to have Luna running down my section during Beautiful Stranger. She touched hands with me and in that moment when she was just about to move away from me I yelled, ""LUNA SARANGHAE"". And she heard me. Luna turned back...she smiled that smile that would light up the entire arenaand made a finger heart at me.

I think I've been forgiven.

Whew okay, I actually meant this as a Friday FFA response but it got way too long. So yup gonna make this a post instead. Thanks for reading y'all!

TL;DR: Day 1, fucked up in front of Luna. Day 2, was forgiven by Luna.",14,111

So I've been keeping track of every artist that debuted this year and I thought it would be a good idea to share the list with you all. I hope this helps you find new music that fits your taste. Some small things that I would like to note: this list does not contain soloists or subunits of currently established groups(ex. Luna, Free Somebody); Most pictures will show only the current line-ups of the groups. I will be adding more of these in the next few weeks, all the way until the December releases, then I will restart for 2017. Also, if there are any artists who did not have a music video when they debuted, I will be including them here as special mentions. I tried to gather all of the debuts, but if I leave any out please let me know.


Ill be listing each artist in alphabetical order and depending on how much I know about the artists I will provide a general rundown of facts about their releases and the members if possible. 


Note: If anybody wants Facebook/Twitter/Instagram information about any of the artists, PM me and Ill send you what I have. I follow most of them on Instagram and I have a lot of Facebooks and Twitter accounts listed so it shouldnt be too hard.

 
**Female Artists**

 
[A.Some, Group] (http://imgur.com/TxaOMbL)


*Company:* The Solution Music


*Concept:* Crossover pop


*Members:* Yoonkyung, Serim(aka Jessica Lee), Eunji, Hyunju, Mina, Mikyung(formerly)


A.Some is a crossover pop group. Their first single, [Temptress] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyz1SxHNyNQ), was an upbeat dance track combining the groups musical abilities with electronic music. Their second single, [Dont Take My Hand] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLk7wc5AIzE), is a soft ballad that shows off the talent of the vocalists.


 
[CocoSori, Duo] (http://imgur.com/FIxe3dz)


*Company:* Mole Entertainment


*Concept:* Wacky, Twin Cosplay


*Members:* Coco, Sori


CocoSori debuted this year with broccoli-laden music video, [Dark Circle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4SGYjRPx1g). They garnered attention for having a similar concept to Orange Caramel. Their second single, [Exquisite] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHttanRj6VU), gathered the duo even more fans and features a giant cat screaming Annyoung! They released their first Japanese single, Mermaid in August. Coco is Korean-American and is a former member of girl group Blady. Sori has lived in Japan and is currently participating in Idolmaster Korea.



 
[Eia, soloist] (http://imgur.com/hMgv0x2)


*Company:* Ego Entertainment


*Genre:* R&amp;B


Eia debuted with [Spoon Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2qtpB0ISp0) and is on my personal list of most underrated soloists to debut this year. Her voice is a perfect balance between soft and strong. Hopefully, she will be able to break into the K-R&amp;B music scene with future releases.




 
[Hi.D, group] (http://imgur.com/i3Am5N0)


*Company:* Heroes Factory


*Concept:* Sexy, Girl Crush


*Members:* Edge, Bonny, Seyeon, Hayang


Four-membered girl group Hi.D(short for High Lady) debuted this year with [Dollar] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WZKZrR3AoU). Although they dont(yet) have a music video, their dance practice speaks volumes about the girls dance abilities. Each member individually updates about their whereabouts(and sometimes we get a surprise practice video.




 
[Kang Boram, soloist] (http://imgur.com/unPdFWF)


*Company:* BR Entertainment


*Genre:* Ballad


Kang Boram made her debut with Mini-Album [First, The Season] (http://www.mnet.com/album/523823) and a music video for title track [If It Hadnt Been for the Time] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npn1dfRDYes). She is the lyricist for all four tracks on the album.




 
[Lee Somi, soloist] (http://imgur.com/72HePxk)


*Company:* Two-H Media Group


*Genre:* Trot


Lee Somi debuted with 2-track Mini-Album Thank You, and a [title track of the same name] 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDto4jS-s0). Both songs seem to be a pop-trot crossover. I dont have much to say about this release because all I seem to remember is Ms. Lee poking the MVs lead actor in the butt. Im serious.




 
[Scandal, group] (http://imgur.com/LOxKeuV) *possibly disbanded*


*Company:* Kconic Entertainment


*Members:* Sarang, Aini, Honey


*Genre:* Semi-Trot


Scandal started out with 2 members, Aini and Sarang, when they debuted with [ ] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1gEPrc2iIQ) (I cant find a proper translation). They came back with a new member, Honey, and single [Tingle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cE8jrC8Das) (that rhymes). Unfortunately, there is a high possibility that the group has been disbanded, as all mention of them has been removed from Kconics webpage and they havent had any activity or social media updates since around March.




 
[Seo Ye Ahn, soloist] (http://imgur.com/Ra5l4xz)


*Company:* JTM Entertainment


*Genre:* Pop


Seo Ye Ahn(of Kpop Star 4 fame) made her official debut with [Permeate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke4QTwbhwWw), a beautiful ballad that relates the pain of losing someone(with an equally gorgeous sand art MV). She followed up with [Chocolate Kiss] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDrhLdtgEzE), a cute dance song featuring B1A4s Baro.




 
[Six Bomb, group] (http://imgur.com/zvgslMN) *Redebut*


*Company:* Pacemaker Entertainment


*Concept:* Sausage, Bubble Gum, Gumby, Pepto Bismol(Im not sure honestly)


*Members:* Dain, Soa, Hanbit, U Chung(formerly)


I have not yet met anyone who has been able to effectively describe what exactly the girls are wearing in their music video for [Wait 10 Years, Baby] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvk7JV-Ztik), but whatever they are, they gained the girls a lot of attention and a few million views on their official MV. The song, although deemed inappropriate for television broadcast, went viral for a time. Not only were the lyrics addressing younger men to wait until they were old enough to date noona, the pink outfits have gone down in history as the weirdest(and possibly most confusing) outfits in Kpop history but the group now has a fan base thats patiently waiting for them to release some more of their own songs. Six Bomb is a redebut of the six-membered group that debuted in 2012 but was later disbanded.




 
[Trot Girl, group] (http://imgur.com/D5d4ZmM)


*Company:* JN Entertainment

*Members:* Minji, Eunyoung, Eunhye

*Genre:* Trot(who wouldve thought?!)

I want to start this off by saying that Im not really a trot lover(or even casual listener). That said, I think this song rocks. So, Trot Girl debuted with the very addictive track [Come Closer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiOAuPuzoo), and thanks to a user on the Kpop Amino app, theyve been added to the list and will potentially find some listeners here. There are a bunch of Youtube videos featuring the ladies (they look like clips from a show but I cant tell).

Im currently doing a group project about the way people perceive asian peoples beauty around the world compared to the usual Korean beauty standards. 
I would like you to answer this survey if you have some free time (it shouldnt take longer than 5 minutes) : 
[Link to the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc22Tm37gH3ut5wETe9XmvnpSFtecJkg8dmH76a0q9eT4NULQ/viewform)

We basically picked 4 popular idol boy groups, considered generally attractive (or not) in Korea ; we would be interested to see which idols are considered good-looking around the world (of course you can still answer if you are Asian/Korean). 

I will post the results if you guys want me to, and will or will not post a ""girl group version"" depending on how well this survey was received. 

Thank you in advance :)",37,35

As of recent I've been picking up on a lot more of the 'edgy foreigner' stereotype.  For example, in AOA's ""Like a Cat"" MV, all the villain men are white (one with lots of tattoos); in Troublemaker's ""Now"" MV, all the people in the party are 'foreigners'.  I know its because in Korea, a lot of foreigners (especially Americans) are seen as more dangerous, edgy, or the partying type.  The whole cliche just makes me laugh.

Has anyone else noticed a cliche or stereotype like this that makes them laugh?  Other examples might be certain cheesey aegyo moves, certain dance moves, etc.

Edit: removed an example because of clarification/correction.",65,64

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

Whether they be serious or silly. My personal Kpop Nightmare is that Red Velvet will eventually get a concert, but they won't perform a full version of Automatic (or any version). This is a huge fear of mine, mainly because Red Velvet is my ultimate bias group in all Kpop, and Automatic is tied with Dumb Dumb for my favorite song by them, and it stems from another fear I have, which is that they just flat out won't ever get a concert/tour/Lightsticks, etc.

One of the things I like about kpop boy bands are the avant garde and androgynous clothes/makeup in shows and MVs. It's different than in the west and now that kpop is getting a worldwide fanbase, I was wondering if it redefines some of your own ideas about masculinity and femininity. 
Has this trend caused anyone to try out more kpop style like makeup and androgynous style?
Also from one of my favorite groups, f(x), AMBER is definitely not 'traditionally feminine,' but she's the only one I can think of that's remotely different from other kpop girl groups. 

I'm working on a class project and would love to hear ideas!",20,0

I'm a girl who likes girl groups more than guy groups (the only guy group whose releases and concepts I really like is SHINee). Some of the girl groups I keep track of: SNSD (of course, duh), Oh My Girl, f(x), Red Velvet, Ladies' Code, Nine Muses, Cosmic Girls, LOONA, and Blackpink. The reason why I'm not interested in guy groups is because I find Korean actors more attractive compared to how over-the-top male idols styling can be. Somehow it's also hard for me to like guy group concepts.

Whereas for girl groups, I feel like there are so many aspects to love besides the music: MV (I'm a very visual person), comeback concepts, hairstyle, makeup, stage outfits, choreos are easier to follow, even their physical looks. A lot of times, I look at a girl group member and think, ""I wish I could be as pretty as her..."" or ""I wish her clothes would look good on me""

My boyfriend of course likes girl groups. However, he finds my obsession for girl groups (especially my queen Taeyeon) weird. He even asked me multiple times just to make sure if I'm a lesbian or not??? Do guys misunderstand my point whenever I say a girl group member is super pretty? Cos whenever I say someone is pretty, I mean: DAMN EVERYTHING LOOKS ON POINT ON HER!!

And my main question: is it common for girls to be more obsessed with girl groups than guy groups? If it's completely common, how do I make my boyfriend understand?

Recently we had a ton of snow where I lived. This directly related to kpop Christmas song recommendations being asked for in my local kpop facebook group. So I put together a kpop Christmas list. Here:  
**[A Merry Kpop Christmas](https://play.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/1cFxo0E0RSPlTtHKZLc6Qe)**  
For people looking into extending this list with local files, I recommend SMTOWNs Winter albums. [2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOMgP4Htwsc) is the legendary one, but I recommend 2007 and 2006 for some awesome DBSK and Super Junior. Be careful with 2006 if you're a Cassie. I might have cried. In comparison, 2007 wasn't *as* bad. DBSK also released [Christmas Gift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xK8tVTESw) in 2004. It's amazing. For SMTOWN, theres also 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 for some retro SM (just look as these [track lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_Town#Albums)!)  
There were also a few songs that didn't really fit the atmosphere of this playlist. Like the k-hiphop christmas album [Blue Christmas](https://play.spotify.com/album/7gCtSeb8I13bYWIrl3Whou). I also avoided some songs on group's Christmas albums. Like BTOB's get-drunk song [Cheers!](https://play.spotify.com/track/4syDvpL4hdHJhWe1g4NKst) (seriously, look up those lyrics). Also some miscellaneous songs. If anyone's actually interested in these, let me know in the comments and I might put together an extended version.

1052,2016-11-14,2016,11,14,23,5cw6tw,[PSA] New MCountdown queuing system,z59sg,1479133667,"Hi all, I just spent two weeks traveling in Seoul. I queued for MCountdown twice but only got in once on November 10. It seems that there's a new, saner system  that doesn't involve queuing overnight.

Pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/8zOLd)

To stand a chance at getting into MCountdown, you have to go early on Wednesday to write down your name on the list. It will be started by the first person in the queue and will be taped to one of the lampposts outside the CJ E&amp;M building. I went at 9am on November 9th and was 12th in line then.

Notice the 'Check Time' at the bottom right corner of the list. These are the times that the first person in the queue will do a roll call. If you aren't there when your name is called, it is struck from the list. For the November 10th recording it was at 9pm on Wednesday night and 6.30am on Thursday morning.

At around 8.30am - 8.45am on Thursday an MCountdown staff will come out to take down the names of those who get to go in. The two times I was there, they only let 10 people in for the general admission. The rest of the spots are taken by official fanclub members and those who bought tickets to the recording.

If your name was taken down by the staff, congrats! You will need to come back at 4.30pm that afternoon for the show. They are extremely strict about numbers and will notice if you try to tailgate into the venue.

TL;DR

1. Find the namelist and write your name on Wednesday morning.

2.  Be there for the check times, if not your name will be struck from the list

3.  Hope you are 1st to 10th in line when the staff starts taking down names.

Good luck to those queuing up!",25,102

&amp;nbsp;

The main update relates to the music show posts. Two methods came up in the Town Hall and we decided the best way forward was to trial both. Please bear in mind that both methods are new and are therefore in their 'roughest' format. At the next Town Hall we will be asking your opinion on each.

&amp;nbsp;

Positive or negative please let your opinion be known there!

&amp;nbsp;

First up will be a week-ish of 'wiki' style posts. You will need to have been a member redit for at least a year and have a minimum of 200 subreddit karma. Any users that meet this requirement will be able to edit the wiki posts for each show!

&amp;nbsp;

Next up will be 'live posts' for these we will need people to be nominated for the posts if they wish to edit them. If anyone is interested in helping with the trial next week please either message the mods or myself, Hallyunoona, directly. We will select people from the applicants who have a good standing on the sub.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, please could everyone check out next Town Hall as we will be suggesting some rule changes for you to  comment on!

EDIT: Adding some more detail.

The wiki posts will be pages set up on the subs wiki, these posts can be edited by any user who meets the above requirement. The music show post on the sub will be a link post to the wiki. 

Live posts would be made using the reddit 'live' threads feature and would be link posts to the live thread. A trial of these will only go ahead if we have enough volunteers to update the post as these threads need assigned users in advance to edit them

Exams will be held November 17, 2016 from 8:40am to 5:40pm.

What is the CSAT? 

It is a standardized exam that occurs annually every November to test a student's skills/knowledge for them to be accepted into South Korean post-secondary. The exam consists of National Language, Math, English, Korean History, Social Studies, Sciences, Vocational Education, and Foreign Languages or Chinese Characters and Classics.

Below is a list of idols who have released their support for students taking the exam. ( If there are more videos, it would be appreciated if you left a comment below so I can add them to the list! (Thank you /u/tastetherainbeau !) In addition, more videos should be released as between today and tomorrow. )

1116,2016-11-15,2016,11,15,16,5d1bcx,Have Girl Groups Been Getting Larger Over Time? The Numbers.,CronoDroid,1479194781,"So a lot of people seem to think girl groups have been getting larger since the Silver Age where groups like Brown Eyed Girls, SNSD, WG and Kara have debuted. But have they? I've done a quick calculation of at least semi-relevant girl groups between 2006 (when BEG debuted) and now (last major girl group debut was Black Pink). I'm not sure I should be counting the other post-PD101 girl groups yet (Bulldok, Momoland, or IBI) because they're not super relevant as of yet, at least compared to Gugudan.

Here is the list of at least semi-relevant girl groups between 2006 and 2016, with their member count, of what is in my opinion their most notable/popular lineup - not necessarily the original one. And yes I know The Ark disbanded.

1.	Brown Eyed Girls 4
2.	Wonder Girls 5
3.	Kara 5 (debuted as 4)
4.	SNSD 9 (OT9)
5.	Sunny Hill 4 (not counting Janghyun)
6.	After School 8 (debuted as 5, but their most popular lineup by far was during the Bang era)
7.	2NE1 4
8.	4minute 5
9.	T-ara 6
10.	f(x) 5
11.	Secret 4
12.	Rainbow 7
13.	Sistar 4
14.	Miss A 4
15.	Girls Day 4 (debuted as five)
16.	Nine Muses 9 (debuted as nine, but with so many member changes, the most popular lineup is from Glue era - where they had nine)
17.	Dal Shabet 6 (currently four members, but had six during BBB/Joker era)
18.	Rania 5 (debuted with eight, had a lot of member changes, they had five around Style so that's what I'm going with)
19.	Brave Girls 7 (debuted with five, and it's arguable that their original line up was more popular at least in South Korea, but K-pop is more popular nowadays so I'm gonna use their current lineup)
20.	A Pink 6 (debuted with seven)
21.	Stellar 4 
22.	Spica 5
23.	EXID 5 (debuted with six)
24.	Hello Venus 6
25.	Crayon Pop 5
26.	Tahiti 5
27.	AOA 7
28.	Fiestar 5 (debuted as six)
29.	Ladies Code 5 (currently three members)
30.	Bestie 4
31.	Wassup 7
32.	Melody Day 4
33.	Mamamoo 4
34.	Red Velvet 5 (debuted with four)
35.	Laboum 6
36.	Minx 5
37.	Lovelyz 8
38.	Sonamoo 7
39.	GFriend 6
40.	CLC 7 (debuted with five)
41.	The Ark 5
42.	Oh My Girl 8
43.	April 5 (debuted with six)
44.	DIA 7 (debuted with eight)
45.	Twice 9
46.	WJSN 13 (debuted with 12)
47.	IOI 11
48.	Gugudan 9
49.	Black Pink 4

If you separate these debuts by my reckoning of generations (2nd Gen is from 2000 to 2009) then there are 12 2nd gen debuts in this list (BEG to Rainbow). Between the twelve groups, I count 66 members, leading to an average group size of **5.5**.

In 3rd Gen (starting from 2010 with Sistar's debut), there are 37 groups with 226 members, leading to an average of **6.10.** However, the big group trend has only been noticed recently. If you count from 2014 (starting from Melody Day's debut), there have been 123 members between 18 groups, leading to an average of **6.83.**

So in conclusion, yes, girl groups seem to be getting larger over time, at least if you count the relevant ones. I won't bother with boy groups because I'm not nearly as familiar with them as I am with girl groups.

You can watch kpop music videos or listen to kpop through this YouTube playlist. Also, if you like the playlist, you can share it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, and Reddit.

And this website works well in mobile environments like smartphones and tablet PCs.

The KPOP playlist on the website will be updated every Monday. (current: November 14, 2016)

The link is as follows :

 - https://www.inchartvideos.com/kpop (KPOP section of the website)

It also includes:

 - https://www.inchartvideos.com, https://www.inchartvideos.com/top100 (US HOT 100)

 - https://www.inchartvideos.com/uk100 (UK HOT 100)

And in another subreddit, I asked if he/she could see the past playlist. So I modified the website so that you could see past playlists. (Now there is only one playlist in the KPOP section, but this will be updated every Monday.)

At first I made this website for my use, but now I want to share this website with you.

If you have any impressions or suggestions, please let me know in comments.

Thank you for reading this post!",5,49

Just thought of the question because today GOT7 returned to SK after fanmeetings in Canada, and immediately had to go to another fansign. They were late and rushed and did not even have time to eat beforehand. The fansign ended up being shortened and many fans cried. And the theatre staff treated the fans poorly because they were upset about GOT7 being late. Also, today is Yugyeom's birthday so it kinda adds to the suck.

* [JB looking really upset when entering the theatre](https://twitter.com/dvvr_def/status/799261283069497344)

* [and you can hear fans sniffling/crying](https://twitter.com/flowerboynyeong/status/799252606002413568)

It really seems like this is due to mismanagement and prioritizing other groups - which I understand, prioritize the ones that make more money, however situations like this happen a lot and I think it's important to shed the light on them.

-

So what other groups get this treatment? Has fan outrage ever helped?

1303,2016-11-18,2016,11,18,3,5dha7j,My JYP Los Angeles Audition experience and why I'm stressing out over a month later...,Princess_Pufferfish,1479406031,"It's been a really long time since the auditions in LA, but I decided I wouldn't mind sharing.  First of all, I'm a 20 year old Caucasian female that is currently going to college for Digital Media Productions. Second of all, I'm from Wisconsin. This whole experience was incredible and I'm still amazed by it over a month later. If you only want to hear about the audition itself, without the parts leading up to it, skip to the ""STARTS HERE"" section (I know some people just want to know what they should expect). So, I'll just dive right in now, from square one. 

A few months ago I realized that JYP could do online audition submissions. Totally blew my mind, so I started preparing something. I ended up recording myself singing ""What Are Words"" with a really crappy mic and 3 sorta random photos. (For those that don't know the online audition requirements for JYP, you must submit a file of your talent--audio or video--and a minimum of 1 photo). It really wasn't well thought out, and I felt really rushed in doing it. I just wasn't super proud of what I had submitted. So the end of the month came--I believe it was July?--and JYP's Audition YouTube channel posted their monthly online winner. It wasn't me, and I was okay with that. School was starting soon, and more importantly, there were auditions for a show at our local community theater. It was a show I really wanted to do, since there was only one female role and It was about Peter Pan (I love Peter Pan, like...a lot). So I started school again and auditioned for the play. A few days later, I found out I had made the cut! Yay! I had the lead. Super exciting time in our house and I was all ready to get back into the school groove. My only thinking, in regards to the online audition was: ""If only I could go to a physical audition....then they'd see me in person, and maybe I'd have a better shot."" Well...That's exactly what happened. JYP announced their global auditions in LA, San Fran, New York, and Toronto shortly after we started rehearsals. Unfortunately for me, the New York and Toronto auditions were the same days we had out last two shows, and they were the closest cities to me. San Francisco was out too, since that was our opening weekend. So, I checked the rehearsal schedule and nearly chocked on the air in my lungs: We didn't have rehearsal the Fri. before the LA auditions. Even though it was lining up perfectly (and there's a whooole lot more that works out along the way), I still wasn't going to bank on us not have rehearsal in the off chance that we did. It would really be my luck for me to fly off to California and then get a call asking me why I'm not on stage. So I checked with the stage manager and director. They confirmed we wouldn't have any rehearsal that day and asked me where I was going. I just said LA and, naturally, I got a lot of awesome looks. ""Why?"" ""Alone!?"" ""For what??"" stuff like that. I explained and the rest of the cast and crew were all really supportive. I was pretty much the most excited person on the planet that day. I was planning on leaving Friday morning, arrive that night in LA, get a good night's sleep, go to the audition the next day, catch a plane home that night and be home sometime on Sunday. 
It might be important to note, that I live with my parents. Its cheaper than paying for rent and they let me eat their food. Win-Win. 
I bring that up, because my mom seemed really not into the idea at first. That bothered me a lot, since the audition was a big step for me and she was practically silent on the whole matter.
It's also important to note that I have some of the most amazing group of friends on the planet. They're just too awesome for words. So in the start, when I had a billion travel questions, they were my support system while I tried to find a way to get my mom on board. The thing I was most worried about was money. I didn't (still don't) have a job. I had one of those travel jars you fill with change, but the reality of that paying for everything was really unlikely. After calculating out all the money I had saved plus a little extra from my crazy awesome friends, I had more than enough to buy my tickets, my cab rides, my hotel, food, and even have left over in case something came up (and it did, just you wait). 
That was that, I had it all figured out. I had no excuses at this point. So I booked my tickets and hotel room (both of which were super cheap. Thank you student travel websites!). This was when my mom got on board. She told me she was really proud of me for doing it all on my own, but she, as a mother, was going to be worried. I reassured her I would keep in touch and tell her everything. 
My vocal teacher was also excited, so the point that she gave me a free lesson and had me keep the money I had brought that day. She gave me a bunch of tips on things I can do to warm up in the hotel room and posture etc. 
Fast forward to the day my plane leaves. One of my friends drove me from my hometown La Crosse, to Minneapolis airport Friday morning. I can't remember exactly, but i think my flight left at 11 or noonish. Then I had a connecting flight in O'Hare and would be arriving in LA at about 6:30...if I remember correctly. Anyway, I had only flown once before and I was probably 14 at the time and was not paying attention. I got to the airport, thanked my friend about a million times, and went through security. I only had a smallish backpack with me since I didn't really need anything but a change of clothes and my phone, so I got through pretty quick. I got some food in the terminal, found an outlet, and waited for my flight. The flight from Minneapolis to O'Hare was pretty quick, but around the time we landed I started to get a headache. (Turns out I get those when I fly! Good to know). After landing n Chicago I only had about 20 minutes before my flight left for LA. It was about this time I was getting crazy excited. I was so close. 

We boarded, I settled in with a movie some music and tried to fall asleep. Unfortunately, my headache was absolutely unbearable at this point. I felt like throwing up it was so bad. Despite the pounding, I was still able to appreciate the city below us as we landed. The Hollywood sign looked so small from our seats it was crazy. I left the airport pretty fast and called my driver (Uber is the only way to go). It was about 45 minutes to my hotel from LAX, so I sat back and enjoyed the city. I love big cites so it was pretty easy to enjoy. 
When I arrived it was already almost dark, but thankfully the hotel had the name painted on the side of the building so the driver could see. I checked into my hotel and finally relaxed. I tried to get some sleep, but it wasn't really working out well. After about an hour I decided to go out and get some food. It was probably 8 or so when I headed out. I was in Koreatown, about a block or so from the building the auditions were in so there was Korean food everywhere. Korean barbecue? Yes...yes please. The restaurant was full of smoke and the smell of meat and it was glorious. I still had a headache, but I knew I needed to eat something. 
The people behind me were being hilariously embarrassing, but that's a story for another time. 
I still wasn't feeling very well, so I ended up taking the ribs I ordered back to my hotel room to eat the next day or later if I was hungry then. On my way back I stopped in a convenience store and bought two huge bottles of water and some Tylenol. I was kicking that headache's butt no matter what. 
The headache actually ended up being a good thing. I was super tired and I wasn't nervous. If I hadn't had the headache, I probably would have been awake all night worrying about the audition. Nope. Slept like a rock. 




STARTS HERE

I woke up sorta early and managed to catch the sunrise before I showered and started to get ready. Check out for my hotel was at 11, but my audition time was until 1:30 or so. I thought I'd figure something out, if anything, I'd just hang out at the venue for a few hours and people watch. 
Turns out, the auditions were ""First come, first serve"" in the sense that they tell you a time in the hopes that people won't all just rush in at 8am. I literally had no idea where to go. Aside from knowing it was the huge tall building down the block and it was the 19th floor, I didn't know where the door was or anything. So I pretended like I knew what I was doing and just walked right past the security desk. I guess they were cool with it cause I got to the 19th floor and stood in line no problem. 
I handed the desk lady my sheet (I had registered previously) and got my number. 

They sent me into this room that had a bunch of chairs and a TV in the front. The TV was playing music videos of JYP artists (the volume was too loud by the way, almost couldn't hear my number). I know it played Miss A, Day 6, GOT7,Twice, and J.Y. Park while I was sitting there. There really wasn't anything else to do while I was sitting so I watched the videos and people watched. The lady came up with our sheets and announced us in groups of 5. I went up with my group and she walked us down a hallway where we would wait before going into the room. While we were standing there she was looking through our sheets and making small talk. When she got to my sheet she did the whole ""Wisconsin? You flew here from Wisconsin? Alone??"" thing. When the small talk was over, one of the groups ahead of us was done so we could go wait outside the door. 
One of the girls explained that when you go in there is a line directly in front of the door. The 5 of us will stand on the line and wait until we are called. Then we will stand in front of the backdrop on the T in front of it. There was one model in our group, so she had to forward to another line and pose 3 times. We put our bags outside the door and entered the room. The room itself was like a broadcasting room so there were big TV cameras and a set for news anchors. There were two people behind the table, one was the ""judge"" the other was the camera guy. The Judge explained that he will tell us when we can go and then he'll ding the bell next to him when he wants us to stop. The first girl went up and sang and forgot her lyrics a bit. The judge was pretty good and just told her to continue. For every person who went up he would write some things down and then get ready to ding the bell. I'm assuming its his first impressions and thoughts, but I'm not sure. 
The second girl who went rapped. I recognized the song, but for the life of me could not remember the name. (It literally bothered me the whole way home). Then the girl who modeled and then a little boy who was about 13. I remember him because he was super adorable and sang ""Wrecking Ball,"" but forgot the lyrics. I was last in the group and went up to the T to sing. He told me I could go so I looked into the camera and started singing. I wasn't looking anywhere else and I kind of zoned out because I was in the moment, but I saw him write something down and then get ready to ding the bell. He cut me off and I stopped. He thanked us for coming and we left the room. We thanked the door lady and walked back through he waiting area with our bags. Then I just took the elevator back down and left the building. The whole thing was over in like 15 minutes. I sat outside for a while to sort of process before calling my Uber driver to take me to the airport. I would be waiting around for a while, but I didn't mind. 

That was kind of when things went down hill. I leaned against a tree while I was waiting for my driver and when I leaned away I had tree sap all over my arm. It stuck to everything. One of those things that you just really don't need in the moment. I did wash SOME of it off in the airport bathroom, but it didn't really do anything. I didn't end up getting it completely off until I got home and my mom used WD40 on it. Anyway, the Uber driver I had was asking me things like ""Where are you going? Why are you in LA?"", stuff like that. When I told him he seemed excited at first and then when I told him I wanted to move Korea, he instantly told me not to. The entire 45 minutes to LAX consisted of him practically lecturing me on why I should stay in LA and not follow my dreams. He apparently had traveled the world when he was young and regretted it. My Sassy thoughts wanted to retort ""How would you know that you would regret it if you hadn't done it?"" but I kept it to myself. He even tried to tell me that I should just stop singing altogether. When I finally got out of the car and was through security, I did a lot of wandering. Just sort of walked around the terminal for a while. I bought some food, charged my phone for a while, bought some more food etc. I ended up chugging an energy drink for whatever reason and really needed to go the bathroom by the time we needed to board so I waited uncomfortably for the seatbelt light to turn off before racing back to the bathroom on the plane. It was a long ride home, and I had a headache again so I tried to sleep a little. It ended up being midnight when I got into Minneapolis. I was originally going to take a train back home from there. The ticket booth didn't open until 8 and the train didn't leave until 10 so I had to wait around for a LONG time. I left the airport to go the station simply because I would rather be at the place I'm SUPPOSED to be than wait around. My phone is almost dead when I get there. I try to plug in my phone when a security guard stops me and asks to see my ticket. She informs me those that do not have purchased tickets cannot sit in the area I was sitting and I would have to move to the lobby. So I go to the lobby and find and outlet. There she is again, walking around the corner, hands me a sheet with rules and says ""You are not allowed to charge you phone here. It is against our rules.""...It's about 1:30 at this point. I just nod, because I'm tired and fed up. ""Oh, and the station will be closing at 3 and won't open until 5. You'll have to go somewhere else in the meantime."" Their website says they are open 24/7. That, I think, was it for me. I couldn't say anything because I could feel myself starting to cry. So I walked out of the station and onto the front steps. My phone only had about 15% left and Minneapolis is a scary place for a 20 year old...Especially at 3AM. I called my mom because...You just need your mom sometimes. The only thing she heard when she picked up the phone was just sobbing. After I managed to explain the situation and we both were angry about it, she told me to go back to the airport and wait there. She knew there was a shuttle that goes from the Twin Cities to La Crosse from the airport but would have to go check first. So I called another driver and went back. (Note that my phone died AS I'm on the phone with him trying to find me). I get BACK to the airport, plug my phone it and call my mom back. She had bought me a ticket for a shuttle home and I would have to wait there until probably 6:30. I could handle that. I tried to sleep. I watched some KDramas. Tried to sleep some more and waited. I did get home okay, thankfully, but being kicked out of a train station at like 2am is kind of terrifying. 

So...Why am I still stressing out about it now? Well, I've been checking the internet a lot since and the people who asked the desk ladies apparently said JYP would notify those who passed sometime in November. However, THEN JYP announced their Sydney auditions, making me and probably others, wonder if they're going to wait until after then to announce. If I don't make it, I'll be totally fine. It was a great experience if nothing else. The constant ""not knowing"" game is the worst. It hurts my head, it stresses me out, it makes me question my skills and myself. 

Thank for sticking with me through this SUPER long post. You're awesome.  ",29,12

That is all. Godspeed, Jay. Godspeed. 

Also, sorry if this does not belong here. Feel free to remove if you don't think it is appropriate. 

**edit to everyone returning:** I checked the station's playlist and no Jay Park. (They publish the songs they played throughout the day in case you want to know the name of a song).

[January Females] (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5cfnam/discussion_2016_kpop_debuts_female_artists_that/)


Hey /r/kpop! So I've been keeping track of every artist that debuted this year and I thought it would be a good idea to share the list with you all. I hope this helps you find new music that fits your taste. Some small things that I would like to note: this list does not contain soloists or subunits of previously debuted groups, most pictures will show only the current line-ups of the groups. I will be adding more of these in the next few weeks, all the way until the December releases, then I will restart for 2017. Also, if there are any artists who did not have a music video when they debuted, I will be including them here as special mentions. I tried to gather all of the debuts, but if I leave any out please let me know.
 
Ill be listing each artist in alphabetical order and depending on how much I know about the artists I will provide a general rundown of facts about their releases and the members if possible. 
 
Note: If anybody wants Facebook/Twitter/Instagram information about any of the artists, PM me and Ill send you what I have. I follow most of them on Instagram and I have a lot of Facebooks and Twitter accounts listed so it shouldnt be too hard.
 
**Male Artists**
 
[99%, soloist] (http://imgur.com/09eyu4U)


*Company:* The Tone Entertainment


*Genre:* Indie


In his debut single [Absence] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiHq_0MpigI), 99% blessed us with rich vocals(or at least me, I love ballads) while reminding us of how important it is to tell our parents that we love them(my Korean isnt the best but thats what I understood). His second single, [Were the Same Age] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0pFTJuEfxc), is a duet with singer Baby G. In between his original songs, he released an [acoustic cover] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b0C2B34Oq4) of AOAs Heart Attack.


 
[Jo Sub, aka Cho Seob, soloist] (http://imgur.com/hA9eOkP)


*Company:* no company


*Genre:* Pop Ballad


Cho Seob is actually a [Youtuber] (https://www.youtube.com/user/whtjq007/videos) who debuted with the single [Wait for Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp1HJcB09nA) as part of a project album for producer Kancho.


 
[Highend, group] (http://imgur.com/xRgctSs) *Special Mention, disbanded*


*Company:* HEM Entertainment


*Concept:* Rap/Hip-Hop, EDM


*Members:* Sihwan, HD, Hwanho, Junhee, Bobby  


Highend wouldve debuted with lots of attention but the group was marked with problems even before the music video for their debut song [Automatic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxcIAdSduSI) was released. The group was supposed to debut in 2015 with 5 members, but rapper Bobby Choi, also known as [Swisha] (https://soundcloud.com/bobby-choi-6) left before the music video to their debut song Automatic was released to the public. While Bobby gave the company permission to use his lyrics, they refused to remove his voice and had another member lipsync over the original track. In the end the group dissolved completely. Three of the members, Sihwan, HD, and Junhee were supposed to debut under Pacemaker Entertainment (Six Bombs company) as NewBlood. The [dance practice] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9WJPQnlPMc) for Automatic is still available.


 
[Imfact, group] (http://imgur.com/vjUbzZY)


*Company:* Star Empire Entertainment


*Concept:* Nae-nae


*Members:* Taeho, Jian, Lee Sang, Ung Jae, Je Up


Ah, yes (Megaminds arachnis deathicus voice). Imfact - the group that refuses to let the nae-nae die. Their group name is a combination of the words Impact(for the impact they want to have on the KPOP world) and Im Fact (for the truthful music that they want to release). Side note: Ive never met someone who is Fact but I guess. They debuted with [Lollipop] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_CTPzCHElU), which had a schoolboy concept and a chorus full of nae-naes. Recently, they pulled a complete concept reversal, turning themselves into bad boys(I guess) while unsurprisingly adding the nae-nae(and a dab) in their choreography. Also, their [Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqwjHeZgPP8lgjvcOTVazQ/videos) is regularly updated with shenanigans.


 
[Jinade, soloist] (http://imgur.com/vleSCWY)


*Company:* Deeper Record


*Genre:* Rap/Hip-Hop


Jinade made his solo debut with [Only For You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28fz-f_Kws), a love-themed rap song featuring Yoo Seungah. In February, he debuted as one of the members in Deeper Records project hip-hop group, Deepercent(who I will link in a future post). 

 
[Joo Yeonwoo, soloist] (http://imgur.com/ZD1orps)


*Company:* Yoram Entertainment


*Genre:* Pop Ballad


I cant be the only one who thinks Joo Yeonwoo is adorable. He doesnt have a music video for his debut single [Call Again] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6gWFu1sW5w) but on his companys Youtube page there are a bunch of videos of his photoshoot. It seems like his company is actually a comic book/manhwa company.

 
[JunGyo, soloist] (http://imgur.com/RiEH0lg)


*Company:* Bambyul Music


*Genre:* Ballad


JunGyo debuted with a very soothing ballad called [Winter Flower] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUbIt3tsRsQ) and has not yet released anything else, which concerns me because I love his voice and would like to hear more of it immediately(like I said, Im a sucker for ballads). Pianist Mugamgak provided the background music for this song.

 
[Learning Project, band] (http://imgur.com/serhlFg)


*Company:* Sky Music


*Members:* Rhew Gunyoung, TL Lee Giho, e-Mo


*Genre:* Rock, Indie


Learning Project debuted with title track [Hit the Road] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc5BKwTvFnE) off of the same titled album earlier this year. Rhew Gunyoung, the leader of Learning Project uploaded the entirety of the bands debut album, Hit the Road, to his [Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/user/ghrhew).




 
[MADE, group] (http://imgur.com/TDxM11q)


*Company:* S-made Entertainment


*Concept:* Vocal Performance


*Members:* MEKID, Sung Hwan, Jiyong


MADE is a new vocal group that is sure to brighten your day the minute you listen to their music. All three members are all former members of disbanded boy groups: MEKID was known as Minki in the group Airplane, and Jiyong and Sung Hwan were both members of the short-lived boy group Attack. They debuted with the single [He Turned His Head] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9UQ4d7npPs), and released three other singles, [Talk Talk Talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgcZ-Xw6s4), [You and Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94BVqQ-2zC8), and [Beautiful My Girl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jmhllUIuR4).


 
[Solvang, soloist] (http://imgur.com/IrgSin1)


*Company:* Coconut Entertainment


*Genre:* OST, Pop Ballad


Before the artist formerly known as Kim Kihyun made his official debut in 2016, he sang [Soul Mate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHMdPvrZX0k), an OST for the K-drama Producers, and [As Time Goes By] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udzoJaRkrA0), an OST for Reply 1988. This year he adopted the stage name Solvang (probably because everyone mistakes him for Monsta Xs Kihyun and debuted with [Standing in Hongdae] (http://www.mnet.com/album/526189) and later released two other singles, [Walking Together at Cheonggyecheon Stream] (http://www.mnet.com/album/543626) (this is the best translation I could come up with) and [3 AM] (http://www.mnet.com/album/606987).


 
[STlike, duo] (http://imgur.com/u9nGahI)


*Company:* Worthy Entertainment


*Members:* ScAr, TwoKi


*Genre:* Rap, Hip-Hop


STlike, a new rap team duo(do you understand that reference?) debuted with [Come Up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSDU7IApCoI). Later on they released a single called [Traffic Light] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQ9zZ3tjWk), featuring Lee Hwanhee (former SM Trainee and one of SNSD Seohyun unnies friends). Their most recent single is the gently titled [Killin It] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxUsutsr34I). 


 
**Co-Ed Artists**

[On the Road, project group] (http://imgur.com/nI4ociB) 


*Company:* Movement Generation


*Members:* Wonbo, Bitna, Youngin


*Genre:* 


On the Road is a co-ed project group made up of Neighbros Jung Wongbo, Merry Rounds Go Youngin, and soloist Cha Bitna. They have released three singles/single albums for the project: [My Way] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiNSTSkcLAg), [On the Road Parts 1+2] (http://www.mnet.com/album/566208), and [On the Road Part 3] (http://www.mnet.com/album/607049).
 

 
**Also, I forgot to add Tuesday Playground (female soloist) to the first list.**


[Tuesday Playground] (http://imgur.com/avwnhOD) *special mention*


*Company:* Roa Entertainment


*Genre:* Indie


If you love indie Tuesday Playground is for you. She is actually an illustrator who embarked on a digital music project(called Illustration Meets Music). Shes one of the artists that I completely skipped over in the first half of the year and came to regret it later on when I decided to play her songs over and over *and over* again. Theres something about her voice that I love but that I cant put into words, but Tuesday Playground will forever be a part of my music collection. She debuted in December with [Little Star] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H8JNdmTpXM), a Christmas song. Her singles [Perhaps I] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IY8lfv4iTo) as well as her follow up, [Dear Summer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDElsPOh1R0), are both in my top 50 songs of the Year and will forever be a part of my musical collection. I added her as a special mention because Dear Summer was her first music video.

I myself don't keep up with Rookies at all, compared to established, already debuted groups, so are there any to really look out for? 

Even though they JUST had a comeback, I'm personally most looking forward to a Full Album from Red Velvet sometime closer to the May/June period of the Summer. Preferably with a Double Title Track similar to Automatic sounding for one and Dumb Dumb sounding for the other. I'd even love it if they had some really dope packaging for the album, unlike their past releases. Ultimate versions, as well, like Member specific ones with corresponding photobooks and stuff like that. SM could take a page from JYP's book as far as album packaging goes. 

Second place would go to TWICE as I'm incredibly anxious to see them come out with a full album as well, but I think we'll probably be in for another mini or two before that happens. 

Lastly would be BLACKPINK. They've really wowed me this year with their 4 singles, and I'm DYING for a Mini, or even Full Album. (Wishful thinking).

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

1457,2016-11-20,2016,11,20,13,5dwj46,[Discussion] What do you think companies can do to manage their groups/idols better?,Rankstuff,1479617340,"Looking at TWICE's success, I think JYP really got the formula right and the formula ended up being quite obvious:

* They were hyped up with his show

* Their personalities were sort've 'screentested' to see if the audience would like them or not

* and then they were given catchy songs and literally promoted the crap out of them with barely any time in between for people to forget who they are. 

Yes they've had some criticism for their ""live"" talent but in the end, he took hard working &amp; likeable girls and showed people what they can do as a group. Simple as that.


Meanwhile, YG...
 He has Blackpink and as rookies, they are SO much better at performing than a lot of groups **(this is subjective but I truly think they out-perform most at dancing and stage presence... their vocals aren't MAMAMOO-level but they are pretty good and shown to be live)** But as pointed out with the recent awards drama....they haven't promoted much to solidify that they are up to the hype they are being given.
And I think it was a big mistake for YG to pit them against TWICE for this comeback. It really diminished their impact and if he had let them comeback at a later time, then they would've won more awards and not been #2 to TWICE. 


Sorry for this rant but overall just wanted to see what you all think companies can do to manage their idols/groups better? Or, in other words,  to just be more successful and prevent flops lol. 

**Mine in a nutshell:**


1) **YG** - Promote BP with more than just hype. Give them the appearances, shows, make them consistent like TWICE.

2) **SM** - Stop dressing up RV like cupcakes and give them the activities they deserve (more comebacks, more shows...C'MON!)

1494,2016-11-21,2016,11,21,7,5e0jir,Do you feel a connection with giant groups like TWICE (9 members) and SNSD (8 members)?,LeeHyori,1479680603,"My two favorite groups are, by far, the new Wonder Girls (band) and BLACKPINK. 

I think a major reason for this is that I feel I can really connect with each of them, whereas I have difficulty connecting with the larger groups due to their size. At 4 members (WG and BP), it's enough diversity to be fun, but not so much that it's hard to keep track of everyone. Indeed, I love the new Wonder Girls much more than the old one because there are fewer members. Before, even though I liked them, I didn't feel the same level of connection with each of the members. Now I can really see and connect with each of their personalities. With fewer members, it feels like each member plays a more significant and distinct role. They comprise 1/4 of the group instead of just, say, 1/9th. 

The same goes for BLACKPINK. I can keep track of who's who, and I think it breeds such a great dynamic even between members. They're like closer friends. I feel like BLACKPINK wouldn't be what it is if we tacked on another five members! 

When I look at groups like TWICE, I want to connect with them, but I'm so overwhelmed. It's like the difference between having a small hangout with friends where you can really get to know everyone and going to a giant party. I sometimes feel like it's so unnecessary to have so many members, too. 9 seems like A LOT. But TWICE is so popular.

I am wondering if you guys feel the same way, and if there are fans of TWICE and SNSD here, how you guys manage to stay deeply connected when there are simply so many of them! 

Would love to hear your thoughts!",52,13

Translation:

1st generation boy group **god** member Park Joon Hyung is now a father-to-be. 

Park posted on his Instagram account on the 16th, saying 
&gt;Yo~ I wanted to wait til the pregnancy was at a safer stage or after birth to announce to [everyone] the good news, so I only told close family and **god** members a few days ago. Sorry to any family members and friends I hadn't told yet.

He continued, writing 
&gt;This was taken at 12 weeks, we're at a little over 14 weeks now and very healthy~ the nose and facial structure are really sharp and kind of like mine ^ ^ we're expecting the baby to come out next spring, which means we're both born on a year of the rooster.

Along with his message, he posted an ultrasound of the baby.

Finally, he finished the post with words of appreciation and excitement towards becoming a father, writing
&gt;I'm just grateful for this baby, I don't care if it's a boy or a girl. As long as it's healthy I'll be happy~ To all the people who sent congratulations, thank you.

Park married his wife, a flight attendant 13 years his junior, last June, after dating for a year.

Meanwhile, Park's group **god** is planning a nationwide concert tour titled '2017 god to MEN Concert', between January 6th to the 8th, 2017.

In addition to the OSTs, CBX and Seulgi (as well Red Velvet minus Yeri as she is not currently promoting with them) performed a couple of their own songs from this comeback season. I tried to find fancams/videos of all the performances so you don't have to click through the entire v-live to find everything. If you're a fan of CBX or Red Velvet though, I recommend watching the v-live--it's really interesting!

I've been wondering if people would use an app dedicated to making/browsing reaction videos (not just kpop reactions, any reactions). The app would make it easier to create a reaction video using your phone + help you find all reaction videos based off a particular source video (e.g. a particular korean MV) or let you see the latest popular reaction videos for a genre (like korean MVs) or related to a hashtag (like #AMAs). 

On the creation side, it would basically let you select a 'source video' (off of youtube), let you record your reaction via your front-facing camera, and combine them into a reaction video. On the browsing side, the app would be organized so you could browse based on source video link, category, hashtags, genres, and keywords. E.g. you could see all reactions to a particular music video sorted by popularity, all reactions to a clip from the AMAs last night, etc. You could also see the latest popular reaction vids in a genre like kpop. You would be able to subscribe to not only reactioners but also to source-artists, genres, categories, keywords - and get a personalized feed of popular new reaction vids based on your subscriptions.

1646,2016-11-23,2016,11,23,9,5eeb9l,[Discussion] Which idols have gone through hardships to get to where they are now?,thegentleginger,1479860951,"We occasionally hear about the few idols who come from rich families or were the top students in their year. However, who are the idols who really struggled to get to their current position? This includes numerous failed auditions, family conflict, etc.

For example, I know 2NE1'S Park Bom failed several auditions before finally being accepted into YG. There's also the long list of ""former JYP trainees"". On the other hand, I recently heard about how IOI/Gugudan's Sejeong has complicated family matters and managed to persevere in order to debut. 

Are there any other stories like this? 

Edit: I realize all idols have suffered through the harsh trainee days. I guess I just wanted to find out how much personal hardship there was with family or finance rather than the notorious diets and practices. Thanks for all the posts though! I've learned a lot!! ",35,19

1652,2016-11-23,2016,11,23,11,5eev47,Sexiness and Sensuality in K-Pop - An Androgynous Discussion,Ciryandor,1479867889,"So I initially saw [this AKP](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/11/top-10-sexiest-female-idols-ranked) article on my social media feed and thought that it was one of those click-bait driven articles made to provoke fanbases. However, this led me to a whole different set of questions when I was thinking of why similar discussions for male idols did not exist at all.

Thus, I want to propose the following questions for an in-depth discussion with an inclusive bent:

* What are the standards and expectations that people have in K-Pop? How much does it differ between the sexes and between international and local fans?

* Are there actions and behaviors that would be acceptable in certain arenas which would be acceptable and/or unacceptable for performances and other activities? Are idols constrained by their most restrictive rules on performances given the ubiquity of fan-cams and other recording methods that would make it easy to share more titillating content?

* When it comes to packaging groups, why has there been a decline in overtly-sexy debut concepts? Has the industry adjusted its own expectations on sexiness with groups that some unacceptable concepts then would be commonplace today?

* How different are the expectations in expressions of sexuality between male and female groups? Are there specific aspects to this that you think do not make sense given fan and group behaviors?

* When it comes to individual performers and performances, what gives them more latitude when it comes to these expressions versus a full group? Does this latitude really exist, or is it just companies and groups unwilling or unable to take similar steps?

If there's very specific questions or insights you want to propose or discuss, feel free to add them in!",24,14

Events (*disclaimer: this is what I've been reading from fan accounts + other Starlights, most of this info has been circling around the community*) : There was a misunderstanding created between fans, and a fan site owner. A fan site owner uploaded a picture on their own SNS account. The picture contained a cake celebrating Leo's birthday which was on Nov 10th. The cake was part of a support project that was approved by Jellyfish Entertainment however some fans were not aware of its approval. Fast forward to a fansign, Leo was ""caught"" talking for ""a longer than expected time"" with this fan site owner, thanking her for the project and fans began speculating that there was a private relationship between the two. In addition to this, Leo also recently uploaded a picture on his [Instagram with a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3eDB7Co.jpg) of him streaming Milky Way on MelOn with the lyrics ""   "" highlighted. These lyrics translating to ""Dont doubt our relationship"". Later another rumour arose which was along the lines of how VIXX members providing and only supporting projects from ""well-off"" fan site owners and Starlights, stating there was a prejudice. Fans then began to ~~right~~ write hateful messages and created more rumours to spread.

Translation: (cr: [FY! VIXX](http://fyeah-vixx.com/) )


Hello, this is Jellyfish Entertainment.


First, we apologize for the confusion caused to Starlights by the part left out of the announcement uploaded on the 23rd, and we will give an explanation about the post uploaded on an SNS site on the 20th.


The object of concern, that the support team requested a cake or there was a special birthday party or birthday celebration prepared specially for the support team, is definitely false.


The member was merely conveying his greetings as an expression of gratitude to the support team who came to the Monte Cristo rehearsal site on November 9th, so please refrain from exaggerated interpretation and conjecture.


In the future we will be more cautious so that this kind of misunderstanding does not occur during support.


Additionally, due to the uploading of the misleading picture and caption, Starlights were caused confusion; we further identified the misunderstandings and rumors that were created as acts of invasion of privacy through fans many reports; and we identified that Byulset members were involved.


Accordingly, from today onward, the fan club members in question will not be able to participate in broadcasts/events/fansigns with VIXX, will be expelled from Byulset, and have been informed they will not be able to join the fan club. In the future, we plan to take a strong stance in this same way against those who cause misunderstandings and invade privacy.


Also, in order to protect the rights and interests of our companys artists, we will take legal action and deal strongly with the circulation of falsehoods and cases of defamation such as malicious rumors and falsehoods online, character attack, and hateful comments.


Once again, we apologize for the worry caused to Starlights for the misunderstandings and conjecture caused by this case.

--------------------------


edit: Used the wrong ""write"".


I should also note the lyrics that were uploaded onto his Instagram were not his lines from the song, but rather Ravi's.


Since these events of Leo deactivating and privatizing his SNS accounts, other members have not been active on their own personal accounts. Only account active is the [official group account](https://twitter.com/RealVIXX).",36,202

However, JYP is still a smaller company in terms of profit and yet both TWICE and GOT7 have had two mini albums in the past 12 months. 

On a side note, with the momentum that TWICE and GOT7 have, JYP may be the #2 company sooner rather than later. 

Lee Hi and AKMU have already released albums this year, so they probably won't have new albums for at least another year. The Bigbang members are all entering the military within the next two years or so. With Bigbang releasing an album with new tracks in December, it is highly unlikely that iKON will make a comeback this year. 

There were several hints of Nam Taehyun's frustrations with YG. YG's reasoning was his mental health, but in the past year Taehyun released his own tracks on SoundCloud and voiced his frustrations on not being able to sing. He's been a crucial piece to the group, and without him WINNER really isn't the same. 

On the other hand, YG has hit a home run with Blackpink. The process has been similar to Bigbang's MADE release last year, with each double track being its own MV. All four of their songs have a big-time feel to them. I believe they still have 2 or 4 MVs already completed and waiting for release, which is fantastic. This group has the potential to be global superstars. It does help that Jennie and Rose are fluent in English, and Lisa being fluent in Thai. This group can replace the juggernaut that was Bigbang, and possibly even surpass it. But YG has to push them correctly, rather than place them on a 2 year hiatus. 

By February 2017, we'd have lost 2NE1 and Nam Taehyun, and Bigbang won't be together as a 5 member group for at least 3-4 years. Wow.",124,126

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

(A side note: I have been planning this thread for a while now, but the fabulous /u/SaveOurSeouls beat me to the punch earlier today and posted a physical album thread.  I had jokingly bemoaned my luck, as I had been planning to do the same this very day after I got off of work, and then posted my collection there.  But when I got on break at work, I had a message from /u/SaveOurSeouls saying that they were sorry and didn't mean to take the thread from me, so had deleted it.  I never intended for that to happen, but I just wanted to give that person a shout out for doing that for me unasked, when they didn't have to.  It was very sweet, so thank you.

I've never seen so many YG stans actively saying for real that they are done with the company. Will people still support YG artists as they once did, and will this blow over? Or are people finally done?

The suspicions of a connection with Choi Soon-sil of course are also a thing in Korea that could affect YG.

Also, i very much enjoyed doing these wallpapers so I was thinking that maybe if enough of you like it I could do them sporadically with group requests from you guys, so if any of you want one of your fav idol/group then leave a comment or PM me.

Alternatively maybe they all suck and in that case i'm sorry. Also mods if this is not the appropiate sub for this then feel free to take down the post.

1931,2016-11-27,2016,11,27,5,5f1fji,Fanaccount of SHINee fansign,L-autrichienne,1480192507,"So... My first ot5 fansign... 

It came on the heels of a particularly painful recording line up which I barely made. I ran to coex and changed in the thankfully very clean bathrooms there. Ate a little bit but honestly I had no appetite so I couldn't finish my fries (they were shitty McDonald's fries so it wasn't like I was leaving good stuff). 

I got myself checked in, made up again (after spending hours on the snow), and into the seating area. It was very very open and people had set up camp all around. Fansites and friends everywhere. We waited about 15 minutes before SHINee showed up... They were about 15 minutes early surprisingly. 

When they walked in I about choked. I knew it was a very real possibility due to timing but I still didn't think they'd show up in their very revealing music core outfits. Like those plunging necklines and chokers. It was devastating. Especially Jonghyun's flowy shirt. All the girls around me were just like ""Noooooooooooo."".

They started. And the first up was a little boy had apparently been at my friend's closed fansign Thursday night as well. He gave each member candy and went through the wrong way so he kinda had them all to himself for a bit since the girls who who in the right order just waited for him to finish before starting. He was cute and so excited and SHINee were so sweet with him. 

Then they started in earnest. I was 77. I had close friends at 27, 55, and 84. I couldn't really watch my friend at 84 as she was too close to me but my other friends I was able to watch the members and it was so nice to see their smiles at my friends words and and gifts. 

Finally I was up. As I was standing by Onew I finally started getting nervous. Not to speak but just because up close he was so fucking stunning yesterday. His outfit and makeup and hair just suited him so well, he was distressingly handsome. But then it was my turn and I had to get the fuck over it. 

It's hard to memorize different shit to say to each member so I decided not to bother and to just be selfish yesterday. I asked each one to write their first impression of me, something to make me smile. 

So I walked up to Onew, said hello in Korean and handed him my album. I said my ""Please write your first impression of me, something that will make me smile please"" and he confirmed. Looked aside. And then he made eye contact. 

It was like making eye contact with a tiger in the jungle. I couldn't break the eye contact or he might eat me. We stared at each other for like 20 full seconds. My friend who filmed for me started saying Omg cause it was taking so long. 

Finally I guess he just gave up. Jinki was in a very no nonsense mood, very sassy, and he was not having our shit last night. So he asked in Korean what I liked. But it didn't make sense so I thought I'd misunderstood. Then in English he said ""what you like? Anything."" and I was like ""uh anything?"" and he said ""aaaannnyyytthhhiinng"". My mind ran through you&gt;SHINee &gt;Jonghyun before arriving at ""cat?""... So Jinki drew me a very cute cat.

Honestly I wanted a bizarre experience with him, it was perfect. I didn't understand and still an very confused and I feel like that's how Jinki fansigns should end. 

Next was Key. He'd had a line at the beginning of the fansign but by the time I got there he didn't. So I was fumbling a bit trying to switch photobooks quickly. He was patient and said hello in Korean. I asked him to write his first impression on Korean but then I switched to English to say something to make me smile. Frankly it's kinda weird to say on English but it's a normal request for Korean fans and I can ignore the weirdness easier if I'm speaking Korean. 

While he was signing, I told him that I saw his play Save The Green Planet and that I really loved it. He asked how much I could understand and I said about half which was true. He then laughed and said ""even as the main actor there were times when he didn't understand"". I told him that I thought his portrayal of a mentally unstable character was really great and I thought he did a wonderful job. He smiled, thanked me and I left. He'd written, in English, ""Love ur hair"". I giggled a lot at the ""ur"", it's so perfectly Key. 

I was just dazzled by Key. Like I've long thought that he is the most beautiful human on the planet but while talking to him and while waiting for Taemin I just kept looking at him. He's so damn beautiful. His eyeliner was dark blue and it matched his hair. He was so sexy but then I made him do one of his kitten smiles and it was the cutest thing on the planet. 

Next was the mile long line for Taemin. That child just had no control over the situation. His line was longer than the one to start the fansign. He was being greasy and indulgent of everyone. At one point he pretended to pick his nose and flick a booger at us. A girl asked him to tell her what she looked like and he said ""Baby hippo"" cause there cute and he drew a hippo blob in her book. He was just something else. 

So I actually have the least memory of him. As usual I went up to him and requested that he write his first impression. He kept repeating the word for it. And he was smiling and looking at me but he was a little shy seeming. He did comment that I spoke Korean well. He was very sweet and took his time signing. I found a picture and he looked like he was listening closely albeit a bit confused. Poor duck. He ended up writing ""You're very beautiful"".... I about died. Like leave it to him to write that sort of thing. 

Next was Minho who had a single girl in front of him. Gave me enough time to find his page to sign. 

I handed him the book and he immediately tried to read my name. He got it a little wonky so I said it correctly and he repeated it with the biggest smile. As he started to sign I asked for the first impression thing. Minho laughed and then slowed his signing, looking up at me slyly through his lashes. He kept doing that while slowly writing. Then he sat up with a smile and said thank you for coming and handed me my book. But he kept holding eye contact... He didn't want to let me go. He did that with everyone, he just like refused to lose a second with you before he had to. 

He is so damn handsome and when he was giving me those looks I swear my heart stopped multiple times. His hair was perfectly styled and his eyes were so mischievous. He looked at me like I was the most interesting thing he'd ever seen. It was really nerve-wracking. He ended up writing ""thank you"" and a word no one could figure out at first. Turns out he wrote that I was mysterious in an intriguing way (the word means strange but the connotations are what I said above and it's quite complimentary apparently). 

Last was Jonghyun. My ultimate and the scariest to many Shawols. He was in a decent mood. Not as good as his solo fansigns but better than some other group ones. It seemed promising. 

I give him my album and ask him to write his impressions of me. He smiled and nodded. Then I launched into my second part. 

He looked up, and [locked eyes]( https://imgur.com/9RYQoCk). I told him I'd be seeing him again next Saturday. That at his concert, I'd be in standing so to please go easy on me. He laughed and I continued with ""please don't give me a nosebleed"" (my goal was to say like ""please don't kill me but this is a phrase in Korean that has same meaning essentially). He busted out laughing and shook his head at me cause I'd gotten really red while saying it. Then he said"" hmm first impressions"" and leaned back and stared. SHINee Tiger in the jungle 2.0. Then he smiled and started writing. He wrote on two pages. He said ""next week"" laughed and sent me on my way. He had written ""your hair suits you and you smile broadly"". 

All in all I'm quite happy with the fansign. It was easy and comfortable and I had a good moment with each member and have strange and sweet things written in my photobooks which is exactly what I wanted. As always SHINee does not disappoint.

For instance, a favourite of mine is when BBC's created a fan video that was shown during [Block B's Very Good showcase] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roBppvYUMP8), which made the members very emotional. 

I also was pleasantly surprised by the intensity of the fanchants during Mamamoo's [first Decalcomanie stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFp1zmytR6U), it really shows how much the fandom had grown since their Melting promotions.

Alternate title: u/jolaurence died.

Okay, let's do this. 

I was freaking out. Literally freaking out in the inside but outside tried to act cool. The boys arrived around 6:20 pm wearing what they wore for MuCore, [JUST LET US LIVE] and the fan sign started then. Jonghyun said some things, they all sat down, and the first person went. 

Order of members from left to right: 

* Onew
* Key
* Taemin
* Minho
* Jonghyun

My spot was directly in sight of Jonghyun. The first person went (it was a young male Shawol and hearts literally went awwww) and he started with Jonghyun but after that they made everyone start with Onew. 

Onew went pretty quick with his signings as did Minho and Jonghyun. Key had a little line that went by fast after a while. Taemin though. He was basically writing essays and since he was in the middle, Minho and Jonghyun killed time a lot. Jonghyun kept trading his drinks for Minho's. So cute. They also ended up singing along to the songs as they waited. 

It was during one of these downtimes when Jonghyun was singing and I was mouthing along to what I know while looking and I swear he like looked into my soul. Like literally. Our eyes locked. I felt my body sink. I was sitting. 

Anyway, it finally got to being my turn to go down so as I was walking past all of the bags on the ground I acted like I was on a balance beam because I needed to find my chill. I had been rehearsing what I wanted to say over and over again. As I was waiting in line to start, Minho was waiting for Taemin to get done signing (this child) and he looked at me. Then he winked. And then I turned my head because nope. CAN YOU NOT??? And then it finally began.

**First up: [Onew](http://i.imgur.com/Y7YRYYD.jpg)**

I said ""hello"" and handed him my booklet and he said my name perfectly (it as one of the most beautiful things to ever happen to me). As he was signing I said ""    "" which basically translates to me pretty much thanking him for being a great leader. BECAUSE HE IS. He said ""thank you"" and I said ""I love you"" [in Korean] and his smile. OH GOD HIS SMILE. HIS SMILE IS WHY I HAVE HOPE IN THE WORLD STILL.

**Second: [Key](http://i.imgur.com/JWrRjC5.jpg)**

This was easy for me since it was in English. He said my name and I told him I went to the Chicago fan meet. 

**K:** ""Are you from Chicago?"" 

**M:** ""No. I'm from Wisconsin.""

**K:** ""How far is that?""

**M:** ""Four hours. I took the train.""

I then thanked him for SHINee bringing me out of a few dark places. He said ""Thank you."" We then talked about ""In the Heights"" since I mentioned I was excited to see it. I then told him that I have the show memorized in English and Spanish since I'm a HUGE Lin-Manuel Miranda fan. [Side note: GO SEE MOANA.] 

**K:** Have you seen it before in America?

**M:** No. This is my first time seeing it.

**K:** You'll like it. It's a fun show.

And then it ended. I basically spent a minute with Key. It was wonderful. 

**Middle: [Taemin](http://i.imgur.com/FeHP5J4.jpg)**

I waited in line for him since he was taking his time and the security guards literally kept an eye on time. Once you finished, you were done. So I get up to Taemin and say ""hello"" and he says my name (also done really attractively) and starts signing. As he signed, I said the following: ""    ."" 

Taemin looked up at me and I said it again. I was telling him that I prefer him over my younger brother in Korean. Then I explained in English ""Brother. Taemin. Same birthday."" AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH THIS ""WHAT THE REALLY???"" FACE AND I BASICALLY DIED INSIDE. 

**T:** Same!?!

**M:** Ne. Same. 

SO HE WROTE SAME DOWN IN MY BOOK. THIS CHILD. WE MUST PROTECT THIS CHILD. 

I said good-bye and then moved on to my original bias in the group, Minho.

**Fourth: [Minho](http://i.imgur.com/fKj0skE.jpg)**

Minho was my first bias in the group and dragged me into this wonderful world. So I went up to him and said ""hello"" and he said my name (SO ATTRACTIVELY OH MY GOD THIS IS MY NEW AESTHETIC). As he signed I said ""   "" which essentially translates to me saying that I expect a drama from him since his drama debuts soon. He smiled and said ""thank you"" in Korean and then.

**M:** Where are you from? 

Choi Minho just broke out the English. 

Choi Minho just spoke to me in English.

I felt weak.

**Me:** Wisconsin. Green Bay Packers. Chicago.

I went with Chicago because that is what all of us do back home when no one knows your town in Wisconsin. We just say Chicago. 

**M:** Chicago. Nice. Thank you. Bye-bye. 

I said bye and started walking away and then he said slightly shy ""see you."" 

OH MY GOD CHOI MINHO. OH MY *GOD*.

And then BAM! Jonghyun time! Literally no time to recover. 

**End: [Jonghyun](http://i.imgur.com/02ILowo.jpg)**

Here we have it folks. The moment of truth. 3 years of having this one as my co-UB with Jung Yonghwa. Finally meeting him. Pictures do not do justice to how beautiful Kim Jonghyun is. He is just...he's his own league.

Anyway, I gave him my book and he said my name also very attractively and as he signed I said ""   "" which basically translates to ""You're my greatest"" so aka ultimate bias. BUT I COULDN'T SAY IT RIGHT AT ALL. So i said it again and Jonghyun still couldn't understand. So I literally yelled at myself with my hands and he sat up a little taller and I said it again. Finally he understood it and said thank you. I then I said ""I love you"" and then it was over. But more importantly, there is [pictorial evidence of this meeting](https://twitter.com/DMB_JT/status/802475298113454080). [This](http://i.imgur.com/SdMwhXO.jpg) is when Jonghyun sat up a little more. I'm fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine. 

I sent a message to my friend back in the states while I was heading home and they told me that ""it's okay if you fucked up Jonghyun. I'm sure he was able to understand you."" They also told me that I got the puppy dog head tilt. [I'm currently digging my grave.]

I walked back to my seat, sat down and started breathing again. While waiting for the fan sign to finish, Minho waved towards us again. I was also singing along because that is what one does. Tell Me What to Do started playing and I was mouthing along and Jonghyun looked up and saw me do it. Remember: I was in eye contact central. WHY KPOP GODS WHY?????

Since Taemin STILL had a long line, people from the sides were shouting at Minho. Then he dabbed and everyone started laughing. He then apologized. When Onew and Key finished, they were given two mics and they started talking about promotions being over and that they had an early wake up call for Inki the next day. Fans told Key that they loved him and he said that he loved them back. Minho asked ""what about me?"" so a mic was given to Minho and he and Onew exchanged ""I love you""s and boy did my heart melt. 

Onew also sang   (Don't Let Me Go) and my heart melted. LEE JINKI IS SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS. When Taemin finally finished everyone clapped and he was acting like nothing at all was out of the ordinary. He also had a hole in his jacket.

Then, Minho and Jonghyun finished their signings and that was it. The end. Jonghyun received a mic and said some words. They all said ""thank you"" and left. 

First ever fan sign done. It was wonderful and amazing. I wouldn't have traded it for the world. Next up: Super Seoul Dream Concert. [edit: working on that right now]",4,48

Wow wow wow wow is all I can say right now. This has probably been one of the most unique experiences I've had at a multi-group kpop concert. Here goes:   
   
*  I arrived at the venue at around 12:30, ticket pickup for the group I purchased mine from was at 1. They placed me right next to the right side of the small stage.... AKA where the idols were coming and going off for their performances. I was about 20 ft from the stage.    
   
* Pentagon were first up, so they came out about ten minutes before the show started and just... Waited for their cue. My row was filled with SM stans (ay shoutout to /u/jolaurence) who were trying to get Jino's attention hahaa. They were super sweet, lots of fanservice, lots of shouting of !! They also bowed to SF9, they crossed paths when they were switching stages.   
   
* Really impressed with all the rookie boys. Man, can they dance. Astro stole my heart, they're so cute.   
   
* The loudest group of fans by FAR were the Carats tonight. Kudos to them. Shawols and Melodies were really loud too, and Starlights were great when it was VIXX's turn.   
   
* Speaking of Seventeen... Those boys. So energetic. They really hyped up the crowd. Joshua, Jeonghan and DK all made eye contact with me and waved a lot. S.Coups was so..... I don't even know. He was pretty turnt, mad energy from him hahaha   
   
* There was a point where Twice was waiting to go on stage. I waved to Jeongyeon and Momo (my biases), but they didn't have much of a reaction. Actually Momo and Sana kinda gave me a weird look. But... They're tired, they're performing a lot, I'm not holding it against them. Dahyun's smile could light up a room, she waved and pumped her fist at us when we they were going up on stage.   
   
* I got distracted when VIXX came on the stage... And then got even more distracted because I glanced over *and Daehyun from B.A.P was staring at me holy crap I WAS NOT PREPARED*. He smirked. I died. Zelo was crouching down half the time, but he turned around at one point and saw me gazing (he's been my bias since debut). He locked eyes with me and sang/mouthed a line of VIXX's new song, I gave him a thumbs up, he grinned. NICE. They were super sweet and friendly when they came off stage, too - They all waved and grinned at our section.   

* NCT 127... Mark's kilt is everything, and Yuta definitely has a new chin and that makes me really sad.   
      
* This was my first time seeing AOA! ~~Yuna (I think? Correct me if I'm wrong, black hair with a topknot today)~~ Chanmi waved right at me and my friend during Heart Attack. Those girls are beautiful.   
   
* EXID... Jeonghwa winked directly at me. I don't think I'll ever recover.   
   
* My friend had a really cute moment with Peniel of BtoB. She's only recently gotten into them, Peniel drew her in. So he was on our side of the stage for most of the night. At one point she got his attention, and she motioned around her whole head and gave him a thumbs up and mouthed ""so handsome"". HIS GRIN WAS THE CUTEST THING. BtoB were also super sweet - Minhyuk was watching our section quite closely, and they all waved and bowed at us as they left the stage. Eunkwang was spinning and throwing hearts. Also, I'm a big fan of Ilhoon's bun.    
   
* T-ARA fans are super intense. A fancammer jumped in front of me to film them and she got kicked out, well, basically dragged out. She wouldn't leave. Actually at one point she used my thigh to prop herself up. Boram looks like a little doll.   
   
* SHINee. SHINee, SHINee, SHINee, my co-bias group. Key is my ultimate bias. We made eye contact. He waved. He acknowledged my existence. I wasn't ready. He's so beautiful... Ahhh, but they all looked so damn good today. Also got mad fanservice from Minho - he's literally the happiest child, all waves and grins.  Taemin and Jjong also smiled and waved at me. Wasn't lucky with Onew, but he didn't come really near by me at any time.   
   
I have to work in the morning so I should go collapse in bed now. I'll see if I remember any more in the morning and edit accordingly!! Seriously, if you get a chance - GO to one of these massive concerts. The energy is always so good. ",24,42
1980,2016-11-28,2016,11,28,0,5f5ulb,[FAN ACCOUNT] 161127 Super Seoul Dream Concert 2016,jolaurence,1480261537,"This account is gonna be slightly short on the girl groups. I'm sorry folks. My brain was all over the place at the concert. I'm also forgetting a few groups because I don't remember what order they were in? 

My seat was on the ground and it was really good because it was right by the middle stage and I got to see a lot of the groups enter that way or leave that way. I was also by the end so that meant INTERACTION! Also, my row was basically a line of Shawols with one AROHA next to me. We all had a fun time. While waiting for the concert to begin, we saw the first group walk by towards the stage and it was Pentagon. Insert a row of SM followers freaking out because JINO FINALLY DEBUTED! JINO IS FREE! We then also talked about Johnny and Hansol and Kun all needing to be debuted soon. I made the point of Johnny being so multi-talented that there isn't a group ready for him to join. 

BACK ON TOPIC!

Pentagon performed and they were really good. I enjoyed their stage. KNK ws next and they were good. As KNK were performing, SF9 walked towards the stage so I got to see them and made eye contact with a few. I wasn't able to get Rowoon though. HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL IRL! But Zuho! OH MY WORD! Zuho is just godly. SF9 went on stage and did Fanfare and I was doing the fan chant. I'm bummed they didn't do K.O. because that song is so lit and the opening choreo. Y'ALL. Rowoon also had some of the members crouch down for people taking pictures. THIS ANGEL. When they left the stage. they were waving and bowing the entire time. MY HEART.

I believe Oh My Girl performed next but I can't remember anymore because all of a sudden I saw ASTRO! Fellow AROHA and I basically tried our hardest for them to look at us. And they did. We made eye contact with Eun Woo and waved a lot. For a split second Rocky looked like Jonghyun from the side and my heart literally dropped. Will have to keep an eye out on that kid because I will not be okay in a few years if he keeps this up. Ahem. Anyways. While they were waiting to go on, I caught Sanha's eye and gave him a heart. AND THEN HE GAVE ME ONE BACK. NOONA DOWN. NOONA DOWN! Then I gave Eun Woo a thumbs up.  

AROHA next to me was taking pictures so she gave me her banner and light stick to support them. They did so good! I'm so proud of my little babies! And I noticed a few things I haven't noticed before in the choreo. Instead of ending Confession like they usually do they suddenly started doing Polaris and I was not prepared at all. At the end, they all did these little faces and poises and it was so memeworthy. I love these dorks. The lights went down and they started to leave but their mics were still on so we heard them laugh. STAN THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE!

Now is the part where I really can't remember most of the concert so I'm using the notes that I took down. Like I said, sorry about the girl groups being low. I literally could not focus on any of them for the first time in my life. 

NCT 127 came out and I counted 7 members and a part of me went ""Johnny isn't joining them. Yet. Oh boy."" Once again, their outfits were just hideous. The people behind me were talking about it. Trust me. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THEY WEAR HIDEOUS THINGS. WE WANT IT FIXED TOO. This was my first time seeing NCT 127. I've seen NCT Babies I mean NCT Dream in September at a different festival. Mark though. My boy! 

This is what I wrote down for Seventeen: Vernon is so hot. 

So when Seventeen came on, I literally died. Just died. They did Very Nice and Mansae. Once again, Very Nice is basically death for fangirls. All of the boys look so good. RIP Carats on December 5. They walked by us towards the end of the song and naturally I was like ""VERNON I LOVE YOU!"" We were also yelling at Hoshi and waving our SHINee light sticks at him. You know Hoshi was fanboying that SHINee was there. They ended the song and then made a loud noise and Vernon's face. He was Hansol at that moment. A living meme. They then talked about their comeback and mentioned they were doing Mansae. Mansae is still one of the best songs OF ALL TIME! Love these dorks. And Vernon was just straight up fire. THIS BOY IS GONNA END ME ONE DAY. When they finished, I was literally clutching the chair in front of me screaming in emotional pain. 

AOA basically slayed me once again as did EXID. TWICE is literally a darling group. Just...so wonderful. They did TT and Cheer Up and the noise level during Cheer Up. Lordy. Red Velvet was also really good. They performed Russian Roulette and Dumb Dumb. I miss you Yeri. GFriend was good as well. 

VIXX pretty much slayed as usual. Concept kings. Just wow. Also Starlights. My god. The fanchants were so loud. SOOOOOOOOOOOOO loud. Also Ravi. You need to be stopped but don't stop. 

B.A.P was pretty much art. They performed their entire set by us and the choreo was just incredible. Skydive is such a good song. I love it. ART I TELL YOU. ART. 

BTOB went after that and Peniel my darling! You can tell he is feeling more confident after announcing his hair loss. My heart was literally swelling up over him. The fanchants from Melody were really loud as well. Impressed. They finished, MCs started talking, and I looked towards the main stage and they started setting it up for THEM.

Little back story: the whole reason I got into kpop was through the kdrama You're Beautiful. Honggi and my co-UB, Yonghwa, were in that drama. 

FT Island started setting up and you could tell it was going to be live. And I mean LIVE. They were going to be playing their instruments. I started screaming right away. I was yelling out Minari at the top of my lungs. My friend a few chairs down was like ""holy lungs girl!"" I HAVE NO SHAME FOR MY LOVE OF FT ISLAND AND MINARI! The boys came out and started messing around with their guitars and that was when Honggi said ""We're doing this live"" in Korean and I screamed again. I screamed a lot. It was an honest to god hard rock concert. Best 10 mins of my life. They did Take Me Now and Pray. I was screaming the lyrics at the top of my lungs for both. I also yelled ""Minari"" when they were leaving really loud. I HAVE NO SHAME.

Finally, it was time for SHINee. My brain was still a mess from Saturday. Actually, it will be a mess for the rest of my life. Our row was ready. SHINee came out and my heart stopped. They looked so good and they were walking this ""we are here to destroy you all"" walk. Well they accomplished that the moment Tell Me What To Do began. The choreography. The outfits. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SONG IS LITERALLY SEXY. It was my first time seeing it performed live as well and oh god. My heart was weak. So weak. Send help. Literally send help. 

After Tell Me What To Do ended, they greeted us and then started walking towards where we were sitting. There was eye contact and waving galore. They then mentioned they were going to do 1 of 1. OKAY LET'S DO THIS BOYS! During the song, we were able to get some eye contact from the members. My friend got eye contact with her UB. 1 of 1 is so good. I love it. I just love SHINee. I really do. They finished the song and that was the end of the concert. They waved at us and Jonghyun stopped and had this look in his eye that said ""why is there something familiar so close by?"" You see nothing, Jon Snow. There might have been a little eye contact. 

Overall, the night was fun. It was pretty good. Now I'm dead tired and I have 5 days to prepare for Jonghyun's concert. ",12,37

1990,2016-11-28,2016,11,28,4,5f74as,K-pop fashion and trying understand its elements?,arya16mm,1480276257,"Hello! :)

So, I was scouring the internet for fashion advice, specifically Korean/kpop styles, because I am currently obsessed with everything the guys wear. (I am a girl but yeah, the guy's styles appeal to me way more). And I realized that with my untrained eye, I can't really spot the style, if that makes sense. The details, the elements. So when I try going out shopping, it never really works out the way I want it to, never really finding the right things. 

I live in Toronto, and there are quite a few Koreans living here, some following the Korean trends/styles, others not. But I am in general a huge fan of the stylishness and their unique attire, which I never seem to find anywhere at malls. So I guess my question has several branches. 

Are there any websites or blogs on this topic that I don't know of, that give fashion advice and so on? Anyone living in Toronto who is Korean or knows where to buy those kinds of clothes/accessories? What brands, etc? Or any online shops? I know of Yesstyle, but outside of that, not really anything legit. I know there isn't some specific hidden ""Korean fashion shop"" but it would be cool to get hints at where they generally do their shopping. XD

An example of what I mean is the huge explosion of the use of cloth, rather thick/velvety/glossy chokers recently, with deep plunging v-line necks or no shirt at all, and these beautiful velvety, flowery blazers. Seen many groups wearing these and I found chokers similar to them at Forever 21 (only place I could find them). 

Some other elements that confuse me are the shoes, because I can't quite pin down the styles, as well as accessories like bags and jewelry. I know that there are several styles within, some leaning towards streetwear, etc. so if anyone has some sort of summary/clues for each style they've noticed, that would be cool too. 

Excuse the confused rambling. Hope you could understand what I'm trying to say! 





**EDIT**: *Thanks everyone for your contributions.  I know it's difficult to give a concrete answer, but I think the solution would be some sort of blog, tumblr or subreddit that is dedicated to, rather than pinpointing exactly what the idol is wearing, pointing people towards more accessible (and affordable) alternatives that are inspired by the look, rather than matching it exactly. 
Speaking of which, if anyone knows where I can find those snapbacks or hats with the piercings for a kind of affordable price, do tell me. In addition to that, BTS' Park Jimin's recent style, both outside and on stage, I've been intrigued by. The silver hair (not sure of the exact color), contacts (they look realistic, all I have are those super huge dolly fake ones, since I have super dark brown eyes and it's hard to see any color on them), and the piercings on his ears (the little cross thing etc). If you guys have any clues to point me in the right direction, that would be awesome.* ",72,93

For me, it would have to be Shannon Williams. I found out about her by various clips on youtube where she appeared on Korean singing shows and did a cover of an IU song. Then it was announced that she would release an album and I heard ""Why Why"" and I was instantly sold. I preordered the album and when it came I listened to it and liked EVERY SONG. That's pretty rare because a lot of albums have filler songs that I tend to always skip. I loved that she was a foreigner in the Korean music industry... this was before TWICE, a time where we only had examples like Chocolat. I really admire her for having such a powerful voice, being able to release an album as a solo singer, and thrive in Korea.

...and then it just fizzled out. She had the minor controversy where she said some dumb things on some stream, but I honestly believe that even without this ""scandal"" she still wasn't being considered for a second album. She had so much potential, released an album that I thought was amazing, but either her company didn't think she was marketable enough for a second album or Korea didn't really like her or whatever... I can't say for sure what the real reasons were, but I'm super disappointed she didn't become the next big thing. :(",160,99

Hey /r/kpop! So I've been keeping track of artists who debuted this year and I thought it would be a good idea to share the list with you all. I hope this helps you find new music that fits your taste. Some small things that I would like to note: this list does not contain soloists or subunits of previously debuted groups, most pictures will show only the current line-ups of the groups. I will be adding more of these in the next few weeks, all the way until the December releases, then I will restart for 2017. Also, if there are any rookies from 2015 who did not have a music video when they debuted, I will be including them here as special mentions if their first MV was released this year. I tried to gather all of the debuts, but if I leave any out please let me know.
 
**Note:** If anybody wants Facebook/Twitter/Instagram information about any of the artists, PM me and Ill send you what I have. I follow most of them on Instagram and I have a lot of Facebooks and Twitter accounts listed so it shouldnt be too hard.
 
**Female Artists**


[Awesome Day, duo] (http://imgur.com/J32PwVD)

*Company:* independent


*Members:* Yoon Hayoon, Esther


*Genre:* Indie


Indie duo Awesome Day debuted with [Go Away] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjOKbuzrIVM), a song that I wish existed a few years ago because there are a few people who Id like to sing this song too. In May, they returned with mini-album For, which featured the songs [Breath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBFP1UO1GO4) and [Maybe We Are] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xxb9hIHq_Y).


[BABA, group] (http://imgur.com/ZLsG0Ua) *special mention*

*Company:* PR Entertainment


*Concept:* Hip Thrusts


*Members:* Saei, Jinri, SeoAe, Seoli, Pureum


BABA actually debuted in 2015 with military-themed [Kim Sang Sa Returning from Vietnam] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FraIFyuFnb0), a song with choreo featuring violent hip thrusts(in your face Hani). This year they released their first music video for their second single [Catch Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uX5ldnyv8Y), a song where they revived their hip thrusts but added in a quirky/flair and a creepy ice cream cone. It even has a [dance practice] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ublayOLIl8E)! If you start to like BABA, keep in mind that they are good for removing members named Somi (Thai Somi was bias until her visa ran out, I never paid attention to Korean Somi).




[Bloomy, group] (http://imgur.com/zIqRm8D)

*Company:* DS Entertainment


*Concept:* Cute, Dance


*Members:*  Seoyeon, Yeonji, Gunyoung, Jiyun


I reallly hope this group blows up in the future because whenever I listen to [Because of You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_tdFnDHbJk), I can hear the potential flowing through my ears. That, and I think Jiyun is adorable. Bloomy debuted with two songs, [Because of You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGehoJdQdzU) and [Heungchitbbung] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL5LIs8H2s0). Warning: They are under the same company that the very, very, *very* promising boy group A6P was in. Do I have to say any more?


[Double B, duo] (http://imgur.com/mYRtAgz)

*Company:* N Entertainment


*Concept:* Dance Ballad


*Members:* Hyunji, Jaehui


Aside from the heinous photoshop that is present in most of their pictures, I dont know how to describe Double B. Their debut single is [Insomnia] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7V_2BWfPZQ), but their B-side, [Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fAb6_G8jQY) has a music video that I havent fully watched yet.


[Grace, soloist] (http://imgur.com/dWOEU3v)

*Company:* YYAC


*Genre:* Grace is a genre


I think at this point everyone who knows of Grace loves her for one thing or another. She debuted with [Im Fine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT_jL5rRxW8) (which had the best teaser trailer ever and eventually participated in Mnets Unpretty Rapstar Volume 3. She came back during holiday season with dance-y single [Trick or Treat] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kIcVvDgMq0).


[Kali, soloist] (http://imgur.com/nhKMTf5)

*Company:* Take5 Entertainment


*Genre:* Rap/Hip-Hop


I havent found much information about Kali as of yet, but I was acquainted with her debut single, [I Am] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w9TTL0Z994), in the same way that many other listeners were: [Yoon Seohyung] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFuNZIJPkJg). If you have not watched PD101 and have no clue who vocal empress Seohyung is, then get out(nah, Im joking). But seriously, this is a cool song that I might have skipped over is YSH wasnt in it. I glad I didnt though, its a cool song.


[Li.G, soloist] (http://imgur.com/SC7OdSj)

*Company:* Daebak Entertainment


*Genre:* Rap/Hip-Hop


Li.G debuted with [This is This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNlbR7hq1kA) in February, and followed up in March with [Puzzle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wcbds_Hh_Q). It was her third single, [Spring Again] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZOZtWKTLgc) that made me care and want to hear more.


[Merry Sweet Cafe, duo] (http://imgur.com/5glH5Xp)

*Company:* Mango Music


*Members:* Lim Sweet, Kim Merry


*Genre:* Indie


I dont know what I like more about this: their music or the fact that the members names or Merry and Sweet...Ill figure it out later. What matters now is that you stop what youre doing and go listen to Merry Sweet Cafe right now. They debuted with [Winter, Spring] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIj9YXfHDRE), and have since released a number of singles: [Merry Sweet Cafe] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ-Z4zwzdbg), [] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4o1lgmTows), and [Faded at Dawn] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnR3lAOFuFY).


[Tae Hwa, soloist] (http://imgur.com/XEzI0QR)

*Company:* Creativist


*Genre:* Trot


I think Tae Hwas title track is called [Love Like X] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbbnwRVA1vE). It comes complete with a ballroom-themed music video and everything.


[Wable,sister duo] (http://imgur.com/at3fDQt)

*Company:* MMO Entertainment


*Members:* Kirim, Pureum


*Genre:* Pop Ballad, Indie-ish


Wable is one of the most impressive duos to debut this year, and the fact that they are sisters is a bonu(fun fact: their name stands for White Black). Their music offers me relaxation and happiness. They made their official debut with [I Want to Fall in Love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLpoj0gwRyc), and followed up with [Wind Petals] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaFAL3NHo2Q) in June. [Heres] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i4oONzxOQI) them with Ian singing a cover of Crush and Taeyeons Dont Forget.


[WJSN/Cosmic Girls, group] (http://imgur.com/uXWJ1n6)

*Company:* Starship Entertainment / YUEHUA Entertainment


*Concept:* Cosmic Girls(literally)


*Members:* Dawon, Eunseo, Exy, Xuan Yi, Yeonjung, Seola, Bona, Cheng Xiao, Mei Qi, Soobin, Yeoreum, Dayoung, Luda


Cosmic Girls debuted with a whopping 12 members, and added Yoo Yeunjung(another much beloved vocalist) following her PD101/I.O.I. success. WJSN stands for the names of the four sub-units: Wonder, Joy, Sweet and Natural. They had a very solid debut mini-album, featuring [MoMoMo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRJqH0Plqg8) and [Catch Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLwAAhhXBo), but it wasnt until their first comeback, [Secret] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w), that I decided to take an active interest in them. I tell you, that song changed my life. When Im in a supermarket and my music is on shuffle and Secret comes on, *I can feel the cosmo inside of me*. I was introduced to the group because I followed Exy(hopelessly) after she was unjustly booted on UPRS Volume 2. 


**Male Artists**


[APL, group] (http://imgur.com/rOCIwLj)

*Company:* Dam Entertainment


*Concept:* Dance


*Members:* Hyuk, Seoin, TIN, J-No


APL is the brother group of the girl group that tries, Switch. TIN is formerly a member of Touch. They debuted with Might Just Die(heres the [Korean Drama Version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70nwF0BclFo), the [Korean dance version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoHTtx51-0I) and the [Chinese Drama version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHoNvaJEcI), and the [Chinese dance version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVEpCaJK1RE)). That was tiring.


[ASTRO, group] (http://imgur.com/gT1sho7)

*Company:* Fantagio Entertainment


*Concept:* Cute, Seasonal


*Members:* Sanha, MJ, Eunwoo, Moonbin, Rocky, JinJin


Astro debuted with the spring-themed [Hide&amp;Seek] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEgSjGQEZnM)! Their summer release [Breathless] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBNyHAasnSM) was one the best music videos of the year(and not just because of Yoojung). Most recently, they came back with [Confession] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuAm9KH2dkY) (the MV featured PD101 alum Lee Seojeong, who left LOUDers and will probably debut with Yoojung and Doyeon next year)Astro is one of the first groups in a long time that uses concepts that have never been done(how many soda bottle concepts have you seen). Astro has the potential to be a monster boy group, they just need the right attention. All of their concepts so far have been seasonal and youthful, but they have the potential to pull off a darker concept and Im just waiting for it. Patiently.


[Deepercent, group] (http://imgur.com/IBKH96i)

*Company:* Deeper Record


*Members:* MC Hansai, Classico, Jinade, Kisper, Song G


*Genre:* Rap/Hip-Hop


Deepercent is a project group made of all five of Deeper Records artists, some of which have been out for a long time. In February, they released the single [Rich] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI6Pu0jKeYw).


[ESBEE, soloist] (http://imgur.com/Co3lTrH)

*Company:* Brand New Music


*Genre:* R&amp;B


One day Im gonna find this man and marry his voice. Either that, or Im going to ask him to introduce me to Verbal Jint. Id be okay with either. Anyways, ESBEE debuted with [I Just Wanna Sing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIU7hWRjOMU), featuring Hanhae and Verbal Jint eating pizza. Since then he has also released [Sparkling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dclS8v3OOEg) and [Now and Forever] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mruAAGt53h4).


[Grey Day, group] (http://imgur.com/Mn4eQOG)

*Company:* Just Listen Musiq Company


*Members:* The GitA, Hyunwook, Park Gihwan


*Genre:* R&amp;B


Grey Day debuted with [Someone Calls Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcHs7XdiFAc) and have since released consistently good music. Their second single, [I Just Wanna] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVRO0dOpG44) featured Wassups Nada. Their third release was an album entitled [Permeate] (http://www.mnet.com/album/534338), and most recently they released single [2:30] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdE4ah5K0ak). All of their songs and some other goodies can be found on their official [Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKoqUBtnYLqtoc1UjXD2kg/featured).


[KimB, soloist] (http://imgur.com/Tx8zjCr)

*Company:* B Music	


*Genre:* Ballad


When KimB(or B Kim) debuted he released his title track [Love Sick] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cgp6lNj56s) along with a music video for his B-side, [Feels So Good] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18McKfQGSRE). He subsequently released [In My Memories] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWsjY6xe8RU) (feat. Douner), [Youre Like the Moon] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYsKlzu6t8) (feat.

2087,2016-11-29,2016,11,29,3,5fd7ai,[Media] Made 5 new wallpapers,NevilleTomaGuaro,1480356938,"A couple of days ago I posted some wallpapers for mobile to this sub that I had made, and overall it seemed that the feedback was universally positive. As a result I asked you guys to tell me some groups youd like wallpapers for, and heres the first result of that in what Ill be calling:


Wallpaper Takeover


For this edition the featured groups are: BTS, SISTAR, f(x), EXID, Lovelyz (yes I know that one was already posted but most people probably haven't seen it) and I.O.I.


The original users that requested these are:


/u/TaeyeonTiffany for Lovelyz
/u/AlphaBaby for BTS
/u/Ace245 for I.O.I
/u/Kiiid Exid
/u/AZUR3WRATH for SISTAR
/u/neemblast for f(x)


Originally I planned to have an EXO one done for today but I kinda fucked it up so it will be in the next installment of this series (or whatever this goofy shit is called).


If you just want the wallpapers the link is down below, however if youre interested on how I did each one individually Ill have a detailed account in the comments later today.


Thank you all very much for the feedback on the last post! If theres anything I could ask is that if you do in fact download any of these and actually set it as your phone wallpaper, you let me know either through a comment or a PM as the fact that anyone would have ANYTHING I made as the first thing they see in their phone would be mind blowing to me.

It makes sense, just like how YG wanted Bigbang to make a huge wave in the industry. Or how Girls' Generation really brought the idea of a successful girl group to a whole other level. 

I respect all kpop groups, but I am still confused as to how agency CEOs came up with names such as Red Velvet or Blackpink. (I am a Blackpink fan, but I'm still warming up to the name lol) What are your thoughts on popular groups' names, past and present, that might make a non-kpop fan give you a look?",148,96
