1,2015-11-1,2015,11,1,9,3r14ws,[Meta] How to handle mass posts in this sub,VV1K,1446338828,"[We need to talk about this](http://i.imgur.com/EfLrWv1.png). 

How should this be handled? I feel like the sub is divided but we should make a rule and stick by it to be consistent. 

Personally, I hate it. There's no point to it. I don't need to see 6 vixx comeback photos on the front of this pretty small sub, even more so because they were submitted probably a few minutes apart. I get it, they're having a comeback. Make a self post instead and link them all, at the very least that keeps it organized. 

But that also brings another thing to question: what should happen if there is a staggered release for teaser photos or mv teasers? I would say that would warrant a new post.

51,2015-11-2,2015,11,2,9,3r5daw,I've come to appreciate /r/kpop more,FlashParadox,1446424492,"As someone who's been into kpop since '09 my first real interactions with other people of the same interest stemmed from Twitter. Granted, I was also kinda like a kid at the time I suppose my mindset fit in with most of them as well. But I never really got too deep. Never got involved with drama or fanwars. Much. Aha. But just last night I tweeted how I felt about iKON and Rookie of the Year. Imagine my surprise when someone as unnoticed as me suddenly had my mentions flooded with angry fans(ikonics?) telling me to shut up, asking who else deserved the award etcetc. That said, there were some who (I'm assuming) took my tweet with humor and I think one person who tried to explain with civility and facts. But my point is: I feel like /r/kpop is a more mature place where one can state their opinion and discuss it compared to Twitter. Being able to discuss and not completely pitchfork an (un)popular view of things is something I have a new found thankfulness for. I think I have the community here to thank that for. So, thank you everyone. 

Also, shoutouts to /u/4minutesleft and /UsagiTempo cos you two rock.

tl ; dr: Reddit &gt; Twitter.

UPDATE: Twitter iKONics still won't let it rest. At this point I might ignore twitter altogether now.

UPDATE 2: Shitstorm has died down. Thank you for all the support/discussion points guys!",126,117

I'm Billy from [GO! Billy Korean](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoBillyKorean) on YouTube.

Last year (and with many of your guys' help), we created two books for learning Korean - ""Korean Made Simple"" and ""Korean Made Simple 2."" Those went great. Since then I've been hard at work on the 3rd and final installment in the series - ""Korean Made Simple 3: Continuing your journey of learning the Korean language."" 

Today I just launched the Kickstarter project for the 3rd book. You can check it out here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-3-continuing-your-journey-in-ko](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-3-continuing-your-journey-in-ko)

I know that one of the #1 reasons that people start learning Korean is for K-pop (... and/or Korean guys and girls). If I hadn't gotten into Korean through learning Japanese first, I probably would've later for some of the Korean music I was exposed to.

I'm here to answer any questions, not just about the project, but also any Korean questions and K-pop related questions :-) For the record, my favorite K-pop singer is and always will be  (fight me if you disagree), but I also have a lot of #2s. AMA~!

**edit**: I think I should also add some more K-pop related stuff to this post, so I want to share my new favorite Davichi song (I actually had never heard any Davichi songs I think until just an hour ago) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16IBYTH3fLw (""  "") Sorry if it's not your favorite song of theirs, but it just felt really nice to listen to.

Also one of the features of this new book is an appendix on Korean dialects, which might come in handy while watching  (Eunji) speaking Busan dialect in ""Reply 1997"" :P",55,196

Plus, I'm currently listening to Kanye West's Dark Fantasy, the introduction to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (which, by the way, is a great album). So what album intros stand out to you and why? Is it that they preface the album with something really powerful, something that's perfect the way the first sentences of a story set the scene, something that's really lyrically intelligent? I'd like to know. And if you could mention it, I'd like to hear if the rest of the album lived up to how good the intro was.",98,53

Hallyutrend published a very short and dry letter informing the Lima cancellation on their facebook but either they deleted it or made it only available for peru, later on, [this article came out](http://laprensa.peru.com/espectaculos/noticia-4minute-conciertos-lima-hyuna-kpop-54219). The Chile cancellation was not informed by hallyutrend, but [by the ticket vendor](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1004789152911172&amp;set=gm.648037545337278&amp;type=3), again with no explanation besides ""imprevistos"" (something like ""not foreseen"").

The Buenos Aires show is still going to happen, apparently, but this is not a tour anymore and one can infer that it's not gonna be as profitable and maybe they'll plug the thing out altogether.

This is [the second time this company cancels this tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/318n4x/4minute_latin_american_fanbash_postponed/) and the [third time disappointing south american fans.](http://www.allkpop.com/forums/discussion/203135/update-2015-tour-officially-cancelled-b-a-p-live-on-earth-south-america)

We don't even have to talk about kpop, we can talk about whatever (just nothing nsfw please).

What do you guys think? I'd like to make some new friends with similar interests!

I have kik and telegram, PM me if you're interested or if you're comfortable you can leave your username in the comments. Just please say if that username is for kik or telegram.

Also something to note: kik group chats can only go up to 50 people. I don't know the limit for telegram.",19,1

415,2015-11-7,2015,11,7,15,3rv48h,11th Anniversary of JYP Entertainment: Interview with Park Jinyoung,brianabird,1446878818,"**11th Anniversary Since Founding - Park Jin Young's batting eye: ""Being wholesome friends is very good**

From WG band to TWICE's debut... not a businessman but a partner


(Lee Mi-young, Jung Byung-gun reporters) In the domestic music industry, JYP Entertainment's position is very stable. Together with SM Entertainment &amp; YG Entertainment, they are referred to as the Big Three.

Currently, JYP has recruited many actors &amp; can rank with the large multi-talent entertainment agencies. But the mention of JYP is still associated foremost with singers. This is because JYP's chief leader Park Jin Young remains an ""active singer"", &amp; also because JYP Entertainment is a center where pop idols are groomed. It plays a principal role in actively guiding Kpop's main idols.

After stagnating momentarily in recent years, JYP succeeded in ""redeeming their reputation"" in 2015. This was a pre-planned ""counteroffensive."" After 3 years of trial &amp; error, the JYP setup finally landed safely. This year, their singers were dispatched every month via a mass production system, producing notable results.

Miss A's Only You &amp; Park Jin Young's Who's Your Mama competed with each other for the top spot, creating an interesting ""team kill"" scenario. Baek Ayeon became a ""contraflow"" () archetype. WG presented another possibility for girlgroups when they returned with a band concept. 2PM took charge of their own album &amp; attempted to join the ranks of true artists. GOT7 showed us their rapid momentum. DAY6 is gradually gaining a firm foothold. There is also the recently-debuted daebak rookie TWICE, who is likewise leaving an important mark for JYP in 2015.

Park Jin Young's prowess as a musician might have shone brightly, but his contributions as JYP's representative producer in 2015 cannot be overlooked either. Setting aside his status &amp; constantly striving for team achievements, from WG's comeback to TWICE's debut, ""Park Jin Young's first chess move"" was critical. Once hovering over the edge of a cliff, WG would embark on a saga of girlgroup evolution, &amp; they have a worthwhile future to look forward to. After surviving the hail of bullets that was the rookie idol battle, TWICE's debut would garner attention both at home &amp; abroad, &amp; they became the ""new-generation trend.""

Thanks to Park Jin Young's ""batting eye"", TWICE was able to shine brightly. They are born to continue WG's &amp; MissA's lineage as a resolute girlgroup. Asked if he has a special inspiration when it comes to girlgroups, Park Jin Young said: ""Whether guys or girls, being wholesome friends is very good.""

""When guys look at girls, having a wholesome impression is the most important value. Unlike looking at other guys, they will prioritize a sense of integrity when they evaluate [girls]. No matter how good a singer or dancer, if they aren't upright or wholesome, I doubt they can cut it. Such people won't even understand the need to strive hard &amp; make dreams come true. Making money might be important, but the process itself should beget happiness too. I think that's very important. Between skills &amp; personality, if someone's lacking in one, I will work hard to help them consolidate both of these facets. Of course, my dream is to find friends who have both requisites. What's very rare is that TWICE has both the skills &amp; personality requisites. Presently, they haven't even shown one quarter of what they are capable of.""

Asked to ""please contrast TWICE from WG &amp; MissA"", Park Jin Young smiled &amp; said: (TWICE) seems to be the most unruly among the JYP friends. If WG is considered warmhearted &amp; MissA feminine, the (TWICE) friends are like little brats. They are the singers who seem least afraid of me.""

WG's successful comeback also cannot be overlooked. Park Jin Young himself was very supportive of the WG members' fascination with music instruments &amp; of their transformation into a band. Together with representative Jung Wook (JYP CEO), they had begun to hunt for a variety of materials to help WG learn music. Park Jin Young also wrote their title song I Feel You. Having the materials &amp; the spiritual backing gave WG a tremendous boost.

""In learning to play instruments &amp; together as a group, the songwriting aspect would also undergo a change. I have many songwriting friends who cannot play instruments. So they became lyricists or helped at the underscoring (secondary production) level. [My] co-written songs happen mostly because I need a musician to provide an accompaniment before I can compose the melody. Since it (the music) wasn't my initiative, I would require such aptitude &amp; capability. But songwriting as part of a band is quite different. I have told the girls that this would be my last time writing the title song for them. From now on, it's up to them to figure it out themselves, even with whether to live or die. They have become like real sisters to me, so I thought: Rather than give them a fish to feed them for a day, why not teach them to fish to feed them for a lifetime.""

Park Jin Young has complete faith in WG's skills &amp; future.

""The next album is gonna be the real deal. If this time is akin to bracing them as they learn to cycle a bicycle, the next time I'm going to let go. Fortunately, WG is very happy to have become a band. It's time that they rely on their own abilities. They have a lot of ideas, each &amp; every one leaving me astounded. I'm going to send them overseas too, to find &amp; share inspiration with other band musicians. This will help them.""

Park Jin Young's eyes were gleaming as he talked about the JYP singers. Revenue incomes &amp; chart rankings were not sufficient in evaluating a singer's value. Instead, Park Jin Young believes in their potential talent as ""musical companions"". Perhaps therein lies the clout of JYP.

520,2015-11-9,2015,11,9,11,3s33id,[Discuss] Why do K-Pop idol groups feel the need to enter American market?,Ashyne,1447037757,"This is something that has puzzled me for a long time. Why is it that many K-Pop idol groups and their agencies feel the need for them to break into the American music market?

Let's first consider that in America, Asian-Americans are a rare breed in the popular music scene despite the abundance of talented musicians as can be observed through dance covers, song covers and performances uploaded on individual channels on video-sharing sites such as YouTube.

Secondly, K-Pop appeals mainly to Asians, who are a minority in America, due to many similarities between East and Southeast Asian nations such as shared culture, language, fashion styles, beauty ideals and pop music preferences.

Non-Asian fans are a minority; if you visit most K-Pop conventions, events, concerts or performances in America, you will notice that Asians vastly outnumber non-Asians.

Let's take a look at the main reasons why K-Pop appeals more to Asians as well as why it will be extremely difficult to gain a foothold in America:

**1) Language**

Most Americans who are not Asian would prefer to listen to music in their language, although music itself can be enjoyed regardless of whether one understands the lyrics or not.

**2) Culture**

The culture of South Korea is the complete opposite of America's. The formalities and etiquette inherent in the basic Korean lifestyle cannot be compared to the more informal and individualistic culture of America. Cultural differences create a ""me vs you"" prejudice that make it hard for those unaccustomed to the foreign culture to accept, appreciate and understand it.

**3) Beauty Ideals**

This is easily the most visually apparent. Where the American ideal of beauty features and encourages an adult, sensual and seductive look with thick make-up, arched eyebrows and tan skin, South Korea idealizes the pure and innocent appearance with natural-looking and light makeup, pale skin, straight eyebrows and a youthful child-like demeanor.

**4) Fashion Styles**

For the sake of easily-identifiable differentiation, I will refer to female idols. South Korean popular fashion, driven by K-Pop trends and fads, is mainly about looking girly, delicate and youthful. Soft fabrics with pastel colors for the feminine and child-like look on one end of the spectrum (e.g. Apink/Lovelyz) or vibrant eye-catching styles combining a contrast of elements for the more teenage-chic appearance on the other (e.g. 2NE1/T-ara).

The clothes worn by female American soloists or girl groups are inherently revealing, provocative and deliberately meant to portray an adult look permeated with overt sensuality and sexuality.

**5) Choreography**

K-Pop choreography for male idol groups features a more artistic, eye-catching performance with very complex and rapid dance routines than American boy groups, who usually value vocal talent over excessively prominent choreographies.

For female K-Pop idols, choreography is light-hearted and dainty on one end of the spectrum for the cutesy groups, or more sexual and provocative on the other end of the spectrum for groups that feature a sexier concept. This is the only kind of choreography that is similar to, but still easily distinguishable from American female singer-dancers, whose choreography are much more sexually-explicit and vulgar.

**6) Music**

The music between Korean and American idol groups are more similar than the other factors listed above. K-pop idol groups, both male and female, usually sing about innocent romances, first loves, breaking up or love at first sight (teenage topics); while Americans sing about these topics too, they also sing about addictions and more adult topics.

The aforementioned factors are not all, but the main ones that become easily apparent when trying to consider the reasons that K-pop idols will have a difficult time being successful in America.

Let's now look at simplified statistics:

America has a population of around 320 million. Combining the 6 factors listed above and considering that Asians, to whom Asian music (e.g. K-pop) appeal the most, are the minority of the population, we have a tiny fraction of the American demographic that are a potential source for interest in K-pop music.

Now, on the other hand, K-pop is vastly more popular in East and Southeast Asia also due to the similarities I pointed out above. Besides popularity, K-pop has been a part of popular Asian music scene for decades starting with the earliest K-pop pioneers that received attention outside South Korea.

Also consider that East Asia already contains China, Japan and South Korea who are the 3 largest consumer nations of K-pop. The overall population of East Asia is 1.6 billion people.

K-pop is also highly popular in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia with massive fanbases. There are around 600 million people in this region.

So we have a simple statistic comparison of 320 million Americans (of whom only a minority are potential fans) versus 2200 million Asians (of whom a significantly larger majority are potential fans) and from this we can see that in Asia, there is a vastly larger potential fanbase than America could ever hope to achieve.

**So it all boils down to the question of, why do K-pop idols and their agencies not simply focus only on Asia, but try desperately to enter the American market, doomed to fail unless the K-pop groups change their concepts, styles and music to fit the American standard, which then invalidates the reasons we love K-pop in the first place?**",69,15

She happened to be trending #2 on Naver so I looked up what was happening and apparently there's a rumor going around that she's leaving the entertainment industry. According to the article, several ""sources"" are quoted saying her last comeback with Honey Summer was the last of her activities and her contract has ended. Another quoted source says NS YoonJi's worries about her future have grown. 

However, the same article has quoted her agency as saying, ""NS YoonJi still has 2 years left on her contract, we cannot understand how these rumors started.""

- There are 13 Celebrity Judges and 88 Audience members who have votes.
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 13 Celebrity Judges and 88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

This week's judges:

- Kim Gura
- Kim Hyung Seok
- Yoo Young Seok
- Shin Bong Sun
- Kim Hyun Chul
- K.Will
- Ji Sang Ryul
- Lee Yoon Seok
- Kim Chang Ryul
- Kim Jung Min
- Baby V.O.X's Kan Mi Yeon
- B1A4 Baro
- FT Island Hongki

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of eight major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"" behind the chart performance. The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",5,46

1044,2015-11-18,2015,11,18,3,3t6n59,Who do you consider to be the most charismatic performers in K-Pop?,silvermyth,1447783222,"So, I've always been casually aware of K-Pop, but this year I got into it in a *major* way. This is largely due to me getting hooked on videos of 2NE1's live performances and being absolutely blown away by how much energy they gave on stage (CL tho!!). I've also gotten into BEG, BoA, f(x) and Mamamoo because of their performances.

To be honest, I don't give much of a damn of how flawlessly a performer executes their choreo or how seamlessly they sync with the group. That kind of stuff is impressive, of course, but its not what draws me in. I absolutely love artists who get on stage and *lose their goddamn minds* and exude that palpable energy.

So, I'm asking you all to help me find more charismatic performers so I can lose myself in more amazing live videos. Who are your personal favorite performers in K-Pop?

Edit: yaaaay, you guys are awesome! I especially appreciate the mention of male idols/groups, because I'm seriously slacking on getting into the guy groups. now I have somewhere to start!",96,47

Hi everyone, mod from /r/koreanrock here! Two weeks ago, we finally kickstarted the sub into action and have grown a small community since then. We have a pretty decent variety of artists and sub-genres posted so far, so come in and browse around a bit.

Unfamiliar with k-rock? That's no problem, I've got you covered. Here's a brief selection of notable k-rock artists that may have escaped your attention:

* [Jaurim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfIypSkq2J8) (alternative rock) - arguably one of the most successful bands in South Korea
* [Galaxy Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_5e1oIcIaQ) (garage punk) - known for their fun, loud, and energetic sound
* [Sinawe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quVkIViG6_Q) (heavy metal) - one of the grandfathers of Korean rock (guess where Seo Taiji started his career?)
* [Lowdown 30 **(NSFW video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4JRSDWpS7I) (blues rock) - legendary blues rock band
* [No Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CQB1scYuw) (punk) - one of the first Korean punk bands
* [The Geeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOIf5suRkHU) (hardcore punk) - surprisingly, South Korea has a fantastically active hardcore punk scene!
* [Guckkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9eh1B_yNPs) - the *everything* band

Of course there's much more, but I'll reserve the surprise for your visit to /r/koreanrock.",35,149

But the camera work is so nauseating and manic that's it's become frustrating to watch a good amount of the live performances.

This is one reason why the dance practices are often my favorite because they typically have a fixed perspective and even a fixed camera sometimes.

Why is the live camera work so terrible?

Edit: [Here is a recent example in TWICE's Inkigayo performance of Ooh Ahh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KujgPxMW_08) It's not the worst I've seen, but it's pretty damn all over the place.

So I thought it'd be nice to dedicate a bit of time to old classic moments. This can be an mv, a cut from a variety show starring your favourite group, a live performance, anything related to kpop really. But since it's 'old but gold' I'd say 3 to 4 years should be the minimum limit to how old it is. 

One of my favourite old but golds has to be this bit of well known [savagery from SNSD's Hyoyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq_W4Z8a4ug)

Say you have to convince a die-hard Kpop anti or something like that.

What songs do you choose? These ~~three~~ six songs can of any music genre in Korean music (Kpop, k-hiphop, k-rap, k-indie, etc).

It's a great way to get to listen to new music maybe all of us haven't heard before.

I would choose BigBang's Monster, Wonder Girl's I Feel You, Neon Bunny's Oh My Prince, Nell's The Great Escape, Tablo ft. Jinsil's Bad, and IU ft. Seo Taiji's Sogyeokdong.

Not sure I can even choose a favorite yet, so far enjoying everything.",11,43

On a more serious note, more memorable moments were Yezi's crazy dog performance and diss battle against Trudy, Gilme's sick diss on Fakedy, and of course who could forget Yubin &amp; Jiyoon's epik collab.

But the single moment that topped it all was Yubin's rap performance, the one with the ""twerk twerk"" lyrics. They were dope as hell and a close second were KittyB's spits in the same challenge stage.

What were you're favorite UPR2 moments?",13,0

They brought a new style of music in the Korean scene which at the time included only of a)ballads and b)trot and *it had just started to diversify*. This lack of diversity in the genres of music in Korea due to high censorship that existed there. Seo Taiji and the Boys were revolutionary whether in lyrical content, the new genres they brought to the music scene, and they new demographic they captured: they made music for the youth. They were influenced by contemporary American music and their debut song proved popular with the audiences, even though not so much with judges. They disbanded in 1996, but after Seo Taiji himself continued a solo career, while the other two established record labels. Lee Juno kinda faded into obscurity over time. while Yang Hyun-suk founded YG Entertainment.

Shortly after YG, a number of other record labels were founded, including SM Entertainment, DSP Entertainment and JYP Entertainment. It is SM Entertainment which creates the idol system we are familiar with today. Lee Soo-Man, the founder, wanted to capitalize on the Seo Taiji formula which made them so popular in Korea, because whenever someone is successful, this is what happens, copycats follow trying to to the same thing. And it's not a bad thing at all, this is how things improve.

Lee Soo-Man worked in Korean broadcasting networks where he established connections, traveled to the US where he became familiar with the American music market, and used these knowledge to create his first product, [Hyun Jinyoung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyun_Jin-young). He is credited with bringing Hip-Hop to Korea (yes, you read that right, SM brought Hip-Hop to Korea). However, SM invested more in him than he could afford and the final product wasn't well received, so he decided to change the way of operation. It seems like he was influenced by the Japanese idol system. The idol system in Japan, was inspired by a French movie *[Cherchez l'idole (1964)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056927/)*, even now when you search clips of that movie on YouTube, you find them with [Japanese subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzfe-5Ihsc), just to show how influential it was. I'm gonna tackle just a little more the [Japanese Idol history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol#Culture), because history is repeating itself with K-pop:

&gt; In the 1970s, [Japanese] idols had an aura of mystique that left much of their lifestyles secret. Their public and ""private"" lives were carefully orchestratedthey always appeared perfect in all situations and seemed to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that most Japanese could only dream about. In reality, however, they were placed under continuous surveillance by their promoters and were unable to enjoy the private lives invented for them. Their pay is considered to have been surprisingly low. They were often overworked and even if their songs sold well most of the money went to the musicians and writers. 

Yep, idol manufacturing is result of Lee Soo-Man, particularly his desire not to fail again. The difference between idol group and simply group is the extreme training they receive prior to debuting, and the younger target audience. And looks were a must, this is what the people wanted according to a poll conducted by Lee Soo-Man himself. With this new knowledge, SM Entertainment released [H.O.T](https://i.imgur.com/8MPumyc.jpg) in 1995 who were a huge success musically and financially, and like it happens with success, copycats follow.

After H.O.T, a number of other idol groups followed like [Sechs Kies](https://i.imgur.com/egpOh2p.jpg), [S.E.S.](https://i.imgur.com/NmdV6aV.jpg) (the first successful girl group), [Fin.K.L](https://i.imgur.com/5Y6dAAN.jpg) (best known today for member *Lee Hyori*), [Baby V.O.X](https://i.imgur.com/PYmUjcK.jpg), [Shinhwa](https://i.imgur.com/IWvgWaK.jpg) (the longest lasting boy group, active even today) and [g.o.d](https://i.imgur.com/228kDdQ.png) (technically still active, though rarely performing) etc. They started many trend we see today among idol naming conventions: H.O.T stands for *High-five of Teeangers*, Fin.K.L stands for *Fin Killing Liberty*, Baby V.O.X stands for *Baby Voices of Xpression*, g.o.d for *Groove Over Dose*. These groups make up the first generation of idols and were popular from mid-Nineties to mid-Noughties, the first wave of K-pop craze sweeping Korea. [Reply 1997](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4137/Answer_Me_1997/) is set during this time and explores this culture. If you have not seen it and want to, go on, it's very enjoyable. If you don't want to, it's OK.

In 1997, Asia was hit by [a financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis), prompting Korean industries to look for overseas markets for their products, which included entertainment. This marks the beginning of the Hallyu Wave (redundant name because Hallyu means *Korean* wave). For K-pop, this is the time SM Entertainment pushed for the Japanese music market, the 2nd largest in the world, through [BoA](https://i.imgur.com/N8BUhcq.jpg). BoA's training was unheard of before in the K-pop system. She was manufactured with the intention of making to Japan or else. She dropped out of school to be devoted to SM, she studied Japanese to debut in Japan, and she debuted when she was 13. She was a huge success domestically and internationally but, I can't help but feel what would have happened if she wasn't. She had thrown away her life for SM, could she recover after that? It was a dangerous gamble, you either won all or lose all. She opened the doors for other K-pop acts internationally. I should also mention, contemporary of BoA was JYP's Rain who expanded Hallyu in China, the way BoA did in Japan. I wrote more for BoA because what she did was insane and new K-pop fans don't even know. She deserves respect for this. 

It's during this time K-Pop starts to change its appearance. You see all those hairstyles during the First Wave? Yeah, they kinda continue early in the second wave as well, but thankfully this is the end of it. K-pop start deciding about their own appearance, their own beauty trends. That's good.

Musically, the Golden Age of K-Pop begins with one song: [Wonder Girls' Tell Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlHv3BbBv6A), a group manufactured by JYP Entertainment. I haven't talked about his founder, like I talked for the founders of YG and SM. He was a musician, he still produces music, his latest song ""Who's Your Mama"" was a success, and [he wore plastic pants](https://i.imgur.com/BYqUNKg.jpg). I have no ill feelings towards him, it is my obligation to post that picture. But really, his contributions to K-pop need to be evaluated too. You see, when SM and YG tried to emulate contemporary Western music, JYP went retro, and thus ""Tell Me"" was born. It was a huge success. I keep repeating every-time something popular, copycats ensue. Second generation idols were pretty much this, emulating the formula of ""Tell Me""and they became popular because of it. The ""Tell Me"" formula was a dance-pop tune with a word/string of words is repeat over-and-over during the chorus so it could get in your head and not leave. 

Don't believe me? Listen to a good representative of K-Pop before ""Tell Me"", [BoA's megahit ""Girls on Top""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJxaWZk8Vs8). Now let's list some of hits of the new generation: [SNSD's ""Gee""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ), [2NE1's ""I am the Best""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o), [KARA's ""Mister""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EQm6WPMHs), [T-ARA's ""Roly-Poly""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowfLIRpQaU), [Super Junior's ""Sorry Sorry""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw), [Wonder Girls' (again) ""Nobody""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBn1e9pr2Q) etc. Really, I can go on. It wasn't a thing they did it once, some groups reused the formula. SNSD's didn't use it only during ""Gee"", it also used it with ""Oh!"", ""Run, Devil, Run"", ""Mr Taxi"" etc. or KARA used it with ""Jumping"", ""STEP"" etc. That formula was the trend. And it was not a bad thing at all, it was this trend that popularized K-Pop to the point it [surpassed J-Pop in international popularity](https://i.imgur.com/niBqFDi.png) and J-Pop never recovered again. Another proof that this trend was not a bad thing at all is [T-ARA's Absolute First Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=361hFoDibio), the first truly good album in K-Pop, every song uses that formula. It finally peaked with PSY's ""Gangnam Style"" in 2012, the most watched video of Youtube which I'm not even linking, because it's overplayed. All this thanks to the trend started by JYP.

By 2013, companies started trying to gradually move away from that sound. It was becoming overbearing. K-Pop needed diversification. Diversification started in 2013 with SNSD's ""I Got A Boy."" The song was the first attempt of a Korean agency to not follow Western trends. Granted is still Western influenced music, in fact it is written by Swedish composers, and probably not the best example of trying to move away from the earworm formula but it's unheard of in the West. Love it or hate that song, it started a new era. At this time, K-Pop is in a transitional phase, they are trying many new genres, [f(x)'s amazing ""Pink Tape""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2LwR_D-sio) being a great example of that done right. 

What we are noticing now in 2015 is the coming of new blood and the gradual fading of old ones. Yes, many of them have released songs this year too, but their contracts are expiring, while Seventeen, Ikon, Twice and other nugus, haven't even had anything to sweep Korea like the hits 2nd gen had, yet they are filling the front page of this very sub and other forums. Rap has become more popular too, as proven with shows like Unpretty Rapstar. 

I tried to mention everything, but left a lot without saying trying to hit only the important points. So, what do you think it will happen next?

EDIT: Fixed some incorrect information

EDIT 2: Many of you have rightfully asked about Big Bang. I tried to give all at least mentioning but I ended up cutting a lot of my original text because it was going too long. Beside BB, I didn't mention SHINee either, and all those others I forgot, I'm sorry.",116,225

If you've frequented /r/kpop for a while you've probably noticed that weekends are pretty dead as far as new releases go. As a result, I thought it would be nice to showcase songs that usually don't get the spotlight today while we all wait for the mainstream releases to start back up again come Monday.

I went through a ton of releases from the past week and curated a playlist of what I thought were the best songs. It's not overly exhaustive, and my own tastes are going to have an influence, but I'm hoping that this post will introduce you to an artist you love that you never would have found otherwise. As a rule, I'm abstaining from songs that were posted on /r/kpop at all throughout the week, even if they only had two up votes in order to keep things as fresh as possible. For each song I've included the genre of the song based off of the genre listed on melon as well as my own opinion (for example, adding **Electronic** to a heavily electronic song when the genre for the album is **R&amp;B/Soul**); feel free to call me out if my genre listing is whack...I used the term ""Coffee Shop"" a lot for lack of a better word lol. 

All these songs are pretty laid-back, so grab some coffee, find a nice window to stare out of, and let's enjoy some music shall we?

Edit: Thank you for the overwhelming response everyone, I never imagined this would be so well received! I'll definitely attempt to do this on a weekly basis~ Also, I came across Jung Gilho's official MV for Don't Find Me on youtube while searching for other tracks off his album, so if you enjoyed that track be sure to check it out and show some love! I was the only view when I found it which is a shame because its a great song!

&gt; Highlight of the article:  *""Starship is currently planning to debut a girl group in 2016. But none of the members have been finalized.""* - *Source: [Starships trainee Son Juyeon, going for her dream to become an idol](http://starshipgirls.tumblr.com/post/133527615846/trans-starships-trainee-son-juyeon-going-for); Translation: sonjuyeons @ starshipgiris (Twitter)*

Starship had already mentioned that they had plans of debuting a new boy group and a girl group back in 2013.  Rumors began to float around since then.  In 2014, Starship uploaded audio/video clips of their new boy group under the ""NuBoyz"" name and ""New Artist"" tag:

* [[MIXTAPE] NUBOYZ() - PROBLEMS (feat.YELLA DIAMOND)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffogHBe6jVA)

* [[NEW ARTIST] (NUBOYZ) -  NEW @140801  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj69gn9dfJY)

^ As you know, 3 of the 4 members of this group later end up making their official debut in Monsta X.

Not much has been revealed about their new girl group on the other hand.  I've made a thread about Starship's current female trainees not too long ago by the way.  Here's a link to the thread if you are interested: [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3g7x0l/discussion_starships_female_trainees_and_other/)

^ EXY was not included in the thread, because I did not know about her at the time.  ~~Kim Nayoon's trainee status with Starship is still up in the air.  All we know is that she signed with Starship as a trainee shortly after KPOPSTAR season 1.  Fans believe she left Korea some time later to continue her studies back home in the US, but others claim she is still training under Starship.  No real concrete sources, so I don't know what to believe.~~

&gt; **EDIT^1 :** Thanks to /u/Limebabies I was able to find [Kim Nayoon's instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nayoonieee/).  It should be her real instagram account since [Park Jimin](https://www.instagram.com/jiminxjamie/) follows her.  From what I can see, she is definitely back in the US now, ~~so it's safe to assume that she is no longer affiliated with Starship Entertainment.~~    

&gt; **EDIT^2 :** More info from our fellow redditors; ""I can confirm that Nayoon is in the US pursuing her studies currently, however she mentioned to me that perhaps after she's finished, she may go back to her music career. Whether that means she's still with Starship is unknown at this point as she didn't mention that."" - /u/giga90; [permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3un6o8/info_starship_is_currently_planning_to_debut_a/cxg9325)

&gt; ^ ***Note: Take these updates with a grain of salt.  These are mere speculations as we have yet to be given any form of official announcements or credible sources regarding her current relation with Starship.***

As of now, these are the potential members of Starship's new girl group: [x](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUGRRZpXAAAm20H.png:orig); cr: [@Starshipgirls](https://twitter.com/starshipgirIs)
