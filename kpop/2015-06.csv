For VIPs attending on June 01. Please note that you will not be receiving a light stick and pick up for these will be at a later date. This is because there was an issue with customs regarding the light sticks. Because of this, light sticks were given out to VIP M&amp;G only due to low supply. 

Also the light sticks are long pieces of hollowed Styrofoam with 3 blue led lights. Nothing is printed on them. So they are customizable. ",27,4

I'm curious to see what other fans think. How do you define Kpop? I really want to move past the ""music made by Korean people"" definition, because I think there are some defining characteristics.

I wrote a piece trying to define the genre, you can find it [here](http://www.criticalkpop.com/2015/06/an-honest-attempt-to-define-genre-of-kpop.html), but even if you don't read, I'm interested in your opinion!",31,0

Kpop is filled with some of the most impressive pop choreo, so tell me what you consider to be the best of the best! 

**If you add a link in with your comment, try and keep it limited to the bare bones choreography if possible. If there isn't one for that group/song then try and find a live performance that stays away from close ups too much. While MVs are great, it is easy to edit to make things appear differently, and I really would like to see choreo that can stand on its own!**

EDIT: THANK YOU to everyone that has commented (and to those who still have stuff to share)! I have been going through everything linked, so even if I haven't replied to you specifically, just know I still appreciate it! There is so much good stuff here!

Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference Announces Postponement


DALLAS, TEXAS, JUNE 15, 2015 - The Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference, which was scheduled for July 3, 2015, through July 4, 2015, at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, Texas, has been postponed until July 2016 due to the current MERS outbreak in South Korea. 

Although the organizers of the Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference gave the matter much consideration, postponing the event is in the best interest of all involved parties including South Korean performers and festival-goers. With the current MERS outbreak, there is a potential for a health scare, and the Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference organizers, performers, and artists are erring on the side of caution. The artists and performers agreed that the postponement was a wise decision, and they look forward to coming to participate in the 2016 Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference. 

Ticket holders can receive a refund by contacting support@hallyufest.com or by contacting their ticketing agency. Full refunds will be given with exception to service fees. Should ticket holders wish to retain their current tickets, they will have top priority for the next scheduled event.

The 2016 Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference will be officially announced at a later date. The event will feature Asian performances, art, food, entertainment, and more. The Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference gives a glimpse at true Asian culture, with events and demonstrations featuring pop culture, music, music videos, and more. The Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference aims to raise awareness for Asian culture while offering a fun experience for people of all backgrounds. Customers will be able to place their tickets on lay away at a future date to lock in their spot before slots fill up. Scholarship recipients will also be announced at the event. Those that have submitted the 2015 scholarship application before the deadline, will not have to resubmit. More information can be found at http://hallyufest.com/.

About the Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference

The Hallyu Festival &amp; Conference strives to bring people closer to Asian culture, music, and art.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",10,20

I recently listened to 'Jun Hyo Seong - Into You' and noticed it sounded kind of similar to an old British group's song called 'S Club 7 - S Club Party' which was quite popular back then.

Personally I don't mind this at all and actually heavily encourage sampling of songs in any genre (huge fan of Daft Punk) if they manage to creatively make their own track out of it. While I understand others might not like this concept, sampling or inspiration from other songs is out there in most music to some degree.

What I was wondering about is how you feel about this subject and more importantly for me if there are any good examples of blatant sampling use in k-pop. I reckon it will be mostly rap songs haha.

I'm completely new to K-pop. Ordinarily speaking it's not my type of music, but my girlfriend is really into it, and I may grow to like it too. I can't have an informed opinion without know something about the industry, the bands, and the general hustle-bustle of the scenes. So to make a bit more concrete:  

* What are some songs or bands that I should absolutely listen to? Any mainstays in genre that I have to know of, or bands that left a true impact on the genre?  
* What is the modus operandi of the industry? How do bands get their fame, and how do they lose it?  
* What are the most recent trends in the genre, is there anything that a band currently absolutely has to do in order to make it big?  

If there's anything else that's worth noting please do tell me, and thanks in advance!

Note: All of these groups are set to comeback during the summer at some point. Some of them have confirmed release dates, others do not. This is not some sort of joint concert.
 
**\#SNSD**

Mission: '8 member system' Let's prove we're still prospering!

Admiration Tip: 9 year top girl group's confidence and enjoyment.
 
This time, Girls' Generation's announced comeback album is their first with 8 members, after the departure of Jessica. Girls' Generation must prove that they can still be successful with 8 members. With this, Yoona, Tiffany, Taeyeon, Sooyoung, Yuri and the rest of the members as well as the fandom were affected by the breakup and both groups are ready to accept the challenges. Technically, SNSD has been active since September of last year, with TTS completing a successful round of promotions. On December, the 8 members held a concert at the Tokyo Dome. They are ready. The number 1 girl group 9 years running's confidence and composure, one everyone can enjoy together.
 
**\#Sistar**

Mission: Lets achieve a 100% success rate in the summer!

Admiration Tip: Summer success rate of 100% - Confidence level of 100 points, 'Watch and believe it'
 
Sistar's songs almost have a 100% success rate. 'Shady Girl' - 'So Cool' - 'Loving U' - 'Give it to Me' - 'Touch My Body' - 'I Swear' ... Their summer lineup success is almost a myth. With this comeback their mission of maintaining a 100% success rate is put to the test. With the 'Watch and believe it' label, Sistar's credibility is reinforced with a bright outlook toward the future. They comeback on the 22nd with a Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman, concept, creating heightened expectations.
 
**\#Girl's Day**

Mission: Lets keep our spot at the top!

Admiration Tip: Find their synergy through their brilliant individual activities
 
Girl's Day after their summer release of 'Darling' have each branched out into their own individual activities, building up to their return as a group. Hyeri chharmed with her aegyo in MBC Wednesday's 'Real Men' and with various CF's and drama roles. Recently, tvN 'Reply 1988' has casted her for acting and music, both of which are looking to be on the rise. Minah also proved her skills with a solo album released in the beginning of the year, Sojin through MBC 'Mask King' and her acting through TV Chosun 'The Greatest Marriage', SBS 'The Family is Coming'. Yura showed her charms through MBC 'We Got Married' and JTBC 'Off to School'. Each of them showed their own performances. With this comeback, the synergy created from their individual activites is greatly anticipated.
 
**\#Nine Muses**

Mission: Lets make a solid performance!

Admiration Tip: Model idols and summer have created a chemistry
 
Now is the time for Nine Muses to show positive results. In January 'Drama' was announced, and they added 2 new members, Sojin and Geumjo. Nine Muses's 'Drama' was nominated for first place in multiple music shows even after over a year of no promotions. Coming back after 5 months they are expected to rise even more. There is a lot of confidence. Model-idol and summer meet and give notice to the best ever summer album. The 8 member's slim figures and 'sexy season' meet the summer and one can begin to imagine the chemistry and expectations. Here the 'Nine Muses cast' in reality and entertainment programs shows off charms that will be the catalyst to you joining the fandom.
 
**\#A Pink**

Mission: Show them our charms!

Admiration Tip: An innocent girl group's unrivaled growth
 
Apink's innocence and purity as a girl group is at the top of the ladder and must be respected. A Pink climbed to the top of the girl group world and are here to stay. Lovelyz, G-Friend, Oh My Girl are emerging as the newest line of girl groups looking to follow in the path of A Pink. A Pink is the girl group ace of the innocence concept and must continue to show growth. Together the members' charms can all be seen. Last year, A Pink, through ""LUV' have added some maturity to their innocent image. With this album, the secret is not to differentiate the concept strategy, but fort A Pink to simply show their charms.
 
**\#AOA**

Mission: Prove we are the trend!

Admiration Tip: Cosplay - Catwoman links to remaining projects
 
AOA is here to show they are the trend. Jimin in 'Unpretty Rapstar', Choa in 'My Little Television', and Seolhyun in the movie 'Gangnam 1970' and drama 'Orange Marmalade' show the member's individual activities. But the trend's indicator was winning the first place trophy on music shows twice. They need a good product to support themselves, otherwise their popularity may decline. Real trendy AOA is 'Sporty Sexy' and unveiled their members as part of a lacrosse team. Summer has just turned hot.
 
**\#Mamamoo**

Mission: Their presence makes a show!

Admiration Tip: Dress like a man, a visual reversal. 
 
The best ever lineup festival has Mamamoo demonstrating how much presence they have. The comeback schedule is crowded, but their energy levels cannot be understated either. With their already recognized skills and reliability, their unique trailer has them seeking wins. Dressing in male attire isn't the only thing they have to do, their special makeup takes more than 3 hours to apply. Mamamoo's ability to transform into males brings to question just what visual reversals will they bring to the stage?",15,58

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",3,23

708,2015-6-14,2015,6,14,8,39r62t,Considering the upcoming launch of Apple Music... what are the best places to listen to kpop?,kdevin,1434237481,"So... just having gotten into kpop earlier this year, I kept a YouTube playlist with my songs, but now that I'm getting into more songs, YouTube is becoming a little more difficult to work with. It's great because pretty much every song is there in some way, but the thing I'm worried about is that videos can get taken down pretty easily. I would hate to make all these elaborate playlists just for half of the non-title songs to disappear every few weeks (and maybe not remember exactly which ones I had where). 

I haven't been able to find another site or service that has entirely the selection I want. I'm kind of against paying for a monthly streaming service (preferring to use a free version or pay on a song-by-song basis), but I would consider it if there was a place that had all the songs I wanted.

I've been using Spotify some, but there are large gaps in songs that are missing. iTunes seems to have the widest selection from what I've seen, and the upcoming launch of Apple Music is making me reconsider paying for a streaming service. However, even iTunes doesn't have some songs I want (like for example, maybe it's just me, but I can't find any pre-split TVXQ songs anywhere on the Internet?)...

So, how do other people get around the selection issues and where do you listen to your music? And will Apple's streaming service change anything for you?",34,19

The ""Baddest Female"" persona obviously won't fly well in the US market as she has no street cred as an underground rapper and I agree the Pop meets Rap style she's going with - the likes of Niki Minaj and Iggy Azalea - is her best persona option. But, I have this bad feeling she won't do well because the US public won't want a another one, an Asian Iggy, especially after Iggy has received criticism from some fellow rappers and the public for being a cheap rapper imitation, a trained product of a record label. Let's be honest, the trainee system, is looked down on in the US public.

I think she has become a much bigger personality and performer on stage and I give her props (or to YG?) for featuring on these songs and performing in these music festivals. It could be a good intro, to showcase her star potential.

Still, I hope she retains her KPop flare to give her a different edge; less Dr. Pepper and more Dirty Vibe and Revolution.

Have you experienced this with a KPop group and why?",38,3

Show format:

- There are 11 Celebrity Judges and 88 Audience members who have votes.
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 11 celebrity judges and 88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

This week's judges:

- Kim Sung Joo
- Kim Gura
- Kim Hyung Seok
- Ji Sang Ryul
- Shin Bong Sun
- Lee Yoon Seok
- Yoon Il Sang
- Beast Dongwoon
- B1A4 Sandeul
- Hwang In Young
- Verbal Jint
- Dal Shabet Subin


Round 1 format: The two singers sing a duet, and the loser performs the song that they would have sang in the second round, while revealing themselves.

755,2015-6-15,2015,6,15,5,39u3q5,So I have just discovered kpop,wegottagamer,1434312121,"Hi all, as the title states I have today discovered kpop. I have no idea how I have not heard of it sooner!

I came across it whilst watching a video from a youtuber called JellyBean

kpop dance ( where I first came across kpop ) - https://www.youtube.com/user/jellybeannose/videos

ASMR - https://www.youtube.com/user/jellybeanasmr/videos

I left a comment on one of her videos and mentioned how the style of dance reminds me of Anime and as I mentioned I go on Reddit she linked me to this subreddit.

As I am making this post I have been listening to music from Bigbang, 4Minute, Hyuna and other random artists.

I live in London and I listen to all genres of music such as Hip-hop, D&amp;B, R&amp;B, Trance, Techno, House, Dubstep, Chart and every other genre. I think it is clear to say if I like a song I will listen to it.

please feel free to link me to any channel that I might like, I like kpop which has more of a tempo to it, a bit clubby such as 

BangBangBang - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw

4Minute - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY

Good Boy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZRb1we80kM

I Need You - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMdTd9e-LEI

I also do not speak or understand a word of Korean so it si quite interesting, I have come across a couple of youtube videos which have English sub titles which is really nice.

I would like to know if there are any other people who are similar to me with regards to either being quite new to this music or being from another country and enjoying this music.

**Tl;Dr** I am new to kpop and I would like to know where to I start to get to know this genre of music more. How did you find out about kpop, where are you from? I am also going to post this over at /r/kpopslumberparty 

**EDIT** Wow, I have received more attention on this post that what I could of ever expected. I have learnt so much from all of the links and information everyone has been giving me. The kpop community is a very friendly and helpful place. Thank you everyone very, very much!

I thought of this thread when I realized there are so many hidden dark closets and dynamics between idols and their group and labels, even though I've been listening to KPop since '09.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)

When in reality, idols do not have salaries at all. The relationship between an idol and their company is business, and they have a profit sharing contract between them. What this means is that:


1. If an idol group generates a profit then BOTH the company and the idol makes money.


2. If an idol group does not generate enough profit, then NEITHER the company or the idol makes any money. 


An example you can see for yourself, [TVXQ's old contract.](http://truetvxq.blogspot.kr/2011/01/complete-translation-of-contract.html)",9,0

Sorry if this kind of post isn't allowed! But I got way too excited yesterday in the store lol. It's mostly older albums and from what I remember, the list included things from:

* 2AM
* 2PM
* FT Island
* B1A4
* Shinwha
* CN Blue
* VIXX
* G-Dragon - One of a Kind
* EXO - First Box
* ...and more

I got B1A4 - Ignition Special Edition for 10400 (originally 20800) and Baba B1A4 1st Concert DVD for 15600 (originally 51800)! Kpop albums almost never go on sale so definitely go check it out if you can!",18,42

(Interview for Croatian kpop radio)",blockgoddess,1435003658,"**Question** (4:10): You are now judging SMTM4. What is it like to be there, surrounded by so many artists? I read that there are a lot of idol rappers in SMTM4, and some kpop fans are really excited about it but some are not so happy because SMTM is for unrecognized rappers to show themselves. What are your thoughts on that?

**Jay Park**: There are a lot of idol rappers, but theyre putting everything on the line and coming out because they feel like they deserve more recognition as artists, as rappers and as someone in hiphop. So its up to them and its not really for anyone to say that they cant come out, they shouldnt come out. Its their choice. But just because theyre idol rappers doesnt mean they get any special treatment or anything like that. They might even get a little bit more heat or we could have the thought that this guys an idol rapper, hes not gonna be good. [] If theyre good, they will go through and if theyre not, they will get eliminated. Show Me The Money is fun, but its also very decisive and cold.

So you go online and look up stuff, but its always the generic logo of the group (albeit fine but somewhat looks tacky) or the really ugly and cringey design that has group members name strewn all over it or has stuff like ""don't touch my oppa"" or just really ugly looking. Yea sure, theres a handful of actual good looking merchandise that you can wear without you regretting that you bought the shirt at all and that you wont feel embarrased wearing it in public. Well I want to change that. I want to make wearing kpop not tacky and cringey to wear out in the public. I have been getting influence on modern day streetwear, and of course, kpop, to create designs on shirts to have a look of an ordinary t-shirt that you would generally wear, but at the same time rocking your favourite group and idol without feeling tacky or embarrased. I have had a couple designs created but I am not ready for them to be sold onto shirts, so I am looking for opinions on my designs to see if people would actually want to wear these.

I know in the past there have been past arguements from other threads about copyright infringement and such and I am trying to make more designs without the use of group names and logos These are the only couple I have out of the many I am experimenting with. I hope everyone likes these and wish to change the way merch looks. Thanks for taking your time for reading this.        

Also please criticize the designs in any way, I'd appreciate it.

TLDR: I want to make kpop merchandise not ugly looking and post sites and places that you think sell good looking kpop merch.

Edit: Some of the more recent designs I have made

Following the confirmation that girl group Wonder Girls are officially making a comeback to the music scene, it is being reported that they will return not as a dance group, but as a band!

Various music industry insiders have noted that the members of the Wonder Girls have been carrying around their individual instruments to and from their practice sessions in order to make their transformation into a band.

It is said that **Yoobin is in charge of the drums, Hyelim on the guitar, Sunmi with the bass, and Yeeun on the keyboard.** It is also reported that the girls have been carrying out a band concept for their music video filming, which began on June 24.

On June 24, a representative of JYP Entertainment confirmed that former Wonder Girls member Sunmi will be re-joining the rest of the members for the groups upcoming comeback for the first time since withdrawing from the team in 2010. It is reported that the four members have continued to prepare for their return as a band for about a year.",0,0

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",2,11

They're always talking about their ""biases"" I'm not sure what that is but they're always talking about them. When I hang out at their house they play these songs and I can't even understand them, but they're all like ""Yeah, I did some searching and and the lyrics are so good. I'll show you the subbed version."" And then they don't really watch TV like that, they watch K-dramas or anime. They also play video games (I suck at them). I don't understand what they talk about and it's really confusing. They know all the names and they have blogs and go on this website and get news and stuff. They even get worried about them and stuff. Anyways, we were at one of my friends house and I asked if we could put some 1D on. They were all like ""Ew, are you serious?"" and then they put on a new vid (I think it was called Dope) and they started talking about it and stuff. And so I said ""what's so good about them?"" and then one of my friends (I'll call her E) went on about how they are amazing dancers,singers, and how they are all good looking. I just sighed and said ""they're fake."" and E looked at me with this face that said ""shut up"" but my friend (A) said ""Excuse you, this group is nowhere near fake."" and they all kept watching. I've been feeling away from them lately but they are getting close. I'm pretty sure E set up A and C (my other friend) on a date. (E is a lesbian and is dating the most popular girl in school. She likes k-pop 2 but she's not my friend :/) and I'm afraid they will stop hanging out with me! pls help, we used to be really close.

I'm also going to be on vacation for part of it, where I most likely will not be updating the list, but OneHallyu and the [2015 in SK Music Page on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_in_South_Korean_music#July) are usually accurate.  Italics are debuts of solos, duets, groups, and subunits.

Questions: 

* Is Spica coming back anytime soon?  A- B2Ment is probably merging with CJ E&amp;M this summer, so hopefully that means more funds for an upcoming release.  Juhyun/Sihyun's variety appearance probably means they'll be releasing a follow-up something.

* Where's Brown Eyed Girls?  A- After Miryo, who is supposed to release a song on June 30th.

* Exid and f(x) are releasing stuff in September.
