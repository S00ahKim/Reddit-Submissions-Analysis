3,2016-6-1,2016,6,1,9,4lyi23,Do you think kpop is growing ?,Pandellis,1464741052,"I've recently seen a video of the 100 most viewed kpop videos, and a lot of the newer MVs (2015-2016) have gotten a lot of views over this last month. While I was watching I got really happy thinking that kpop is growing more and more, but I want to know if that's actually true or not, so I made this thread^^
Is kpop popular where you live?
Is it getting more popular ?
Do you think it's growing ?

I live in Brazil so not a lot of people know about it, although I think it has grown a lot since Music Bank (2014) and other groups (mainly BTS) have come here.

Feel free to share your opinions here in the thread, as I'm really curious to know the state of kpop in different parts of the world ^_^",44,40

Like AOA's Good luck and OMG's Liar Liar. 
My first reaction when the song started was ""Woah!"" Then when the 1st , 2nd , 3rd chorus came up I was like 'ok.""


Those two songs are still good but I just felt that I was spoiled too soon at the start of the song


Discuss? There are also songs where the chorus comes at after the 1:30 - ish  mark Like that BTS song I forgot the name of xD",13,4

75,2016-6-1,2016,6,1,21,4m0x2g,SHINee's Jonghyun supports the King in the North (aka Jonghyun She Is fansign fan accounts),ladauphine,1464782935,"So this week I have had two fansigns. I'll hear back on number three in a few days. But I wanted to go ahead and put these two up (especially since I probably won't fan account three if I get in given the nature of what I'm going to talk to him about).

The first one was actually his first fansign for this promo cycle. It was up in Ilsan (near Kintex, I think they've held some Gayos there before) and about an hour's ride for me from work. 

Well I got out of work, sped my way to the station, and still missed the train I needed. Sigh had to wait 10 minutes for the next one. I ended up pulling into the station I needed to be in at 5:18 pm. My friend was waiting for me with a taxi held because we needed to be checking into the fansign at 5:30. Well I ran... omg I was dying by the end. So. Many. Stairs. This station was awful. But in the end we made it. We got in sat down and then we had about 30 minutes to just... be anxious.

My friend was number 13, I was 88. She went through. As is usual with these things all I could see was her back the entire time. She held hands with him for a sec then went and sat down. Slowly slowly all the other rows went until we got to my row with the last 20 girls. We stood there, waiting patiently and inching forward towards the stage, up the stairs, by the manager, until it was my turn.

When I walked over he was actually not looking at me, he was looking at his manager (who I assume was telling him to hurry the fuck up cause he had another fansign in like an hour a good ways away). At first it kind of made me sad. You get like 30 seconds absolute max so each moment in kind of precious in these situations.But in the long run I think it helped. He didn't dazzle me right from the beginning.

So I handed him my album and just launched into my story.

I said, all in Korean, ""I'm a kindergarten teacher in Apgujeong. My students really like to look at my phone and I have many pictures of you on there. They really love your pink hair. Because of it they call you ""Princess Boy"" and every day ask to see a new picture of you."" 

Jonghyun listened well, and giggled a lot at the ""princess boy"" part. But then suddenly the manager told me my time was up and to go. So I did. I just kind of went ""oh"" and took my album and started to walk off.

Then suddenly I hear Jonghyun say loudly ""Come back, you aren't finished yet"". I swear to god I like slowly turned as the entire auditorium of girls fell into a chorus of ""aaaawwwwwww"" and finished my story as he had asked. All I needed to say was the ""every day they ask to see a new picture of you"" and that was it. 

When I walked back to him I didn't walk fully back so the end of our conversation was fully visible to all the other girls. He listened so patiently and sweetly with a lovely smile on his face. 

As I walked off the stage I was already a mess. Just like crying and shaking. When I got to my seat all the girls around me were making such a thing over me, going ""aigoo, its okay"" and giving me tissues and patting my back. They were really lovely and helped me get my shit together.

As I took the train home, I ended up seeing a Korean girl fanaccount about my experience. She essentially said ""Jonghyun was the best with a foreign fan who was stuttering in Korean. She ran out of time and started to leave with a long face but he called her back and asked to finish her story and listened sweetly and attentively while she did"". This fanaccount also ended up on Instiz this morning lol, so now I've been indirectly featured on Instiz.

So there is fansign 1. A beautiful experience that like I still can't fully believe happened. Like Jonghyun called me back, he wouldn't let me leave without finishing my story as silly and small as it was.

So now, fansign 2. I just finished this one so it is really really fresh. Also its not as like touching or heartwarming as the last. But its really special because, while I've had a kinda conversation with him before, this was a real conversation. Small yes. But it was a back and forth and we responded to each other and he finished a sentence for me which is really fun to think about.

So tonight. I got off work and got to Coex by about 4:30 (I work about a 10 minute taxi ride away). Met up with my two friends who also got in and we found our seats. Had a friend in 15 and one in 59, I was 79 this time. We all had shit we wanted to say, (Friend in 15 asked him to come to America more often, he said he would try).

Tonight I actually had a gift for him. I don't normally get him gifts. I've only ever given him one before (a hand painted One Piece Luffy/BASE cell phone charm with a letter). Tonight I went out and bought him a copy of the first book in the Game of Thrones series (I put a couple cute dog stickers on it so If I ever see a pic of him with a book I'll know) as well as a Powerpuff Girls hand mirror and Powerpuff Girls pen and a Bubbles cell phone cleaner (the bookshop I got this stuff from had so much Powerpuff girls stuff). I decorated the bag cutely with dog stickers and wrote a note in the book. I also took the time to memorize the house mottos in Korean for the Starks and the Targaryens... just in case.

So finally it is my turn. Im a little self conscious cause I was wearing a skirt tonight but as soon as I got up there it just melted away.

 I gave him my album and as he was signing I said ""You like Game of Thrones right?"" He smiled and nodded not really looking up from signing. Then I asked, ""Which character is your favorite?"" He looked up and looked over my shoulder, pursed his lips a bit and thought for a moment. Then he said ""Stark"". 

I fucking knew he would be a Stark fan, I KNEW IT. So I said ""  "" Which is the translation for ""Winter is coming""

He kinda cocked his head and me and made a questioning noise, so I said it again. And I shit you not, in probably the most perfect English I have ever heard come out of Kim Jonghyun's mouth he said ""Aaahh Winter is Coming"" and laughed.

I was more than a little shocked. He has literally never spoken English to me before. All of my other friends, he will say ""hello"" or ""where are you from"" but its never happened to me. I'm happy with this too. But yeah the only thing he has ever said to me in my native language is ""Winter is Coming"".

Anyhow. So he goes back to my album for a second and I say ""I really like Daenerys Targaryen. Same..."" Here I stuttered a little bit cause the word for same is kind of difficult to say. 

He just looked up at me smiled really bright and said ""Same hair!!!"" while gesturing towards me. And I just smiled and ""nee'd"" at him again. Then I held my hand out and he took it and we did the finger lock thing and then I waved and left. 

I am so immensely pleased with tonights interaction. It has given me so much confidence and just contentment. It was such a normal conversation. It wasn't rushed or anything. I made him smile and laugh and made him think about something he enjoys. It was just really really nice.

*though honestly my fave GoT character is Sansa Stark. I just said Dany cause I wanted to draw attention to my hair, and because that character is why I originally started dying it this shade of blonde*

tl;dr: Kim Jonghyun is fucking amazing and wants a pet Direwolf.",86,184

Also in Bigbang's Loser, I like the symbolism of the 'stop' or 'wrong way' signs throughout the MV. GD walks past one, one is in the background of Taeyang's part and when Daesung is being dragged away there's one, and it ties in to the theme of them being lost in life/losing direction etc, which I thought was neat.

Any instances like this for you?",72,68

I had a fosse debout ticket which meant that I was in the standing area. There was a convention as well as the concert and I queued from 6am to get in because I had a feeling that one of the groups would do something (and I was right, BTS did a surprise Q&amp;A). I then went back outside and queued for the concert itself. 

All the groups did a special stage at the beginning (the unofficial Korean national anthem?) and Block B came on first and they were really good. They opened with Toy but also played Her, Walkin in the Rain, Very Good and Nalina. I don't actually know much about Produce IOI who were next but I read an article saying Somi couldn't perform literally 5 minutes before they came on. The other girls apologised for her absence. They were decent, although I don't really know any of their music. f(x) were absolutely amazing. They opened with 4 Walls and then they did Rum Pum Pum, and then Amber did Shake That Brass with one of the IOI girls and Luna did Free Somebody. They finished with Hot Summer. BTS were next and they opened with Fire, then they did Dope, Intro: What Am I To You, I Need U and Save Me. I don't know a lot about FT Island but they were okay, and by the time that Shinee came on I was so exhausted, but I remember them playing Sherlock, Lucifer, Why So Serious and View. There was a special stage where Taemin covered Richard Sanders and another stage with Luna and Taeil singing It Was Love. All in all, 10/10 would recommend, even if I did queue in the rain all afternoon and I had to travel to France in the first place. 

Edit: I just remembered BTS did Boyz With Fun too",42,66

Seems like Youngjae took the kill them with kindness approach (ofc this sunshine would).

Anyways, it is always sad to have to see an idol post about sasaengs.",21,132

329,2016-6-4,2016,6,4,5,4mezaw,Create a kpop group,fujipomme,1464987034,"If you were given the chance to create a kpop group of your choice using members of different groups what would you create?  

You can choose to create a boy, girl or co-ed group of your choice and you can also include soloists but obviously they must fit into an idol group.  There is no limit on the amount of members you can have for one group just try to fulfill the positions of visual, main/lead vocalist, main/lead dancer, main/lead rapper and leader.  A member can hold multiple positions and a position can be taken out if not needed for the group just please make sure to specify the reasoning.  Additionally you must state the type of concept and direction the group will have, for example a group with zico, g-dragon and mino will have a hip hop concept and will focus solely on rap.  

So this is just something fun for everyone to partake in because I like seeing posts on pann and such of fans splicing certain members of different groups to create a new one. I find it very interesting and I wanted to find out what people on this sub would want to create.  

Here are some of the rules and a quick summary what I wrote above (for the lazy):

* **Try** to not include more than 2 members of the same group (I just don't want anyone listing a whole group but swapping one member out) 

* No limit on the amount of members (just make sure it is realistic)

* **Try** to include a visual, main/lead vocalist, main/lead rapper, main/lead dancer and leader

* Members can hold multiple positions (ex. main vocalist and visual or main dancer and lead vocalist)

* Include a concept and identify what kind of group they will be 

NOTE: Any rule with **Try** in it can be negated as long as the reasoning why is specified, for example you do not need to include a rapper if you choose to create a group that is more centered on vocals.  Also if you are going to take out a position make sure that the group must be able to function musically as they will be releasing music, so don't try to make a group of 20 visuals with no members that can sing.

If you don't know who Big Brain are, well you should be ashamed of yourself.

Big Brain is a 4-man ballad group that debut in  late last year, and are currently performing on music shows with their latest song [Love, Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnmFakDKyA).  In my opinion, they are severely underrated and I think the /r/kpop sub could help them get more attention.

For more information, view [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/big_brain/comments/4mh0fl/big_brain_profile/) on the sub so you can become a true BRAINiac

I am a 24 year old girl that would REALLY love to go to KCON in LA and make a fun trip of it, but I have no one to go with. I'm actually a somewhat casual fan, but I love kpop and have never seen it live (I've actually never been to a live concert come to think of it). If you want to go but have no one to go with, send me a message! I'd have to get some verification and make sure we would get along okay, but it would make my year if I could go with someone who is as excited as I am. 


Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this type of discussion. I figured a bunch of people that are subscribed here will be going and I'd love to make new friends and have an amazing time. But if there's another subreddit that would be better suited, let me know. :)


edit: Hey if anyone is still interested, I've made a small fb group for anyone that wants to have a good time with like-minded crazy kpop fans in LA! Send me a message and I can get you added!",37,42

453,2016-6-5,2016,6,5,14,4mm3sz,DEAN NYC CONCERT,messymessy1,1465104398,"Okay so today Dean had his concert in NYC and it was a shit show. Let me tell you, I am completely boycotting SivaGroup Ent. I refuse to give them any more of my money after today and hope no more korean artists will either. Reasons why Sivagroup needs to refund people there money back. 

1. They changed the venue last minute. People had been waiting in line for Dean since like 9 am. It was crazy, especially since it was POURING today in NYC. So they had trouble with sound check and decided to change the venue but not let those who were NOT already at the venue know. They updated their twitter 30 minutes before the show was supposed to start annoucing people to check their Facebook page regarding an important announcement. Like wtf. I had arrived there at 7 since I was going alone and has GA so was just going to chill in the back. I found out whenever I arrived and was told to walk from 47th to 28th st to the new location. No apology. No explanation as to why the company could not email ticket holders. And those who waited lost their spot by the time they reached the new venue.

2. They changed the shows time.  Okay, so I take the train to 28th because it's pouring and I'm beyond annoyed. It's a long ass line, which is what I had been hoping to avoid. I then find out the show now starts at 9 pm. I'm even more livid. Its pouring cat's and dogs but im lucky im under an awning. I felt horrible for others. No one barely had umbrellas and were thoroughly soaked. 

3. They cut the show short. 
On top of starting late, the show was being cut short. We didn't enter the venue until 935 pm and the show fucking ended at 1018pm!!! Thats less than an hour since we had these lame opening acts. So people paid so much money for like 30 minutes of DEAN. 

4. The show was sold out. 
If you guys didn't know DEAN had GA for like $60, VIP for like $120, a fucking like ladies table packages for $400 and another table package for like $600 or something wild like that. And the venue was horrible! There were NO tables for these ppl to see DEAN in any type of special treatment. I don't even think they got the bottles of alcohol they were promised either. And we all were kicked out promptly after the last song. 

It was the biggest shit show. I really hope the ppl who got packages get refunded. Some people even left before the show started because they would be missing their bus home. It was unbelievable. I'm contacting the better business bureau and i hope others who attended will to because it was definitely not okay.

TLDR: DEAN is an angel who can do no wrong. His performance was solid. The problem was SIVA. People need to be refunded for a 30 minute show, last minute venue change, extra 2 hour wait in the pouring rain. I hope every time Siva annouces a concert with one of our favs, we as a group reach out to the company and tell them to NOT work with Siva and find someone else to handle their show in America. For the artist sake and fans. 

Edit: typos. I'm on mobile srry.

Edit 2: In case the comment doesnt make its way up, SIVA posted an apology on Facebook, yet I still hear nothing about refunding those who had paid for those packages. I still don't forgive siva and don't think they should have been put in the position where a venue change should have even happened y'know? They should've ensure sound check of the venue ahead of time, especially when they used a pretty unknown venue to begin with. Yes, I get a lot of work goes behind a job like this but I'm sorry, it's inexcusable. The whole point of bringing an artist overseas and ensuring their best international performance is to vet an amazing location for their performance, not cut corners. If I had Facebook, I'd definitely let them know exactly that. This was a half assed show and their attempt of apologizing, using the ""at least dean performed his an entire set!!!"" is definitely not okay since they ruined his beautiful voice with a subpar sound system that could not handle his vocals

Edit 3: Siva has reached out to me to be personally contacted by a higher up in the company. I declined, I stick by not supporting their events any longer and still stand by contacting oversea labels in retracting their future business with Siva (when its annouced) in order to ensure their artists are comfortable and happy with their show. I know I'm being very extra (hence the down votes) but there's a reason im messymessy1. Hope yall take this as a lesson in blindly supporting companies like this to ensure we as fans get what we pay for.",70,147

So, recently LOEN signed with Spotify. This week, that led to the addition of several artists older albums. There are too many albums to list, so Im just going to list the artists. There are definitely ones that Ive missed, considering LOENs large distribution network. If theres anything (non-Big 3) you like that havent been on Spotify before, Id recommend looking it up again now. Im pretty sure LOEN distributes more than 50% of all kpop groups. So heres what youve been longing for:

For other updates, my kpop Christmas playlist now contains 100 songs and is over 6h long. Expect it in about six months! Also, Spotify should really hire me. (Or just let me spend a day at their office so I could fix all the misplaced/misnamed albums, artists, songs and groups...)

Well, it turns out Luna was tearing up coz she was just feeling [*overwhelmingly* grateful](http://imgur.com/yBzBgzo) for the opportunity to go solo...or at least this is what was translated lol. If you're interested to watch Luna's full interview, [here](http://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/15028/Yu%20Hui%20Yeol's%20Sketchbook%20(2016)) is the link to the subbed episode of Yu Hui Yeol's Sketchbook, Luna's part comes an hour into the show; she talks about her childhood and her relationship with the f(x) members.

For me, it was Mamamoo and BTS. I was literally like I'm never going to love another girl group other than 2ne1 bc they're my fave etc...then I watched 1 Weekly Idol video of Mamamoo and I immediately fell in love lol.

And for BTS, well I became trash after I watched their weird but funny youtube videos",36,8

Since then, I've been going through some of my favorite group's concert videos and fancams in sort of an obsession. Although YouTube has been great, I was hoping to ask you guys what your favorite concert videos are as well? Fancams are great and all, but let's try and stick to some nicer quality and sound controlled videos! For me, I love concert videos because they usually have a live band playing the arrangement, so it's nice to hear some new ""remixes"" as well!

Here's one from [Block B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ-z2f5-KCs) 
[Zico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m-NWDqGHkw) 

With Big Bang's comeback, BBB was probably my favorite release so... Gimme that [Bang  Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYWqaolAPNk)  

YG has had some of the best live concerts, and CL has always been an amazing performer so here's [MTBD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ6xU7SSEn4)  

Now, lemme bring in some of SHINee. Although this is in Japanese, it's rare to find a concert video from them but here's Sherlock! One of my more preferred promoted songs that they did [Sherlock](https://youtu.be/A4VAzSSnesU?t=11m27s)  

Here's GOT7 with their recent comeback album, it's not their promoted track but [""Rewind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFUz5proQHI) I know that it took them a while to settle into a sound with their promoted singles, but they've always released really consistent and solid albums as well. Other than one or two from their entire discography, I can basically listen to an entire mini album and not skip around. 

Let's bring in some Jay Park and [On It](https://youtu.be/B1dp-Ap4ruI?t=3m45s) I was actually at AOMG's Chicago show, so I wish I took my phone out and recorded it but I would rather enjoy the show then nurse my aching shoulder from holding my phone up. ",45,31

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

Chanyeol obviously with the fire in his hand.

Baekhyun with the light from his hands.

Chen with the lightning striking the lady caretaker in the head.

Sehun with wind which you couldnt actually see, but implied 
since she knocked over the caretaker to the ground whilst staring her down.

Suho made water for both him and Xiumin to drink.

Xiumin had his hands with the ice cubes as well as making the the glass from where Suho made his water.

Lay grew/""healed"" a flower out of thin air.

Kai is a bit of a stretch but i think his teleportation power is somehow connected to his dancing, I mean you never see him running just dancing in different places... so possible he just poofed into dance.

As for D.O. he is strength but he is sedated along with the others, you can see him trying to shrug it off with his strength.


I think this story ties with the story of their debut and overdose. I think somehow someone managed to capture them (maybe the premise of monster) and encaged them in the overdose maze. There the caretakers who i believe to be controlled by a bigger figure are drugging and testing the members for their powers, until they figured out to escape.


Note: They might have been in the overdose maze for a while, and the end scene where you see the maze has three very distinct lines in the middle is supposed to represent the past members. Perhaps the caretakers or who ever are in charge, experimented on Kris, Luhan and Tao first and they didn't make it, and the three lines was supposed to represent their memorials.


Extra Note: Maybe they got in the maze because some called the doctor and gave them an overdose (OK im gonna stop that one was too far...lol)


TLDR: The e)(o boys are back with their powers!!",2,0

880,2016-6-10,2016,6,10,1,4nbl3k,"EXO's ""Monster"" MV has reached 4.48 million views in 24 hours, the most for a K-Pop group music video",IceBlast24,1465489567,"EDIT: 20 minutes after the initial 24 hours from the video's upload, the views are now at 4,545,654 and it's safe to say now that it is the most for a K-Pop group music video and even if it's 20 minutes late because we need to take into account that YouTube does not refresh the view count in real-time to verify the views :)

EXO's previous record for most YouTube views in a day was with 'Call Me Baby' at [4.1 million views](https://twitter.com/exonationsg/status/583101608134770689) and now EXO's ['Monster' music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSH-FVVtTf0) has the 2nd most YouTube views within 24 hours for a K-Pop music video right behind PSY's 'Gentleman' with [38.4 million views](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/4/psy-secures-new-youtube-world-record-with-gentleman-48291) and the most YouTube views within 24 hours for a K-Pop group ~~but I need to note that the music video **could be the 2nd highest** for a K-pop group (*or tied?*) since I don't know what is the exact~~ and the view total for BIGBANG's 'Loser' in one day which is recorded at [4.4 million views](http://myvipwaves.tumblr.com/post/117859224678/bigbangs-loser-breaks-the-record-for-most-views) is now the 2nd most views in a day for a k-pop group

Other records for most YouTube views in a day are:

Girls' Generation's 'PARTY' - [4.3 million views](http://onehallyu.com/topic/194503-snsds-party-24-hours-achievement/)

Girls' Generation's 'I Got A Boy' - [3.5 million views](http://onehallyu.com/topic/194502-snsds-breaks-their-own-record-for-most-views-in-24-hours-for-a-k-pop-female-group-mv-on-youtube/)

BIGBANG's 'Bae Bae' - [3.4 million views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsfgthXmZbI)

Note: The **real-time view total could be higher** as YouTube doesn't refresh the views at an exact time interval (not totally sure about this though so please forgive me if I'm wrong) and I'm not sure if BTS' 'Fire' will be included in these records because the music video has 2 uploads which garnered 2.9m and 2.3m respectively in a day totalling at [5.2 million views](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/05/bts-fire-mv-surpasses-an-incredibly-high-number-of-views-in-about-a-day) and if it would be considered as one music video is what I'm not sure of.",54,180

Don't think of a group in particular while posting your concept. This is not about what you think would suit your bias group best.

I'll start off. 

Not so original but a videogame concept where every member could be a different character of a moba or rpg with different skills and personnalities according to the idol's personnality. Could be pretty cool if animated.

Although I have enjoyed listening to K-pop for some time, I cannot stop thinking about how it came to be. From Seo Taiji and Boys from 1992 to Twice, EXO and NCT. 

How the English language came to be here in Korea, and the connections of K-pop and American Pop. There ARE connections, no doubt. You can see it, and of course, hear it in a majority of K-pop nowadays. 

The J-Pop industry is also an inspiration to the K-pop industry. 

I'm just rambling about. What is your opinion on K-pop as a whole?",59,27

905,2016-6-10,2016,6,10,9,4ndrtp,New stylesheet,fiveSeveN_,1465517947,"I finally updated the stylesheet. The new CSS draws heavily from material design, and you'll see some animations for actions like upvoting, saving links, and clicking tabs along with the redesigned components. I recommend getting Google's [Roboto](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_8/material_ext_publish/0B0J8hsRkk91LRjU4U1NSeXdjd1U/RobotoTTF.zip) font, which is free to download. I also spent a good amount of time working on night mode support, so hopefully RES night mode users won't need to disable the subreddit style (sorry for leaving you guys out for the last two and a half years).

Some other features include *some* responsiveness for smaller screen sizes, the pinned topics menu to the left of the main content area, and a random, rotating header. The stylesheet will cycle through a total of 36 different images to display in the header. I hope you guys like the images I picked to start us off.

Since I wrote the base theme to be applicable to any subreddit, a lot of customized stuff for /r/kpop probably got lost or forgotten, like the old upvote arrows and stuff.

If you come across some bugs or have suggestions for a feature, please let me know. Tag me in a comment, or PM me to make sure I don't skip over it in ~~hate mail~~ mod mail. Include information on how to reproduce the bug (browser version, RES settings, extensions disabled etc.), if you're sending in a bug report. If you have a general CSS question, though, /r/csshelp will be a better resource for help. Designing around RES and reddit's base HTML can be kind of a pain sometimes, so there are probably some weird bugs here and there.",371,0

966,2016-6-10,2016,6,10,21,4ng3sv,Bug report thread,fiveSeveN_,1465562640,"As it turns out, seven mods testing for the last month does not cover all use cases, and some users have had problems with usability on their setups.

Report all technical issues here, and include information like browser version, OS, screen resolution, device, and relevant RES settings.

Bugs that have been addressed so far:

#####Mobile browsing

The pinned topics and sidebar have been rewritten to give less trouble to users browsing the desktop version of the page on mobile devices. Since hover states are triggered on mobile by a long press or normal press, the pinned topics on the left side should no longer redirect until the links themselves are clicked. Instead of a fixed position they are now absolutely positioned below the header. Similarly, the subreddits bar no longer requires user input for it to display. Users on netbooks and lower screen resolution laptops should have fewer problems accessing the dropdown menus.

Since the default mobile reddit site is not ideal for users, I want to make sure that mobile browsers on the desktop site are not experiencing issues with the stylesheet.

#####Spacing and readability

Screen space is valuable, and so the amount of whitespace has been toned down to a more comfortable level for reading. The header has also been reduced in size. RES default comment styles should still be in place, and non RES users should also see comment boxes for easier scanning.

#####High dpi screens

Many of the media queries for mobile devices were affecting page rendering on high dpi screens as well, but those should be fixed. The spritesheet will be regenerated with hidpi sources (following input from the aesthetic change thread), so bear with the blurry sprites at the moment.

##### RES

So far no major bugs have been reported about the various esoteric settings in RES. The server debug info forcing an inline positioning rule has been fixed, as well as a bug involving forced overflow and positioning on sponsored and promoted links.

Bugfixing the new backend of this code is infinitely easier than the old stylesheet, especially with regards to RES and things like night mode, which was not functional at all for the last 3+ years. I want to make sure that these bugs are ironed out especially since they are much better to deal with now. With reddit making more and more changes to their global CSS, it's even more important for me to be able to keep up with changes, rather than continuing to hack together fixes

---

This thread is a little late since I've been in discord and IRC trying to get gamebreaking bugs out of the way for the last several hours. The responses are generally much quicker there and it's easier to filter out the threats and insults compared to scrolling through the inbox. I think I've addressed the major bugs, but this thread will help me keep track of technical issues versus comments on aesthetics. In hindsight, it's very easy to say now that the testing phase was not enough for the rollout, especially for mobile and high dpi. So far I'm glad to have gotten a few comprehensive bug reports, but it's my fault for not pushing ourselves to be more thorough. So I'll take the L for that",34,39
967,2016-6-10,2016,6,10,21,4ng41c,Aesthetic changes thread,fiveSeveN_,1465562749,"Or, taking back the subreddit's soul

Many of the major changes that were made are under the hood--for easier maintenance and tons of bugfixes. The aesthetic changes to the stylesheet are holdovers drawn from a framework and easily fixed now, so the primary concern (aside from technical glitches) is around layout, particularly these areas:

The dropdown menus in the sidebar were moved to the wiki, which is something that we've been wanting to refresh for a while now. As far as accessibility goes, it's probably worth looking into choosing the most accessed links to put back into the sidebar rather than indiscriminately throwing them all into the sidebar.

The pinned topics contains the exact same content as the dropdown menus above the site table that were often overlooked. They were initially fixed to remain in the viewport as the user scrolled, but its positioning on mobile browsers was inconsistent. So now they are positioned absolutely, rather than fixed.

Like I wrote in the original changes thread, many of the quality of life and subreddit specific changes have not been ported over. This is not a permanent change, and the look and feel of the subreddit is changeable. This is what's on the roadmap:

#####Headers

The images picked are meant to be placeholders until we decide how we want to go with rotating them as the months go by. The only thing we avoided was choosing images of idols to start. This discussion was always intended to be open to the community

#####Color palette

The increased negative space in the comments and around link entries  drowned out the colored components. It's since been reduced, but overall, more elements are colored in comparison to the previous layout. Many complaints have been made about lack of color, and it's much easier to add color to a barebones layout than to clean up a messy layout, so this is essentially a blank canvas

##### Snoo, vote arrows, and rage faces etc

Many of these quality of life tweaks were removed because of redundant code or messy implementation. All I can say for now is that they are not gone for good, and that reimplementing them is tied in with making sure the stylesheet is free from usability bugs",132,88

I'll start I thought Heechul would be very cold and quiet when I first saw him, it completely changed when I watched him on variety shows. When I first saw Sunny of SNSD I knew she was the cute member but after watching more content she is actually very witty and her aegyo queen appearance is really just a persona.

For the past few years, I have started to feel that normal 18 year old to 24 year olds look like them, and I constantly feel the urge to keep up my appearances in a similar manner. I don't wanna hear socially-endorsed critiques about how plastic surgery is so rampant in Korea and how we should love our natural look or whatever, or how strict that standards of beauty are, that is just old news just like how blondes have more fun in Hollywood - but **how it has these cultivated images impacted you personally**, if it has at all?

We've decided to make a separate thread to keep all of the suggestions for the banner / header image in one place. If you have some images that you think would be a fantastic header for /r/kpop, please post it here! In a few days we hope to set up a banner with rotating images based on the suggestions given to us by our subscribers!

Our dimension preference is 1920x223. We're looking for images that are ~artsy~ and dynamic and expressive, not just a basic group photo of your faves. :P

If you've already posted suggestions on another thread, feel free to post it here so that we can make sure it doesn't get lost in the sea of comments elsewhere.

There have been a lot of threads on here regarding K-pop idols who have gotten significantly better throughout their careers, but what are some who have shown a significant drop-off in talent or skill throughout their careers?       
This can be in regards to singing ability (i.e. voices degrading due to overuse, etc.) or performance effort (I could name a few idols who are notorious for looking dead on stage), or however you interpret it.  
Please refrain from using one video of a bad performance to substantiate your claim (i.e. a typical NB reaction where people see one performance where someone was tired/faints and claim the idol is slipping and doesn't care about their fans, etc.)

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.
~~~~
The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

Notes:

* The JP version of ""Danger"" was not performed. The group performed the Korean version instead.
* The group debuted a Japanese version of ""4 Walls"", replacing the Korean version.
* The group swapped out ""All Night"" for the JP version of ""Hot Summer""

So not too different, but just wanted to give a heads up in case people were expecting the setlists to be exactly the same.

Also, the covers for both versions have been released, which the DVD cover being [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkmJPIsUYAAjnEt.jpg) and the Blu-ray cover being [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkmJPIsUkAEJkIv.jpg)",3,15

----  
  
*First Accusation*: (Rumour appeared on the 12th June):  
  
- [Rumor - Park Yoochun(JYJ) sued for sexual assault](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4nvc42/rumor_park_yoochunjyj_sued_for_sexual_assault/) Accusation from a bar girl that Yoochun sexually assaulted her on the night of June 3rd. Her boyfriend put in the claim on June 10th.  
  
- [Reported that the woman drops the assault claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4o0tfy/woman_drops_sexual_assault_charges_against_jyj/) / [Additional Soompi Article](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/14/breaking-charges-of-sexual-assault-reportedly-dropped-park-yoochuns-side-responds/)  
  
- [NB article regarding the claim dropping after 5 days](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/park-yoochuns-lawsuit-dropped-after-5.html) Relevant comment over the general k-netz viewpoint on the matter: [+7,774, -252] Disgusted just by the fact that Park Yoochun went to such a place and did such a thing. It's obviously not his first time either... Whether the woman demanded money or not, he himself is a public figure and a soldier on top of that... what a shame.  
  
- [Yoochun fans doxx the wrong woman, believeing her to be the accuser](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4o1f2q/yoochun_fans_doxxed_the_wrong_woman_thinking_it/?ref=search_posts)
  
- [C-JeS statement on the accusations](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4o6agb/cjes_statement_on_accusations_against_yoochun/) From 2 days ago.  
  
- [Dispatch provide some extra insight on the first case, have photos of him entering the facility, but photos are not tied to the incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4ohj1p/dispatch_reveals_the_detailed_truth_behind/d4cnijt)
  
- [Dispatch also claim that Park Yoochun's reps may have used mobsters to threaten the woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4odgk4/netizen_buzz_dispatch_reveals_park_yoochuns_reps/).  
- Dispatch have also revealed a timeline of events of the supposed threatening, [AJ covers it](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/06/17/more-details-from-dispatchs-report-on-alleged-gang-role-in-yoochuns-case/) with an English translation.  
  
--------  
  
*Second Accusation:*  
  
- [Reddit thread link](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4obxma/breaking_second_sexual_assault_allegation_filed/?ref=search_posts) Claims that 'A' was assaulted in December 2015 by the singer.
  
- [C-JeS Ent respond to the second accusation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4od0nd/cjes_entertainment_officially_comments_on/?ref=search_posts) ""If Yoochun is found guilty of committing the crimes, he will retire from the entertainment industry.""  
  
- [Second woman reported the case as soon as it happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4ogttj/nb_2nd_woman_in_assault_case_found_to_have/?ref=search_posts) Reported the case four hours after the claimed assault. Called at around 3:20am on helpline 112 on December 17th. (Info provided in the Soompi Link down further below.) 
  
- DC Gallery also no longer support Yoochun, continue to support Junsu and Jaejoong who are not involved in the matter. [Soompi Link Regarding the fansite.](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/16/jyj-fansite-declares-intention-stop-supporting-park-yoochun/)  
  
- [Soompi Link With Further Info](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/16/details-concerning-park-yoochuns-second-sexual-assault-allegations-emerge/) Gangnam Police Station revealed that they have formed a special *Park Yoochun taskforce* to manage the investigations. The taskforce is comprised of six individuals and they will begin by summoning A and Ms. Lee to get detailed accounts of what occurred. Following this, they will summon Park Yoochun and get his testimony as well.  
  
----  
  
*Third accusation:*  
  
- Accusation came to light within the last day. 
- [Woman accuses Yoochun of assaulting her on June 12th 2014, reported it on June 17th 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4oi3sz/third_sexual_assault_claim_filed_against_jyjs/)  
- [C-JeS Ent respond again](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/17/c-jes-entertainment-plan-file-blackmail-false-accusation-charges-park-yoochuns-sexual-assault-cases/) Paraprased from article: C-JeS plan to file on Monday (20th) of blackmail and false accusations for the first case. As soon as facts for the second case are finalised (and presumably, the latter accusations as well), they will respond further.  
- [Accused assault one day after Junsu's grandmothers funeral](https://dongbangdata.net/2014/06/11/trans-140610-jyj-kim-junsus-grandmother-passes-away-funeral-to-be-held-on-the-morning-of-the-11th/) Funeral on the 11th June 2014 for her, the accused assault occurred on the 12th June 2014  
  
----  
  
*Fourth Accusation:*  
  
- Similar to the third accusation, also came to light within the last day.  
- [Accusation also regarding events of December 2015, different victim to the second](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4oinsa/a_4th_victim_has_come_forward_alleging_to_have/?ref=search_posts)  
- The task force created in light of the second accusation has had 3 people added to the force, 9 individuals are working to get detailed accounts on each accusation.  
  
*Addition: Some Korean sites are reporting that the date for the 4th Accusation is the 14th/21st February. Not too sure why there's such a major difference in the reported dates, but it appears that it the general consensus is that the 4th occured in December.* 
  
------  
  
*Update:* **18th June**   
  
- The police have started to question individuals who may be able to produce testemonies about the event, i.e workers at the bars to make a timeline of events. Yoochun is to be brought into questioning soon. [Soompi Source with further info.](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/17/police-start-questioning-individuals-park-yoochun-alleged-sexual-assault/)  
  
- C-jeS are to countersue all 4 accusers for blackmail and false accusations. [Bonus AKP article](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/yoochuns-agency-to-continue-legal-retaliation-against-alleged-sexual-assault-victims) (also covered in the above Soompi Article.)  
  
- Upcoming film 'Lucid Dream' that stars Yoochun is set to premiere in late 2016, at the moment it will not be delayed due to the accusations. It was the last film Yoochun participated in before enlisting. A representative stated that: *""We have nothing to say regarding Park Yoochun. We're in a situation where we can't refer to anything until official reports from the police. 'Lucid Dream' is currently working in the last stages of production, regardless of Yoochun's case. It is set to premiere some time in the later half of 2016, but no date has been confirmed.""* [AKP Link](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/upcoming-film-lucid-dream-starring-yoochun-to-continue-with-production).  
  
- **Male DNA has been found on the underwear submitted from the woman who made the first accusation. Police will be checking this DNA with Yoochun's.** [Korean Source](http://www.etnews.com/20160618000102) or [Soompi Article](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/18/male-dna-discovered-underwear-submitted-first-individual-allegations-park-yoochun/)
 
- Bonus rumour: [Police investigating whether the accusers are doing it for monetary gain.](https://jyj3.net/2016/06/19/trans-160618-new-police-statement-that-reports-syndicate-gang-tried-to-extort-park-yoochun/) *""A police representative stated ""We cannot elaborate at this time as it is an active investigation, but the operators of the adult entertainment facility is closely related to gangs around that area. We are investigating whether these people are filing accusations against famous celebrities for monetary gain. All the accusers are women who work in the entertainment facility. They filed the first accusation and asked for a settlement, but Park Yoochun's agency refused. Then, the second, third and fourth accusations of sexual assault came in and all show the same pattern of saying they were assaulted in the bathroom. Therefore, we are investigating if this is a scheme plotted by someone, and we have formed a special task force for this investigation, as this kind of movement is not uncommon for the gangs and entertainment facilities around Gangnam.""* | [Original Korean Article](http://www.ikoreadaily.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=233345)  
  
- The source for the above appears to be dubious. [AJ Article](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/06/18/police-investigating-whether-rape-cases-against-yoochun-are-gang-related-extortion/)
  
- [Naver Article](http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0000883257&amp;lfrom=twitter) | Setback in the initial investigation as A (made the first accusation) cannot be contacted. Also, the police state that if the DNA found in A's underwear belongs to Yoochun, it will be difficult to check if it was consensual or sexual assault.  
  
- Police have said that C + D (Accusations 3 and 4) did not submit any evidence to go with their claim. [Twitter Link](https://twitter.com/paulisteu/status/744041756128382976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) | [Original Korean Link](http://m.shinailbo.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=512947)

*Update*: **19th June**  
  
- Drama PDs: [It is impossible for Park Yoochun to come back on small screen even if he is proven innocent](https://twitter.com/theseoulstory/status/744433548166307840) | [Original Korean Article](http://m.entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0000883387) | [Netizen Buzz](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/drama-pds-say-it-will-be-impossible-for.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) |  
  
- There are now [12 people working on the case.](https://twitter.com/paulisteu/status/744458137785098246?lang=en) If necessary, 2 further people will join the investigation team.  
  
- Adding here due to convenience: Chinese Saesangs claim that the victims do not exist. [Tweet here.] In addition to this, a tweet has surfaced that suggests Yoochun was recording on the evening of the 11th. Junsu's grandmother's funeral was earlier on the 11th. Victim claims they were attacked between 3-4am in the morning of the 12th. Yoochun had to catch a flight to China for 8:40am on the 13th. [Tweet from the 11th June 2014 that explains Yoochun's schedule.](https://twitter.com/fourc_pyc/status/476714374350917632)  
  
- Yoochun seems to have had a flight change in relation to above. Relevant tweets about flight time changes:

- Bonus: Found an article from 4years ago that suggests Dispatch and C-JeS Ent haven't really been on good terms, which could potentially (albeit a stretch) link into the Dispatch report that mobsters threatened Ms Lee. [Article here.](http://www.dbsknights.net/2012/03/news-120320-jyj-to-sue-dispatch-for.html?m=1)
  
------  
  
*Update:* **June 20th**  
  
- C-JeS filed a suit against Ms Lee (first accuser). She withdrew her case before 3+4's cases got reported. [Soompi Article](http://www.soompi.com/2016/06/19/park-yoochun-sues-first-accuser-false-accusation-blackmail/)  
  
- Rumour: Ms Lee asked for 1 billion Won in settlement money (around $836,000 USD, 590,000). Ms Lee's boyfriend and older cousin met C-JeS and proposed for 500 million Won. This is when C-JeS counter-sued for blackmail + false allegations. [Original KR Article](http://pop.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=201606201932326327061_1&amp;RURL=http%3A%2F%2Fentertain.naver.com%2Fread%3Foid%3D112%26aid%3D0002824504%26lfrom%3Dtwitter) (Herald Corp is reliable, I believe), [JYJ3 Translation of the article](https://jyj3.net/2016/06/20/news-160620-revealed-in-contents-of-countersuit-park-yuchuns-first-accuser-demanded-1-billion-krw-in-settlement-money/)  
  
- Police have completed the first round of testemonies. All say similar things (i.e hold the bathroom handle so they can't escape, push them down by shoulders.) [AKP Link](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/police-completes-first-round-of-testimonies-from-alleged-victims-of-yoochuns-rape-case)  
  
------  
  
*Update:* **June 21st**  
  
- As included previously in the thread, there had been an issue with Yoochun's location relating to Case C. However, there are reports that Yoochun was also in China again when Case D accusation was reported to have happened. Koreaboo have reported in this, but there's also various evidence resulting from Twitter. [AKP Link](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/where-was-yoochun-on-dates-of-alleged-sexual-assaults) It looks like Yoochun has a **solid alibi** for the 4th Assault. (China Fanmeeting). 3rd Assault is under debate, he was in China on the 13th, but news sites are arguing on when he actually caught the plane. (Which can link into the potential change of flights covered above.)  
  
------  
  
*Update:* **22nd June**  
  
- Both C-JeS and Ms Lee (First Accusation) have provided voice recordings as evidence of making their stand on the matter. [Koreaboo Link](http://www.koreaboo.com/breaking/breaking-news-report-reveals-phone-call-conversation-claiming-cjes-ent-offered-pay-settlement-first-alleged-victim/) | [Naver Link w/video](http://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=055&amp;aid=0000421772)  
  
- 4th Accusation date seems to be concluded as the 21st Feb. 14th Feb like previously reported means a solid alibi. New date does not. Not too sure why the media started by reporting the date as Dec 2015, before moving onto 14th/21st Feb. [AJ Article with more info](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/06/22/reports-that-yoochun-has-a-china-alibi-for-3rd-4th-alleged-rapes-appear-to-be-wrong/)

- Non compliance by Mr Hwang, who is involved in the first case. He, along with Ms Lee's boyfriend had been engaged in the settlement for money. Police aim to get arrest warrants if this continues.

------  
  
*Update:* **28th June**  
  
- Dispatch reports that a fifth woman claims Yoochun tried to assault her (again, in a bathroom, she worked as an escort). Has no urge to report the case. Also has text messages from the time of the assault to a friend detailing the accusation. [Dispatch Article](http://www.dispatch.co.kr/541313) / [Koreaboo Short Translation](http://www.koreaboo.com/news/dispatch-reveals-existence-5th-woman-nearly-raped-jyj-yoochun/) / [OH Full Translation](http://onehallyu.com/topic/352995-update-dispatch-exclusive-a-5th-woman-accuses-park-yoo-chun/)

- Two of the women give interviews regarding their claims. Which accuser they are is unknown, I personally doubt it's Ms Lee as she dropped the case, so we're looking at two of the women from cases 2, 3 or 4. Both women in these interviews suggest that Yoochun led them to a bathroom to speak to them in a quite place (loud music playing, difficult to hear) [NB article](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/women-assaulted-by-park-yoochun-give.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter)  
  
- First accuser states she is not after money, 2nd accuser wrote a diary entry stating that if she died, attack Yoochun. Ms Lee (1st)'s boyfriend stated that they dropped the case as they wanted to 'quietly conclude the matter'.

- PD Notebook apologise for stating in their show that C-JeS have nothing ore to say on the matter. This show featured two of the victims giving further information regarding their accusations. C-JeS in fact did release a statement, saying that *""""Hello, this is C-JeS Entertainment. This is our response to your request for our cooperation regarding 'PD Notebook' for June 28.
From the initial reports on the situation until now, our stance has not changed. Many media outlets requested interviews, but we cannot consent to any. Due to indiscriminate reports on unconfirmed situations still undergoing investigation, Yoochun's image has been ruined. In this situation, rumors are flying and the importance of the situation is lost. We want to continue with our course, and we'll do anything to regain Yoochun's honor and reputation.""* [AKP link](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/mbcs-pd-notebook-apologizes-for-not-airing-statement-by-yoochuns-agency)

The headers were hard to identify as ""KPop"" and the spacing between comments made a lot of this sub seem unreadable. I turned off the custom theme for the subreddit and left it as the Reddit default. I saw threads where picture requests for the headers were taken, threads where people asked for the mods to change the entire css back the way it was, and a ton of threads just complaining in general about it.

I turned the custom theme back on today on a whim, and oh my god the sub looks **so much better** than it did a week ago. I took some quick screenshots of some of my favorite themes here: http://imgur.com/a/yBehE. I'm hoping that this thread will alert some of the people who turned off their custom themes last week to turn them on again and give it another try. I didn't see any threads mentioning these fixes had been implemented so I hope this thread will serve as a PSA.

Thank you Mods for the hard work you put into this -- it was a rocky start but for as much shit as you all got for the changes, you should be applauded for fixing things this quickly.",63,372

For me, I really enjoy Eunji's range and color. Her voice has such a bright sound to it, and it's even noticeable above her groupmates in their songs.

As far as pure color goes, I think Choa has her beat. She has a softer, warmer color and when she smiles while singing it really shines through.",187,44

1665,2016-6-18,2016,6,18,22,4oofp3,Cost of a kpop promotional cycle,Anusluvr666,1466255207,"So recently I stumbled upon [this article](https://kpopalypse.wordpress.com/2014/12/07/all-about-making-k-pop-music-videos/) and saw that making a kpop music video alone can cost from 300k-1m. So then does anyone know how expensive a full promotion cycle would cost? Because lets say the average promotion cycle is a month. That's 5 shows a week if you are a more popular group. You have the special sets that a lot of groups get for the first week with comeback stages. You have outfits that fit within the theme of the video and that will most likely will only be worn once per promotion cycle. You have to cover stylists and transportation as well. And do you have to pay to be on music shows and tv programs or is it by invitation.

One would think it would have a rather large price tag so I was just curious if anyone had some answers when it comes to this",21,77

1685,2016-6-19,2016,6,19,3,4oppqk,Opinion: Japanese Members in KPOP and the reasons for joining the KPOP Biz.,gyrobot,1466275205,"From half Talents like Cross Gene to full Japanese members like Momo and Sana. KPOP has drawn in a lot of Japanese Talent looking to make it big. But I ask myself why? Sure the official stance is they like KPOP, but a part of me just feel that is just one of the many reasons. My personal belief is that they also join because there simply nothing for them in the Japanese Market.

JPOP may be the biggest market in Japan thanks to a mix of enforced anti piracy and a focus on domestic front. But creatively for the kind of stuff Japanese performers like Momo and Sana would do, there isn't much room for them beyond being a backup dancer for Namie's sporadic releases (and she aint getting younger). Their only venues are LDH and the idol business. And the idol business is heavily dominated by the big three, Johnny's, 48G and Hello Project. None of the idol groups really values their type of talent and LDH does not brand themselves as idols to avoid being in the anti-competitive eyes of the J-Idol moguls who have gone out of their way to crush opposing talent. Looking at Momo's pre debut stuff and you see her style is very distant from what you would expect from an idol group in Japan. She is sexy, confident and cool vs the more conservative idol styles of Japanese girls. There simply isn't room for non cutesy idols in Japan and those that tried have been promoted poorly or way too unpopular.

For me a good example would be g.o.d's Park Joon Hyung. He is the oldest kpop idol in the industry that is still active. Like a lot of idol they had to fight their way up into the industry. Although money and fame might be fun Joon actually scolded the other members for buying expensive clothes after they were earning money. he said something along the lines '' why do you think you're famous? you're all about music not about looks''

 Another funny story is that he actually got blocked on his own fansite for spamming ( replying to too many fans), he knows really well that he is an idol and that with just a small gesture of a comment he can make someone day. He is just a really great person in general :)

- The 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

So I decided to make a overlooked special this week: collaborations. A lot of stuff added to Spotify through the LOEN deal wrote two or more artists as one, making it harder to find the songs. So I made a list of the ones I hunted down.  
I also made two new playlists, [Kpop Girl Groups](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/3V1Z7NTCogFnmd5cA27Ly0) and [Kpop Boy Bands](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/35AptpY28DbJDvfpw68eg0). These two playlists are based on /u/Selphade's amazing work with the youtube playlists, so all credit should go to them (I might have sneakily added a few more groups and songs though). These playlists are thought as an overview of kpop, divided by girlgroups and boybands. Let me know if I missed something that definitely should be on there!  
Back to the overlooked specials topic, would anyone be interested in a list of nugu groups on Spotify? I've found quite a few. Also, Ive been considering trying to do a compilation of all kpop groups on spotify, would anyone be interested in that? 
Lastly, is layout kpop/other okay? Or could it be improved to make artists more visible? I sometimes feel that it's easy to miss songs since there are so many releases each week... Please give me suggestions how it can be improved!  
Hope you enjoy this week's list! ^ ^",19,82

I just need your help to get my wife a truly great gift she would never expect!

So my wife's birthday is in September. Now she's a ""Closet Kpop Fan"" (or so we like to call her) but I thought I should get a head start on getting her a gift as I really want to go big here. I'm talking maybe a concert, something exclusive, a convention, etc. Just something really awesome for a Kpop fan. I would prefer an ""experience gift"" of sorts if that makes sense but anything truly Kpop she would never see coming.

So I come to you, mighty reddit, that perhaps you can give me some guidance and some killer ideas for her. Let me describe her to you.

Her Favorite boy band is EXO and (this could be the same one) the band that is half Chinese and half Korean but they sing their songs in both languages. Her favorite girl band is.. Sistar or girls generation this one I'm not positive. I know one of them has a lead singer she really likes. One of the singers songs goes like ""touch my body"" if that helps. We also like to get a ""crayon pop"" song stuck in each other's head, the one where they are in white jumpers and red bandannas at a fancy party, 

She LOVES the shows ""Return of Superman"" and ""Hello Counsler"" but I'm not sure if she's super into these shows because they really speak to her or if they are the ones she has come across first and she's been binge watching it for 6 months. 

She loves Korean culture and often says that if I die (heaven forbid) she would move to Korea/China and help N. Koreans escape. 

She watches some shows on an app called ""Drama Fever"" but I don't know which ones. Though I do remember her watching a show on hulu or netflix about a Coffee shop and a girl who pretends to be a boy but ends up falling for a guy while in her disguise making him question his sexual orientation (I don't do it justice, I actually watched parts of this show with her and enjoyed it quite a bit)

BUDGET: Here's the deal. She's been into Kpop and Korean culture for a while now. I would SERIOUSLY consider a trip to Korea in September and using the budget of both my and her birthday and Christmas gifts into something like this, but I would just have no idea how to go about doing it, are there groupons for that? ...What would be a good deal on a vacation of that nature? ...Would there be a way to easily see some of the celebrities at a event center?

Too many questions? To broad? Just let me know. Thanks guys!!

EDIT: Spelling
EDIT: Just another thought, is there like a place I could buy Kpop Swag? Tshirts and stuff maybe? Just thinking.

EDIT: We live in the Midwest (Requested to know our location :) ) You guys are awesome btw

EDIT: Thank you for the Gold kind stranger! I will for sure come up with a plan and share it with you all! ",101,193

We are reaching a point in which we need more mods. It's been awhile since we've added mods, our latest recruit was /u/AnOddName. We've made this post with an intent to expand our moderation team.

What we are looking for:

* Help with the moderation queue.
* Help with the moderator mail.

If you think you can do that, fill out the application [**HERE**](http://goo.gl/forms/zTgu7Qxw5atKovWK2).

Preferably, we are looking for moderators that are located in Europe or Asia. Even if you don't live in Europe or Asia and you are awake during those timezones, then that's totally fine as well.

EDIT: Forgot to add till when applications are open. They are **OPEN TILL JUNE 27, 2016.**

---

Along with the announcement of looking for new moderators, we have some announcements in regards to the subreddit.

* There are now two new link flairs for the subreddit which has been a long time coming which is **[Variety]** and **[Discussion]**. In regards to the latter, it did appear before with the word official as part of the link flair. However, it was not used properly when posts did have it as a flair.

* Since there are new link flairs, what's the protocol for the submission titles that do use these link flairs:

&gt; [Variety] Title of the Show E### (Date) (Who is appearing on the show?)

&gt; **EXAMPLE** [Variety] We Got Married E326 (2016.06.18) (Eric Nam/MAMAMOO's Solar)

* There are rules in regards to what is categorized as a variety show. A good example as of what you should be able to post are appearances on variety shows like Infinite Challenge, Running Man, We Got Married, Radio Star, 1 Night 2 Days, Happy Together. Keyword here is that it must include a guest that is part of the K-pop scene, so in theory it must include idols. Now, idol reality TV shows should also be listed as part Variety.

There seems to be a growing amount of bitter people lately spam reporting posts they don't like, leading automod to remove them. And they often don't get reapporoved immediately for some time since the disappearance isn't automatically noticeable. 

This seriously damages discussion and I often feel like I completely miss posts because once they get removed the /new/ queue is already filled with other new posts and the spam reported one is buried effecting its votes. 

Is there anyway to get around this? I don't know how automod works but does it work off after a post has been reported a specific amount of times its removed? Is there a way to stop automod removing posts that are reported all together (not including when auto mod removes things like wrong links)? Because I feel like this whole thing is only going to get worse. ",39,51

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.
~~~~
The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)

As butt hurt as I was with LA's (imo) stacked lineup, the concert was phenomenal! Seventeen is ridiculously in step with anoyher, ailee's set was awe-inspiring and she even got a little emotional over the crowd chanting ""ailee"" after one of her songs cut out, crush fucking crushed shit (Oasis was hype), btob has stellar vocals, and dynamic duo has some of the best stage prescence I've seen in general live performers (kpop, rap, rock, etc).  While that should've been expected, what surprised me was the improved quality in the convention itself. Was it everything I wanted? No, but it was a massive improvement over last year. The multitude of panels was nice and the short outside concerts were really rad, I'm checking out Rekstizzy and DanAKADan cause I need to rep more asian American rappers. Got some solid free stuff and they actually had a good assortment of food available! Another nice bonus was that there were multiple instances of surprise appearances by idols (including seeing mamamoo ~20ft away). Convention - 7.5/10 concert - 10/10

Can't wait for day 2!",45,54

* eating Mocha bread, also causing it to sell out in bakeries.
* for just being alive

This week I decided to add genres to the songs/albums in my other korean music-category.  Hopefully it'll make it easier to find songs that will interest you!  
I decided to save the nugu-list for another week and went with a regular overlooked-post this week. I'm still working on it, but expect it soonish.  
Also, slightly random, but I ended up looking into the mysterious Orphe Noah from this week's SM Station. He's a Swedish jazz singer that also goes under the name Gustav Karlstrm. For anyone interested, here's his [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/orpheenoah), and [here's](https://open.spotify.com/album/4GlklEgvSuwz9nnsMoSsw0) a song with Swedish latin jazz singer Graciela Chin A Loi.  
  
Edit: I just realized that I posted this on Saturday rather than Sunday as usual... This long weekend here is confusing me. If anything interesting is released tomorrow it'll be on next week's post!",8,72

I saw DR and Ryan Jhun and they talked about a lot of things from P101 to Ryan almost auditioning for Shinhwa, which was really interesting. But the concert today HOLY SHIT. First off they started with Mamamoo which was unexpected but really nice. Their set was fantastic and they're all crazy charismatic. Moonbyul though. I also saw them in the audience engagement and it sucked cause it was kinda short but they were all super chill and cool. Back to the concert. Eric Nam came next and honestly he was the one I was least hyped about but he proved me wrong. He has such a smooth voice, and he showed a lot of heart. His last song was in English and got us all pumped. Day 6 came next and I was wondering what they'd do considering them being the newest. Fuck me what they did was unexpected. They opened with letting go and then congratulations which was awesome. They then did this super bouncy song that I now have to find the name of. But they're last song was ridiculous. It was a CNBLUE-Bigbang-Wonder girls mashup (I'm a loner, lies, nobody but you) and for nobody but you they had mamamoo come out and I was feeling moonbyul's singing. And finally BTS. Let me preface this by saying im not  the biggest fan, I really like a lot of their music but I just don't get the hype. Now I understand it. They did Fire and Save Me to start and that was insane, the atmosphere of everyone was ridiculous and I couldn't help but smile and throw my hands up. But then outta nowhere THEY DID CYPHER PT 3. Holy shit. The one thing I've been wanting to see my entire life, and they delivered. Im still in awe. Honestly they did dope after and that was cool but I just went in with cypher pt 3. Fuck what a concert. Oh and Eric nam and ailee covered ""some"" and that was adorable. 

TL;DR BTS DID CYPHER PT. 3 IM STILL IN DISBELIEF

The subreddit has gone through a lot and we've worked on 16 playlists for 16 weeks together. It's all come to an end for this final playlist. Hope this mid-year has been fun!

Hopefully you guys can use the playlists we've made together to introduce people to artists, peek into new genres and learn about more unknown kpop artists.

This is the final week! Nominate your favourite kpop songs (the best ones!). Make this playlist bumpin'.


------------

##**Here are the rules (slightly altered)**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* ##**You may only nominate 5 songs.**

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **14 days** after this post **roughly this time 2 weeks from now**. At this point I will take the qualified songs and make a YouTube playlist.

2430,2016-6-26,2016,6,26,14,4pwghq,SM producers panel at KCON NY,Keto1995,1466920390,"Hi! I attended the producers panel with DR and Ryan J. (both also did 2 tracks for p101) and i dont think anyone was filming so i thought id drop a few a things they talked about here. If you were also at the panel and remember anything please comment!! it was a super interesting panel.



-Someone asked about artist involvement. Both of them agreed that although most groups have no say in what they have to perform, some of the artists (they mentioned jonghyun and taemin!) really want to be involved in a lot of aspects. Ryan seemed to really appreciate taemin's sense of artistry, he bought it up multiple times- mentioned that Taemin will fix little things in the melody himself, improvise his runs and adlibs, etc.



-Both of their favorite songs to have produced was Love Me Right. They mentioned the song took less than a week to write, but the production ended up being 3+ weeks because they bought in a live band to do the guitars, bass, etc. I thought this was really interesting because LMR really stood head and shoulders above most of exo's discog. It had a really warm and genuine sound which i guess i can attribute to the live instruments. Also on exo- both of them expressed their appreciation for Kai's singing over his rapping. 



-Favorite group to work with was.....red velvet! Ryan also mentioned hes very passionate and involved in IOI.



-Also about IOI, he's working with the subunit and Yoojung and Nayoung are writing their rap parts.



-I for taeyeon was originally an snsd song. (this really surprised me lol)



-A lot of people asked about line distribution. Ryan talked on this a bit- he said with a group like IOI he would start out by thinking of a song structure that could easily fit &gt;11 people. For other songs, he also mentioned that before he actually starts giving out the lines he'll have a loose structure for members to easily fit into; if somebody gets a lot of lines (ex. Kevin of UKISS) it's probably because their talent is more appreciated. Apparently Ryan J. reads comments on allkpop lol


thats all i can remember; if someone remembers anything else id love to read it as well!",50,233

2434,2016-6-26,2016,6,26,19,4px5v3,[Discussion] Scandals Revisited: What incidents seem like they were forgotten or deserved more attention? Or less?,killmonday,1466935679,"*EDIT: I was hoping people would clear things up on the Jisoo thing--I thought I made it clear that I don't know the whole story, since I have to rely on English translations and wasn't really able to find out much beyond the initial ""evidence"" posts--so I'm glad some of you have the truth and stuff. I should have figured she was still in the group for a reason, and I'm definitely happy to be wrong! Always open to learn!*

Consider this a step above gossip; I'm more interested in what my fellow K-Pop fans have thought about some of the incidents that graced the press in the recent past. The Korean press seems to work fascinatingly differently from its international counterparts--spill some T!

I was re-reading about Lovelyz Jisoo, and while some aspects of her scandal seem to be completely made up, there is a LOT of evidence and she basically doesn't deny much of what she was accused of--manipulating girls she previously dated. It doesn't seem fair that the main girls involved still seem to be suffering (as far as I know, anyway. I'm obviously not trying to start a fan war, and I'm open to be corrected if I'm wrong). It seems like everyone just moved past that aspect of Jisoo, or just doesn't pay attention to it. Obviously, Lovelyz shouldn't have to suffer for one person, but why did the company keep her in the group? 

On the other hand, I feel like IU got WAY too much shit for her creative interpretation of ""Zeze"" and shouldn't have had to apologize for creative license. I also don't understand why ANY celebrities issue apologies for dating each other, either.

Is there a scandal that you think didn't get enough attention? Or one that had too much attention, and was blown out of proportion?",147,20

---
First off, we're gonna be opening up user flairs to be edited by yourself. Just click ""Edit Flair"" and type in what you'd like! With the continuous new group debuts, our willingness to assign custom flairs, and our limited flair space, it's just easier this way. You're free to be creative but don't be gross, offensive, rude, etc. We reserve the right to remove flairs, forbid you from picking a flair, and issue bans if it gets out of hand. I'm trusting you guys, **SO DON'T SCREW IT UP.** ~~Also your current flair *might* disappear. I'm not sure though. If it does, blame me. This process should be live in about 15 minutes~~ 

Okay you can now edit your flair. 
#**If you see an offensive, gross, mean, or otherwise shitty flair, please report it.**

Also remember, this is /r/kpop -- try and make your flair kpop related.

---
Secondly, mod apps. We've just closed the apps -- we ended up with about 100 or so as a final count. We've already sorted through a few of them, but there's still gonna be some time before we make a final choice, how many people we add, etc -- so don't worry if you haven't heard from us yet. 

---
Thirdly, PLEASE STOP ABUSING THE REPORT FEATURE. We use Automoderator to keep an eye out and remove posts that receive a lot of reports, but please don't report stuff if it doesn't break the rules. I've spoken with admins about this in the default mods chat, they've been made aware of the report abuse and if it continues, it may result in your account being suspended from reddit as a whole..  

---
Finally, [banners](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages). As always, I'm gonna promote this. I've received some really great submissions and I'm loving everything you're all sending in. So keep sending them my way! 

Alright, that's it for now! As always, if you have any questions or concerns, just leave a comment and we'll help you out~ ",70,78

Do you want all of them to debut? Or do you think it's right to eliminate some people? If yes, who would you eliminate and why? Also, who are your favorites and why?

In my opinion, I don't think it's a bad thing if some get eliminated if they're not on par with the others (although I don't agree with the program suddenly being changed). I'm personally really hoping E'Dawn gets out of the bottom since I like him a lot. Members that I would feel least upset about if eliminated are Yuta and Yan An. (If anyone strongly disagrees with this feel free to leave some arguments and/or videos as to why I should change my mind)",24,4

2587,2016-6-28,2016,6,28,13,4q7lq7,"[Discussion] /r/kpop - When there is a new Kpop song and you check it out for the FIRST time, is it primarily about the listening experience or visual experience for you?",FluxusJeffrey,1467087955,"The reason I'm asking is, I consider kpop a music genre, which makes me think it is primarily an auditory experience. I realize though that there is visual aspect connected to kpop ('visual' is even a group role), which makes the music experience a bit different from other music genres (nothing wrong with that). 

I've been noticing a lot more in the MV release posts, people commenting first about the visual then the song itself. saying ""she's so pretty"" and ""the aesthetics are so good"" or ""the quality of the mv is really high""; or opposite, ""weak concept"" or ""feels low budget"" without actually commenting about the song itself. Some do, but it feels like the music is actually secondary to the visual content when it comes to the first time you check it out. Is it biased that way because the comments are coming from a post about a MV? or would a kpop song seem not as good if it did not come with a MV?

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.
~~~~
The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

The show will give the opportunity to underrated female idols, who have yet to gain recognition, to prove their vocal skills to viewers.

Girl Spirit will be led by PD Ma Gun Young, who was the production assistant for MBCs Infinite Challenge. This will be Mas first project as a main PD after moving to JTBC.

The show will be hosted by comedian Jo Se Ho and INFINITEs Sunggyu. Tak Jae Hoon, Jang Woo Hyuk, Chun Myung Hoon, Lee Ji Hye, and Seo In Young will appear as the contestants mentors.

2834,2016-6-30,2016,6,30,20,4ql4sj,So the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) just released an official hip hop track to promote China...[presumably] illegitimately using clips of Korean artist San E in the music video,BoraFan,1467285640,"[Link to the video here](http://www.weibo.com/3937348351/DCi6XB5V5?from=page_1001063937348351_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment). You can see excerpts from [San E's Rap Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4noDcAptlhQ) at the 0:21, 0:54 and 1:03 marks.

Whilst it obviously can't be said with certainty this was done without permission, I highly doubt San E or his label would allow his IP to be used on such a politically charged video in the first place, and indeed I can find no mention of his inclusion from him on social media. It would also be quite a bizarre move to allow footage of you rapping in your own music video to be used in another rapper's video. Quite funny considering it's supposed to be promoting the country and yet falls into one of the state's most notorious caveats: disregard for intellectual property. ",10,44

I actually have created a [poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YIW6ZbzCT1x68QnSIIYmJk8GqTOdRDj-56BOlFm0dYM/viewform) based on a couple of your suggestions so go check it out!  

For single I tried to put as many songs with official music videos that I could find, it's a very long list!

For music video I tried to just pick what seemed like the most popular, so I'm sorry if I left your favorite off.

Mini or single albums were classified as such on wikipedia AND I had to find a physical release.  If I included digital singles the list would be three times as big.  I lumped full, repackage, and special albums together just to give the category a bit more beef, not many groups released full albums.  And I decided to do a separate solo category because I think the soloist have been killing it this year.

Finally we have debut, which could be a brand new group or a singer from an existing group who has debuted as a soloist. 

Happy voting everyone, and of course feel free to discuss in the comments here :D",54,55
2840,2016-6-30,2016,6,30,23,4qm3u0,"Article: JTBC show ""Girls who can Eat"" (Food Princess) met with scathing viewer response",SpCommander,1467298729,"http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/new-jtbc-show-girls-who-can-eat-met-with-scathing-viewer-response


So I'm sure some of you remember 2-3 weeks ago we watched on V-App the live taping of that mukbang show and /u/cronodroid provided us with some great play by play.
Well it seems that the actual episode finally aired, and a lot of the comments were similar to what we had.


I know we all hate AKP links, so I will transpose below:


On June 29, JTBC's new variety show 'Girls Who Can Eat' starring A Pink's Namjoo, Nine Muses' Kyung Li, SECRET's Hyosung, Red Velvet's Seulgi, Oh My Girl's Jiho, Gugudan's Kang Mina, and TWICE's Dahyun and Tzuyu aired its pilot episode.
The pilot episode's viewer ratings achieved a mediocre 1.519%, but netizen response to the new show doesn't seem quite positive. In fact, many viewers seemed against JTBC putting a twist to a mukbang-themed show by adding girl group members when mukbang is becoming a dying trend on mainstream TV these days. Furthermore, numerous viewers seemed to find the concept of girl group members overeating a cruel concept to watch. 




Netizen comments toward the show included, ""Honestly, even for regular people, eating foods like that at night is overwhelming, so it's sad to see girl group members having to do it,"" ""This program has no humanity, just products,"" ""I only see this as a show trying to make fan wars happen,"" ""Variety shows should be enjoyable, but this is just sad,"" and more. 



To summarize, it seems that netizens saw the show as forcing the idols to stuff themselves late at night (recall this was filmed about 9pm-12am KST, and a medium to incite fan wars.
