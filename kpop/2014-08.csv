This is Billy from [GO! Billy Korean on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/gobillykorean). Earlier this year a lot of you supported my Kickstarter project to create a new book for learning Korean. That book was ""Korean Made Simple: A beginner's guide to learning the Korean language,"" and it turned out great.

Since then I've been working everyday on a sequel to pick up where the first book ends, and just today I've launched a new Kickstarter to create it. The book will be called ""Korean Made Simple 2: The next step in learning the Korean language"" and you can check out the Kickstarter project for it here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-2-the-next-step-in-learning-kor](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-2-the-next-step-in-learning-kor)

I love teaching the Korean language and I'd love if more people would start learning. AMA~!",32,58

1. [+1131,-38] Of course, they want to get criticized. Just apologize to the victims of Hiroshima like American people did.
2. [+1095,-40] Red Velvet, don't they dare immigrate here. They should be banned forever from Japan! 
3. [+997,-38] The South Koreans can't distinguish the good things from the bad things to do.
4. [+702,-22] What's the point of this?
5. [+608,-21] I want them to promote in Japan so we can boycott them. We should in fact boycott every release from this agency.
7. [+668,-26] Don't come in Japan! 
8. [+540,-11] Japanese people and Korean people have nothing in common. Coexistence is impossible for Koreans.

Link to the chart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmmeHex8hQ

Description: ""Tough week, a lot of songs growing on me left me no options but to take songs I wish I didn't have to.. Anyways, last week of July, last chance to vote this month, we are presented with NINE new entries. Will f(x) be able to keep the first place with all the rough competition on will someone else take over? PS: I did a reaction video of Red Velvet's happiness and it had a moderate success, so this week, and to reward you I'll make a reaction video to A LOT of songs. Hope you enjoy them ;D""

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song. Thanks to all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts!

I have some Super Junior concert DVDs and CDs that I'm looking to sell.  Would anyone in here be interested?  It would need to be within the United States and I think I will require that people pay via PayPal.

I have SuJu's first two concerts on DVD and their entire CD discography, including SuJu-M and SuJu-Happy.

EDIT: For pricing, I will ask $5 for CDs and $10 for the concert DVDs.  You are responsible for your own shipping, and because of that, I can actually ship out of the country if someone outside the US is interested.

EDIT AGAIN: Here are pictures to what's available.

Furthermore, there's been a lot of album/poster/etc. sales lately too for various reasons such as downsizing for college etc.

I'm sure there are better places to sell them such as eBay or Craigslist (Or maybe not better) but still, it doesn't contribute to kpop discussion much and irks me when they make it onto front page.

376,2014-8-9,2014,8,9,10,2d1afb,My Problem with Reaction Videos,twikstephen,1407548335,"In our podcast, my co-host Josh and I have offhandedly said for awhile now that most of the popular Kpop reactors aren't really honest with themselves and their audience, but we were kind of talking out of our butts. 

So I recently did a small study of the top five Kpop reaction channels where I watched all their reactions from the last 3 months and logged whether they were positive, so-so, or negative based on their comments and body language.

Between the five channels there were 120 reactions with 43 distinct artists.

* 2 out of 120 (1.7%) were bad
* 14 out of 120 (11.7%) were so-so (okay)
* 104 out of 120 (86.6%) were good

If we used a rotten tomatoes like scoring system, which lumps okay and good reviews together, then **together these 5 reaction channels have a 98.3% positive reaction (which absolutely blows my mind).** 

Individually three of the channels have a 100% positive rating, while the other two channels each disliked one video each which gave them a 96.1% positive rating.

Here is a [link to an excel sheet of my findings](http://tinyurl.com/lc85kqe), which also includes comments taken directly from the Youtube videos to provide some proof as to why I put the reaction in it's proper catagory.

I think, in general, a lot of people who watch reactions only watch reactions for groups they like. So when channel A is always agree with their own feelings, they  subscribe and feel great. I don't think they notice that most of these channels say the same generic positive statements for every single MV that's released.

Most of my feelings can be found [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnYq4cATE3s) I made about this study.

What do yall think about this? Do you notice this when you watch reactions? Do you even care? 

EDIT: I think the discussion is going in a direction I didn't mean for it to go. Sometimes I forget this is reddit and it's a totally different crowd than the ""normals/stupid people"" out there on the internet. Apparently most of yall don't ever watch reactions and you saw through their bullshit in an instant. 

It got a little lost, but one of the reasons why I did this was because I never understood why people don't see that these people are duping people who watch reactions. They are using their positive emotions to get viewers, subscribers, and money without any real original thought (with some exceptions are people hare pointed out). I totally understand WHY people want to see reactions, but NOT WHY they enjoy watching people who say the same things over and over again.",74,44

Description: ""August Week 1.. and I have to say.. I feel like its the worst week for months :x and as a consequence we have only 4 new entries this week! But on the other side this week also brings great news to you! You are now able to vote for songs that are not on the chart (Don't vote for songs that are too old, no fixed restriction, just use common sense :) ) AND the monthly charts, including July's unreleased monthly chart are now 100% fan made! As a downside though, the awards will be removed now (We have the Hall of Fame now though!).  Shout out to Hyuna's Red who got the most votes in July Week 5 and to AoA's Short Hair/Block B's Her who got the most votes in July Week 4""

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song. 

Thanks to all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts! Please leave a comment with your opinion if you feel like it :D",2,0

Isn't it funny how ZE:A is known for their dramas and variety shows than their actual music and Nine Muses is known for their music but are rarely on shows?

These ladies had so much momentum and I believed 2014 was going to be their year. People said Nine Muses peaked in 2013 but I can't believe that; they have much more room to grow. Sweetune works wonders for the ladies and I hope they get another hit like Dolls.

Shindong drops tons of nearly-impossible-to-solve hints, ELFs do their best to try and guess, and the other members get in on it to mess with the members. ~~And Donghae gets his phone confiscated so he doesn't spoil it all.~~ In 2011, ELF guessed the name of the comeback correctly. In 2012, they guessed parts of the choreography too.**

**At this point, nothing official has been announced at all -- no release date, no teaser dates, nothing. MV filming is ending either today or tomorrow, most likely. However, SMTown Seoul is coming up really soon, so the boys won't be able to hide their new hairstyles, so we're waiting for some news.**

---

**Shindong's official hints:**

Round 1:

1. OOOOO

2. 135.010 94.17

3. [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/VA3kUAh.jpg), with the caption 'find what's hidden in this shot'

Round 2:

1. do cupin

2. -

3. 'servant's cup' + 'you guys all have mirrors at home right?? hehehe thats enough of the hint kkk fighting!! Think a bit harder on it!! (trans. nksubs)

4. -------==== 

5. S512K

6. **NEW HINT: 'dream 1 hint'** (and apparently everyone's been on the wrong track)

---

**Guesses:**

Round 1:

1. some five-letter word. Eunhyuk (iirc) posted [a blurry photo on Instagram](http://photos-h.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10251355_900577359959559_586019527_n.jpg) that looked like it had five letters. It looked like 'greed' to some people, which fueled the first theory. People have since used de-blurring programs on it and gotten [an image that says [ALL] on it](https://31.media.tumblr.com/4610202ba8523778a779cee68f625d15/tumblr_na0089P5231s5xbb6o1_500.jpg), so it's presumably a photo of the lyrics sheet near the chorus where they all sing.

2. Not latitude/longitude coordinates. Searching for it got unrelated stuff and/or an IP address of a random restaurant in the US. Going by postal codes though, 135-101 is the code of Nonhyeon-dong in Seoul. At Nonhyeon-dong, Soul 94-17 there are a bunch of restaurants and one of them is called Masita (refers to the next hint). ALTERNATIVELY, Masita sounds like '' (tasty/delicious) or  (to drink) in Korean. Maybe the hint's something about food? Especially since everything has been pointing to food (restaurants, seaweed, so on). Also, Kyuhyun's fond of drinking (and food) so is it about that?

3. It's an official promo shot of the Thai seaweed brand Masita that Kyuhyun endorses. If you look in the shot, Kyuhyun has a pack of Masita ""hidden"" in his jacket, which is why people thought the second hint was referring to the Masita restaurant.

Apparently nothing that (K-)ELF guessed was right.

Round 2:

1. **ACTUALLY GUESSED CORRECTLY.** 'Do' (as in the verb to do) in Korean is ''. 'Cup' in Korean is ''. Phonetically transliterated, 'in' in Korean is ''. Putting them together gets you  , and switching the order gets you  which means cruel. Shindong posted on SJ's DC Gallery again confirming that this was right, and clarifying the next hint.

2. '' is the Korean name of [SJ's All My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0gR9nnoWHs). '' means lyrics. In the lyrics of All My Heart, there's one line that contains both '' and '': ****  ****   , which translates to 'you shine front of me and erase all my sadness'. ALTERNATIVELY, '' can mean either eye or snow. '' means rain, and the boys have been tweeting about the torrential rain in Seoul for a while. Is the comeback weather- or rain-related?

3. Lots of random guesses relating to theory #2 (the Roman cup-bearer, Cupid, etc.). Cupid was incorrect as were paso double and Mexico.

4. Multiple ideas (like theory #3 mentioned below), but nothing concrete.

5. September 5th 12:00 K(ST) --&gt; release date?

---

**Theories:**

1. At the beginning, someone thought [this blurry IG photo](http://photos-h.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10251355_900577359959559_586019527_n.jpg) said 'greed'. That ended up with some fans coming up with an elaborate theory of the comeback being about the seven deadly sins (all the food could be related to Gluttony).

2. Something to do with mythology? Multiple members had been tagging their SNS updates with stuff like #gotosleep #whyareyouallawake #youshouldbesleeping #goingtosleepnow. Is that a reference to the comeback? Morpheus is the god of sleep, and there are 10 main Roman/Greek gods. 10 gods = 10 members, plus the rest of the hints could be taken to be this way too. Every member is wearing a different color in their SS6 promotional video too.

3. Shindong not participating in the comeback/being the filming director. Taking the - hint, the line it may refer to could be saying 'I'm in front'. 'Servant's cup' could be saying Shindong's doing all the servant's work, and the mirror refers to him switching roles -- being on the other side of the camera. For the hint -------==== , you can find 9 (is 1 and if you transpose: -4-1-2-1-2-1-1+1+1+1=9). LT+HC+KI+SD+SM+EH+SW+DH+RW+KH would make 10 members. But if Shindong's not here, it would be 9.  (cr: fuelu @tumblr)

4. The title has to do with 7. In the context of music, '' means 'volume' in the sense that a group's third album is 3, fourth is 4 and so on. That would make this (their seventh album) 7, but everybody involved (all the members, all the staff members/directors/choreographers/etc.) has been saying 'SJ7' instead of '7'. Could the album be titled 7 or something similar? SM already did something like this with TVXQ's Tense album earlier this year, saying that part of the reason they chose to title it that is because 'tense' sounds like ten/tenth, and it was the tenth anniversary.

---

**Extras:**

Most of the boys have been updating on SNS and trolling hard (as usual).

* Ryeowook posted [this photo](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t6fZkIa15B4/U-WpyoQrLtI/AAAAAAAAk-s/C0yrgH4TeIQ/s1600/BuiMfJbCAAARKYL.jpg-large.jpeg) with the caption 'We're BACK ! Su!Per!Ju!Nior!'...but it's a shot from MV filming for their *last* comeback.

* Eunhyuk posted [this photo](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PwouOkk4FcU/U-WrA6SJ5lI/AAAAAAAAk_A/w72ts6dMgbc/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-08-09+at+1.00.11+pm.png) with the caption ""here. #real #hint #7jib #SuJucomeback #justkidding #gotosleep"". The photo is of fish bait or '', which can also mean hint in the way that Shindong's been using it.

* Eunhyuk posted [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H-R33M-SJBY/U-WqV9vsZjI/AAAAAAAAk-0/_1UE0o6Hk-I/s1600/BujtUZICIAApJ_r.jpg) with the caption 'a picture (taken) during mv filming! #IDidntSayItWas7jib #gotosleep'. Again, this is a shot from their *last* comeback.

* Kangin posted [this shot](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JXfHYYrprRA/U-WsvJYSPcI/AAAAAAAAk_U/s92rsvrQT4c/s1600/BukleU9CMAAIWEo.jpg) of his eye with the caption ""my eye's bruised  ah why do I keep waking up  I should be sleeping a lot~~"".

* They've been posting random stuff (like videos of the rain in Seoul, shots of the edges of the filming monitors, stuff about how they're getting three hours of sleep, how they're still filming...and all being very careful to not show anything like their new hair colors or anything about what/where they're actually filming.

* Rumors are saying that 1. they filmed at a coffee shop and 2. this may be one of the first kpop MVs that's filmed (at least partly) underwater.

---

**The real takeaway from all of this:**

1. **Super Junior is again doing a better job of promoting themselves than SM (which has basically been the case for a few years now). Shindong is single-handedly not only keeping the interest level high for this comeback, but bringing it to a fevered pitch -- and nothing about the comeback itself has even started.**

2. **ELFs are still around, and we're thirsty as fuck. Over two years between comebacks has raised the anticipation to unbelievable levels. (SJ/ELF have trended worldwide four times in the last two-three days and again -- nothing about the comeback has even started!)**

And inb4 ELF being delusional about the concepts -- we know very well that the odds of any of these concept guesses being right are unthinkably slim. That doesn't make it any less exciting to try guessing, especially when the members keep consistently replying to our guesses.

I'd love to get engrossed into newbie groups, but not many of them have forums that are active, or if they do have active forums, they don't have many subbed videos for me to watch. I remember when kpop idol forums were so popular and had their respective sub team, but now I feel like the forum scene is declining along with subbed videos. I really wish that wasn't the case. I can't find any new subbed videos for my  favorite groups on their respective forums. The forums have slowly ceased to exist :(

Where I normally get my kpop fix is from allkpop but I'm trying to avoid that site as much as possible, if I can help it. But I wanted to let /r/kpop to know that after a long sabbatical from kpop, I'm intrigued to to get back in, and that /r/kpop has definitely helped me do that! Thanks ya'll :)",8,5

But I did see SNSD as a group before they entered the stage. **My goodness** they are gorgeous.

This was my first time attending and I want to be sure that I am not crazy for being underwhelmed with the con. The concert was amazing....  But the convention was so disappointing.  Besides long lines and the heat,  I was expecting more to do within the convention.  I was was wanting to spend a lot of money on merchandise I can't get anywhere else. 

To be more clear,  I was in line outside of the convention till 2:30pm. So I missed a lot of panels.  I was really looking forward to hearing people talk about the culture that I love so much. I did make it to two workshops.  That were awesome. But besides those I was let down with the stuff that was inside the con.  The free market was cool.  But I felt like the con was a little boring. 

Also it seemed like the organizers had no idea how to run a convention. The line was wrapped around the block but there was no one in the convention. Wtf. Then the line was around the block for the concert too. I know some people missed seeing Vixx,  which is awful. 

Anyone else feel this way?",65,22

APink's BuBiBu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5biZzDIFdA

- My friends think this song is way too cute to listen in the car all by yourself or especially when others are around. My friends said they would disown me if I played this song out loud when they're around. 

Secret's Starlight Moonlight - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTVfJ1j7o-A

- When I first heard this song I thought it was different, cute, and sweet. Secret had shown their sexy side but with this song also proved they had a cute side as well. My friends also threatened me with violence if I ever played this song while they were in the same car as me. 

How about you? What Kpop songs do you like that your friends or family just hate. ",69,32

Even female acts, though, like Britney Spears and Taylor Swift or Little Mix, their fans would be mostly female, too, right? It seems like, in the West, pop music is built mainly around female fans.

Is it the same in Korea or is it more mixed? I know Crayon Pop is famous for its popjussi, but I'm wondering if that's just an anomaly. My only window into kpop is sites like reddit, which probably aren't representative of Korean fans (and male-heavy, to begin with).

If I went to, say, an SNSD concert in Korea, would the fans be mostly male, mostly female, or evenly mixed?",26,39

As the girls were being introduced, the MCs brought up the fact that Hana used to go by Zinger as her stage name. 

Sung Si Kyung joked, ""It's probably because she got mistaken for a burger a lot"" (In reference to the KFC Zinger Burger). Hearing this, fellow MCs Shin Dong Yup, Heo Ji Woong and Hong Suk Chun asked, ""Wait, really? Is that really the reason?""

Hyosung chuckled and said, ""She was pushed aside by the burger..."" and Hana admitted it really was the case. ""If you would search my name, you'd get more results about the burger first. So I decided it wasn't going to work out,"" she said.

Or will Infinite or Happiness steal their place? Check out the chart to find out! Shout out to Red Velvet's Happiness who got the most votes last week!""
How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song.

[Here's the video again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj4rn1I_dC8)

*taken from [fyeah-vixx's translation of Leo's Ceci Interview](http://fyeah-vixx.com/post/95034160596/interview-ceci-september-2014-a-bitter-serenade)*

&gt;*VIXXs promotions for &lt;Eternity&gt; have ended, and now you have Lyn and Leos project album release coming up (The interview took place on July 31st).*

&gt;The title Blossom Tears fortells picking out petals one by one, He loves me, he loves me not. Its a story about a man who carries a sad fate and the woman he loves, Lyn sunbae-nim personally wrote the lyrics. She explained the lyrics well, so it was a lot of help when we recorded.


&gt;*What kind of story did you personally tell in the music video?*

&gt;I play the role of a man who has been hurt by the woman he loves because she left him. After that, he kills the people he loves so that they can never leave him, a psychopath that wants complete ownership over them. Since theres no script and I had to change my emotions like a rollercoaster with details, the acting was really hard but it ended well because the staff was really helpful.",1,26

I like Kara's *Pandora EP*, and the song *Step* from the album of the same name but not the album itself. I like AOA's *Miniskirt*, *Moya*, and *Red Motion* EPs. Apink's *Pink Blossom*, *Une Anne*, and *Secret Garden* are also good.
I also like HyunA's solo career, and 2NE1's second mini album ( I like the songs *Ugly* and *Hate You*), as well as Secet's *Secret Summer*. And finally, Girls' Generation's *I GOT A BOY*, and *LOVE&amp;PEACE*.",29,8

She was just the visual and didn't contribute much to the group musically. She was a lazy dancer and the group's performances may even be more exciting now without her apathy. I have nothing against her I just don't understand why it's as disruptive as people are making it out to be.

Throughout 2013, I lived in South Korea and had a chance to interview a few K-pop groups for a website. A good chunk of what I have never saw the light of day due to horrid publicity on the site owner's part so i'm looking to FINALLY get some of them out there. I want to run a test to see if I should continue this, should I have a way to get in touch with previous groups and gain relationships with new groups. 

The first group I interviewed was Nu'est and I enjoyed my moment with them. If you have seen this before, awesome. If not, give it a look see! Many thanks!

Does anyone know any options online through which I could buy tickets while I'm still in the US? Or would the best option be to get tickets when I get to Japan?

1049,2014-8-23,2014,8,23,18,2ecswd,[Article] Cube artists and their earnest sincerity for Lou Gehrig disease,radhumandummy,1408787046,"[Translated article](http://loveindacube.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/10asia-cube-artists-and-their-earnest-sincerity-for-lou-gehrig-disease/) (the whole chunk of quoted text below)

[Original 10Asia article](http://tenasia.hankyung.com/archives/302517) (also linked at the end of translated link)

&gt; In order to raise awareness for Lou Gehrig disease, the ice bucket challenge has been a wide trend lately. The ice bucket challenge was initiated by America Lou Gehrig Association (ALS) in order to help patients diagnosed with the disease. The event started in America in July but became a global movement, including Korean artists, such as Choi MinSik, Yoo JaeSuk participated in it. 24 hours after being nominated, the nominee will have to pour ice water or donate USD 100 to the association. He/she can then call out 3 names to continue the campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; As the event proceeds, it has raised good responses as celebrities take on the challenge and/or donate to the association. Although some did take it as a joke or as a publicity stunt, celebrities that are sincere in their delivery of these meaningful messages have gained attention.
&gt; 
&gt; Among many of them, artists of Cube Entertainment have raised awareness in a different way. Singer-cum-actor Rain participated in the ice bucket challenge on the 23rd of August, and have also decided to donate 100 million Won for the research of ALS disease. In the video of him taking on the ice bucket challenge, he revealed, My teacher and father-like person who has made me into where I am today is fighting the disease in his third year and, I frustrated on how I could help him as an expression of my gratitude and thankful heart and with that reason, he had revealed to had donated 100 million Won instead of 100 dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; The person who Rain mentioned was none other than Cube Entertainments President Hong Seung Song. President Hong started his management experience since in the 1990s with Lee Yerin, which had soon led him to be a co-representative of JYP Entertainment. After leaving JYP Entertainment, he then moved on to establish Cube Entertainment, and has held the president position till of now. Diagnosed with Lou Gehrig Disease, he has raised artists BEAST, 4minute, G.NA, BTOB and more who are under the label company.
&gt; 
&gt; The incident of President Hong having Lou Gehrig disease had to be handled cautiously, and Cube artists have participated in activities regarding to rare diseases including Lou Gehrig, expressing their sincere heart in a quiet manner. BEAST members have personally met up with a teenager battling with the same disease, and were even appointed ambassador for a Respiratory Rehabilitation Center.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of that, the ice bucket challenge that helps to fund for Lou Gehrig research, has become a point where Cube artists can express their hearts earnestly. Cube artists have participated in the ice bucket challenge and were always nominating fellow Cube artists as the next challenger. BEAST Yoon Doojoon chose BTOB Seo Eunkwang, while Seo Eunkwang chooses A Pink Bomi, A Pink chooses G.NA and Rain, further raising the wave of the ice bucket challenge among fellow colleagues. They chose each other not because they were colleagues, but as a way to express their sincere heart and respect for President Hong SeungSong.
&gt; 
&gt; Their sincere thoughts can be seen in their videos. The whole member of A Pink courteously wore black shirts in their ice bucket challenge video. NaEun took the chance to say, We hope that there is a recovery method that will treat patients soon, while Rain even donated generously for the research of ALS disease.
&gt; 
&gt; The staff from Cube entertainment, too, have plans to raise more awareness for the campaign. Representatives from Cube Entertainment expressed, Cube artists have a different heart towards Lou Gehrig Disease and, In the future too, we will bring the campaign, including this ice bucket challenge to another practical level. Cube artists have shown their sincerest and earnest sides more than anyone else in the campaign, as it reflects their true inner thoughts.

Major props to them, that's all I can say.",7,44

Hi /r/kpop! 

So after watching Girl's Day - Darling in 60fps from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2ci8vw/girls_day_darling_in_60fps/) and reading all the comments, I decided to get the interpolation setup myself and convert some videos too. 

Here is the [popular guide](http://www.spirton.com/convert-videos-to-60fps/) that people linked to that I used to get the setup.

---
/r/60fpskpop if you want to request an MV to be converted, post there or PM me directly. My internet is slow these days, so I will probably only convert if I get a high quality source.

---

**November Update: Youtube can now host 60fps!** The glorious 60fps revolution is finally here :) It's only a matter of time before Kpop MVs in 60fps becomes the standard among the industries &lt;3

For now, here are some 60fps Kpop Channels you should follow + support:

1. Our new **[Apink60f channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Apink60f)** holds all Apink MVs in the best possibly quality. Please support us!

2. **[60fps kpop](https://www.youtube.com/user/60fpskpop)**, made by /u/snsdfour3v3r (whom is also the creator of /r/60fpskpop )

3. **[HDfps60](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Y2wdv4BkWocbbVnbjWj3g/videos)**, hosts all AOA MVs + other girl group MVs/Lives (made by /u/clu3d)

---

**Here's the list!** *Note that webms are for convenience and are low quality, if you download it is much better quality*

*I recommend cntrl-f + putting in your song/favorite group to easily look if something's here*

###Ones I converted/uploaded:

1096,2014-8-25,2014,8,25,8,2ehgbc,Is the new direction for Sunny Hill good or bad?,[deleted],1408924432,"When I first started listening to kpop, I wanted to know how different the music itself was from the US UK Japan and the rest of the world. I wanted to know how much influence other styles like jazz, rock, hip-hop. or funk was incorporated into the music. As I was searching I came across Sunny Hill's ""Midnight Circus"", and I was blown away by how unique the music and concept was. So I obviously became a fan. I looked into it and saw that there was three in the group in the beginning and they were kinda of like a ballad group. Then they got their fourth with label changes that, but all that's besides the point. They released the single ""Pray"", which I thought was going to be on an upcoming album which would have been an amazing album if there was songs surrounding that one. And it turned out to be just a single. Then they released the Grasshopper Album which was good too and then the White Horse is coming and then Goodbye to romance ended the year. So through that short time between 2011-2012, they have made some serious changes music wise. I wasn't really excited about all of their music that they were making but I was still board in hope that they would do something like midnight circus or pray again. Then they surprisingly went into folk music with Young Folk. So now my view of Sunny Hill's style completely changed. I knew that they were staying with more softer music instead of stunning concepts, fast progressive music and powerful meaningful ballads. So fast forward to now with the single ""Monday Blues"". The chorus of the song is pretty nice I guess, and the rest of the song is ok but I'll say it right now that I'm not a fan at all with  the ""sexy"" like concept. I became a fan because they were so good at producing great music with an abstract concept. In the video they are being presented as sex objects with showing cleavage, raising the skirt in the choreography, and looking ""seductively"" into the camera. There must have been a change in producer for this concept for them to come up like this. But I honestly feel like if the next singles or albums focus on them being sexy, then I might not stay a fan for too long. I know this was really long but I really enjoyed  the music and concepts that was produced by the Sunny Hill Team. It would be very disappointing to see them go out like this. I would really like to know someone else's thoughts on this. ",21,6

feel free to ask me any questions heh

Hope you're having a wonderful day! I'm posting an opportunity on behalf of JYP Entertainment for talented songwriters and producers to submit their work for a chance to get signed. We're running an open audition for songwriters and producers, and I thought it would be a great chance for members of the community to showcase their work. Genres we are looking for include Pop, Dance, Electronic, R&amp;B, Soul, Ballad, Hip Hop, and Urban. Here's a link to the audition details and an application form: http://english.jype.com/#/company/NoticeView.aspx?idx=22


Feel free to post any questions you might have in this thread as well (please try to keep them on topic), and I'll answer them as soon as possible. Additionally, if you know anyone who might be interested, even if they're not totally familiar with the Kpop scene, please let them know about this opportunity - the more the merrier!


I apologize for the lack of post history on this account! We (the JYP team based in Los Angeles) are long time readers/lurkers of reddit, but felt that we should create an account with an official name to represent the label. At any rate, I'm hoping to speak with many of you soon!",123,198

I know they were trained for it and also because of the choreography but what's the point? You can still dance while using the mic in your right hand. I'm not hating on K-pop or K-pop groups (I also like the groups using their left hand to hold their mics and sing.) but this is just my curiosity. 

P.S. I did a die-hard research on this topic but there's nothing.

P.S. #2 I know some of them or all of them in that K-pop group you might be thinking are all left-handed people (Not really all but some of them.) but I'm talking to the groups that are mostly left-handed.

P.S. #3 There are actually performances of K-pop groups using their right hand to sing but I'm talking to the performances who use their left hand.",1,2
