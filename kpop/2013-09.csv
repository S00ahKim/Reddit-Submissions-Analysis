84,2013-9-4,2013,9,4,13,1lozbx,Weekly 80/90 Artist - Shin Haechul,[deleted],1378267315,"This week's artist is popularly referred to as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" or Mawang, in Korea. As peculiar and tumultuous as Shin Haechul's career has been, his music has always been experimental and inspirational since his arrival in 1988.  

A gifted songwriter and composer, Shin first gained recognition by winning the prestigious MBC University Music Festival in 1988 with the group Moo Han Gwe Do. The short-lived group only lasted an album, but the song that won the festival, ""To You,"" had a tremendous reception. It remains one of his representative songs to this day.  

* [To You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dHcVjj_Kq0)  

In 1990, Shin released his first solo album, ""Don't Make A Sad Face,"" to great success. The record was just the beginning of his many forays into various types of music, which would later range from ballads, jazz, rock, progressive rock, midi, rap, techno, metal and pop. The song ""Goodbye"" is notable as the first-ever Korean song to contain an English rap, while the lyrical ballad of the album's namesake established Shin as a formidable chart-topper.     

* [Don't Make A Sad Face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_EJ0lDCaZw)  
* [Goodbye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3Vd2KNRCk)  

His second album, ""Myself,"" was one of the top records of 1991 and is largely considered a representative record of the early '90s, period -- in addition to ""Jazz Cafe"" being one of the first songs in Korean music to use midi, ""Letter I Write To Myself"" remains a go-to song for struggling youth everywhere with its memorable lyrics and Shin's narration.  

* [Letter I Write To Myself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyT4KjintZY)  
* [Jazz Cafe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbfm2H_aMng)  

Shin formed the rock band N.EX.T in 1992. An icon of '90s Korean experimental, techno and pop rock, N.EX.T's first album, written and composed by Shin, was lauded as a fresh breath of air. The song ""The Citizens,"" which describes the loneliness and throttling normalcy of modern city people, was a huge hit.  

* [The Citizens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p67uMWcIGXk)  
* [Driver of a Doll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOGzJmRHUdE)  

The band's second record, which is listed at No. 38 on the 100 Greatest Korean Albums, shifted largely to heavy metal and progressive rock. The sentimental track ""Fly Chick,"" the heavy metal smasher ""The Destruction of the Shell,"" and ""The Ocean,"" considered one of the band's greatest hits, are all important listens.  

* [Fly Chick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X41UVzR1qI)  
* [The Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR0Rug5QVic)  
* [The Destruction of the Shell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD8sQEYJfJ4)  

N.EX.T split in 1997 and then returned in 2003. Shin, in the meanwhile, has been mixed up in numerous drug scandals (namely, marijuana) and has gained a cult following for his music and his outspoken political and social views, which can all be seen reflected in his music in both the past and the present.

Oh jeez I hope I'm doing this right. I also hope I am not breaking any rules here, as the previous post I did was over a year old and I am doing this to raise visibility.

Anyway, it was about a year ago that I made a post advertising a kpop Plug DJ Channel I had made. Since then Kpop has become much bigger, people went crazy for PSY and then SNSD had a comeback and now EXO are turning people crazy. 

I am advertising this channel again as the community has gotten much bigger and the channel is losing members as I have been on Hiatus for a few months.

The room is a friendly place for people to hang out and talk about kpop, or you can leave it on in the background at work or while you play games!

**So what is Plug DJ you ask?**

Well it is a website currently in beta similar to existing websites like turntable fm. People take it in turns to be the DJ, where they get to choose a song that everyone listens to. People can then upvote or downvote the song!

**Did you make this website?**

Oh god no, I simply made a room dedicated to Kpop, where fellow kpoppers can hang out.

**What can I play?**

Anything Kpop, be it MV's, live stages or Japanese songs by Korean artists.

We are not personally attacking any fanbases. In fact, this may be an opportunity for people to provide a counter-perspectives that may potentially change initial opinions. With that all out of the way, I can start: 

* SNSD would be a more likable group for me if Hyoyeon and Sooyoung were never included. I don't think they bring much to the group musically/visually and quite frankly, their personalities tend to annoy me. 
* I don't think HyunA deserves all the attention she has historically received. Considering the amount of solo work she is provided, I would have expected her singing to be very good (and it is not). 
* I don't like when certain idol groups have particular members designated as rappers (and rappers only). It pretty much tells me right away that they do not have a very good voice which ends up being a turn-off in regards to my liking of that group (but there are always exceptions, of course). And for the most part, these rappers have filler parts in songs that are very forgettable, IMO.

I'd like not to let her know that I already ordered it, so her copy is going on my shelf and as soon as the other one gets here, probably in three or so weeks, I'd like to ship it out to a good home.

Note that I'm totally willing to just give this away.  No shipping required, either (unless you're in some really insane place that will cost a ridiculous amount).  If you're interested, please comment here, and on Wednesday I will choose someone completely at random and send them a message (I'll post in this thread, too, so that the people that are interested aren't left hanging).

EDIT: Wow, guys! Thank you for such an excellent response! I wasn't even sure I'd get more than one or two replies! I'm glad there's so much interest!

EDIT2: First off, thank you to everyone that came in and replied. The feedback I've gotten from this has been absolutely wonderful. 

Due to having so many responses (90 comments! Wow!) on this post I decided that the best way to decide the winner would be to roll a 100 sided die (or percentile dice in this case, because actual 100 sided dice are crazy and I don't own one). The first number came up as a 93, so was rerolled. Second time I rolled a 44, so I went up 44 posts from the bottom and the winner is /u/sunjino! So congratulations Sunjino, and thank you again to everyone else for participating. If I ever find myself with an extra copy of another album, I'll be sure to post again!",80,21

It's about a boy remembering his girlfriend who died. An explanation from Wikipedia:

&gt;The song is actually about the main character pretending that his girlfriend is still alive when she died at ""0330"", military time for 3:30am. Shin Dongho served as the main actor for the music video. It starts with a piano in the middle of the forest with a clock switching to 03:30. Romantic scenes follow as the song goes on. But in the middle of the video, a short flash back has been showed that Dongho is just pretending that he is with the girl, but in fact, he's not. He doesn't want to accept that the lady was dead so he goes along with life doing everything he did with her pretending she is still with him. His friends are helping him along the way knowing that it is hard for him, but they don't want to see their friend suffer. They are trying to teach Dongho to move on and begin with a new life. He then accepted the fact that she is gone and faced the reality. On the bridge of the song, U-KISS is standing on the roof top of a building in autumn's air. The video ended with a dream, Dongho teaching the girl in white how to play the piano.

So I've noticed most comebacks have a title track, and once promotions for that track finishes, there's another track that is promoted (from the album itself or the repackage title single). I'm curious, what are your top 5 favourite follow-up singles?

I collect CDs of every artist I listen to; when I got into J-Rock a long time ago, I discovered YesAsia and I've used it ever since. I find them to be somewhat pricy,but they offer free shipping for orders over 25$.

However, just recently I decided to check out kpopmart. I noticed they have a nice ""Free poster with preorder"" policy,along with very strangely low prices on new CDs...of course, I soon came to realize this is because they charge ~10$ USD for shipping. It still came out about ~5$ cheaper than YesAsia,however.

So,what do you all use?",22,17

294,2013-9-11,2013,9,11,14,1m5q1u,[Discussion] Have any of you thought what Big Bang would have been like if YG took Hyunseung (of B2ST) rather than Seungri?,Cuv,1378877612,"Looking B2ST's past comebacks I really see Hyunseung as a standout. His dancing is strong and flawless-looking, and I'm loving his singing voice.  There's something really pure about it, and I wished he had more of a role in Shadow :/

The problem I have with Seungri is I literally can't point him out in most BB songs, as Taeyang (who usually sings a big chunk of each song) has a similarish pitch/singing style with Seungri imo.  The fact that he sings like 1-5 lines per song isn't helping at all either :/. If he had a voice in any way different I think I'd appreciate him more, but I think Hyunseung would have brought some variety to the group, and possibly sound better overall.

I know he's not the best at variety shows and stuff, but I'm thinking in actual musical terms.

^^And ^^I'd ^^take ^^Hyunseung's ^^silentness ^^over ^^Seungri's ^^overconfidence ^^anyday ^^&gt;_&gt;


**EDIT:** For those who don't happen to know, Seungri and Hyunseung were initially kicked out of Big Bang during it's formation, but YG decided to take Seungri back, and leave Hyunseung to do whatever

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(South_Korean_band)#2000.E2.80.932005:_Formation

I believe there's the documentary still on Youtube somewhere that shows their progress of BB as trainees and how Seungri/Hyunseung was cut and Seungri was brought back.

v2 will be completely different, with a focus more on creating a community platform for K-POP fans. We're working with all the companies in Korea for this launch, with artists confirmed to be onboard for general interaction with fans (they will have accounts and post occasionally, respond to questions, etc). 

It's going to be super exciting, and we know that it's something everyone has been waiting for; something new in K-POP. 

Reddit is probably the best place I can think of to find beta testers, so for those who are interested, please send me a PM and we will create a separate list for all of you!

We're also looking for people to help moderate and curate new content on Koreaboo. Please e-mail me at flowsion@koreaboo.com if you are interested in this. We are specifically looking for people to help us manage our social channels starting immediately! Those who join our team in this will recieve exclusive access to events, invitations to join us on shoots, free merchandise &amp; more~

Thank you to the community of /r/kpop for always supporting Koreaboo, and we will definitely continue to help host more AMAs and support Reddit in the future :).",20,28

471,2013-9-21,2013,9,21,12,1mtipk,This is my opinion on what the future is for 2NE1.,JavelinAMX,1379734347,"In all honesty, and to be frank, they are royally, ROYALLY fucked.


First off, they simply need to have a culture change, and fast. Look at ANY English interview and its pretty much CL bearing the load with the rest of the members nodding, along with CL feeding false and bullshit answers about how different their music is, when in reality its the same tripe from American Pop circa 2000. This is simply unacceptable. Minzy, Dara and Bom ALL need to step up and interact more with the outside sphere of Western influence. For fuck's sake, Dara LIVED IN THE PHILLIPINES FOR YEARS. There's a good jumping off point right there.


Secondly, they need to outsource at least some of their work. The fact that Teddy or any other YG-approved producers do most of their work is doing ALL the producing is a disgrace. Considering that Teddy has pretty much exhausted all the musical creativity he has, its high time that YG look at other producers. As much as I hate the little shit, GD would be my first place to start. This reliance on company resources just goes to show that the company needs to outsource fast, as the two producers they have are swamped, and creatively spent.
Third, either dump Dara and Bom, or retool them as see fit. These two are literal dead weight, no matter which way you slice the onion. Bom is literally nails on a chalkboard when you take into account how fucked her voice is, and Dara does absolutely jack shit. Maybe it would be best that YG, I dunno, make her sing more low-key, less vocally intensive notes and songs? And for Dara, just dump her already. Considering the little she does in the actual music, and the fact she acts likes she's 12 constantly when she's encroaching on 30, it would probably be for the best.


Fourth, GET THEM ALL OUT THERE. Aside from the music shows for comebacks, they do literally NOTHING until YG orders them back into the studio like a herd of cows. This needs to change. Get them on shows, let Dara act, get Minzy dancing, anything. The fact that we literally hear nothing aside from the odd vague and useless tweet is a joke. Remember Double Park TV? Oh wait, its dead in the water like any other attempt to get the group more known, and make them do something.


The last point however reverts back to the top. The empty promises and lies need to stop. I am getting absolutely sick and tired of hearing vague dates for comebacks by YG. Either shut your mouth until you KNOW that the comeback is set in stone, or don't talk at all and drop it by surprise. YG seems to be absolutely inept at trying to please the fans and instead spin the hype machine until it drops dead. Not only is this a horrible way to gain trust in your fans, but it also is also making Papa YG the boy who cried wolf: Why should I care about my favorite group's release when its probably going to be delayed or denied?


Its pretty obvious that 2NE1 is just barely holding onto it's ""Elite Girl Group"" status. The fact that so little is done, that management takes pleasure in fucking around the group when it fits them, and that YG believes its just to fuck the fans around the block makes it such a bitter pill to swallow. It is pretty much a given that YG cares way more about pleasing his stockholders then giving the fans even the littlest bit of good news to cherish.
This group is on life support, and the way things are going, its a matter of time before 2NE1 hits flatline.

Instead I decided to share K-Pop song chords that I've figured out. I scanned my notebook and put them in an imgur album, as that was easier than typing them all out.

[Here is the album](http://imgur.com/a/OY2jB)

Edit: Some songs are missing chords, there is either a star by the song or a ? mark where the chord needs to be.

Maybe it's because he doesn't have many followers on Twitter, but he announced just yesterday that KPOP is coming to Canada!

He has worked along side SHINee, Super junior, EXO plus many more in the SM Entertainment business!

Follow him, and get ready because he left for Korea last night as well, and still hasn't made the official announcement!
He keeps re-tweeting people asking him to bring the bands to Toronto, England, and Vancouver!

GUYS, KPOP IN CANADA.

This probably gets asked a lot, but since the music industry is constantly changing, it's good to return to this once in a while. I think some good groups out there are generally ignored because they aren't (usually) signed to The Big 3. I know I like A-JAX and Wonderboyz, but I usually never see them get talked about. I feel like I'm missing out on some really good music just because of lack of exposure :/

So who are some artists that you like, nugu or just plain ignored, that you like? And it doesn't have to just be kpop, it could be k-rock, k-hiphop, k-indie, etc.

642,2013-9-29,2013,9,29,2,1nblfb,[Radio] Bringing K-Pop to the San Francisco Bay Area on 92.3FM every Sunday from 6pm to 9pm,ufmjohnathan,1380389907,"I have been trying to tell everyone that there is a K-Pop radio show in the Bay Area through real life interactions with random people, a Facebook page, and other social mediums but have not yet tried Reddit.  It's my 1st post so I hope this helps spread the word and brings more listeners to the station and show the managers there is a huge audience that will tune in.

For the longest time while I drove to and from work I always wished there was a K-Pop radio station.  I got sick and tired of listening to the same thing over and over again.  I found myself changing the station a lot and even started to listen to AM radio just to escape the daily tedium.  Long story short, I am now the host for the show.  The Bay Area is so diverse I think we should have something like this 24/7, not just 3 hours a week and was hoping this forum might be able to help.

Here is what it says(translation thanks to [@kekihoon](https://twitter.com/kekihoon)):

&gt;I absolutely cannot stand those people who call us or spam our kakaotalk chats with messages even in the middle of the night, and people who secretly follow us everywhere no matter where we go. Is there a meaning in this? I really hate people disturbing my life! I love shopping, eating and meeting my friends, but I dislike people following me around, I am not a criminal! I am not going out to commit a crime! I only want to peacefully rest after work, and have my own personal space! Not to be stuck in my current situation! 

You can clearly see he is really angry. And I can't blame him. I mean not only they follow them around but sasaengs know their phone numbers and kakaotalk chat.",25,86
