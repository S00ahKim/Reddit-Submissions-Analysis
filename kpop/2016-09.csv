&gt; Many citizens in their 30s chose H.O.T and those of that age and older preferred g.o.ds music, while the 10s and 20s were disposed to vote towards EXO, BIGBANG, and Super Junior. The experts noted that 2007 and 2008 were important years in the history of idol music, with the release of BIGBANGs Lies and Wonder Girls Tell Me as well as the debuts of Girls Generation and SHINee.

&gt; There were also some differences between genders, with women likely to choose Tell Me by the Wonder Girls and SISTAR as a group while men leaned towards Gee and TWICE. 10 Minutes and Bad Girl Good Girl also showed high preference among women rather than men.",114,101

219,2016-9-3,2016,9,3,19,50y9tu,[Meta Discussion] Could we have another post by the mods like this?,1408_,1472898364,"I was looking through the subreddit and stumbled upon [this post made by the mods a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3f2ueh/state_of_the_subreddit_feedback_welcome/), discussing the state of the sub. 

I bring it up again to discuss in particular the guidelines surrounding discussion posts and group specific posts. Because it seems to me it's become extremely muddled these days. Not just among users, but apparently based off the stuff mods remove and what they allow too. I can't help but notice that types of content that use to be allowed is now being removed and vice versa. This type of inconsistency in my opinion, doesn't help anyone. 

I've been on this sub a long time now (different accounts through the years) and it seems like this has always been the case, but with the growth of this subreddit and content (as well as the addition of some new mods - not tryna @ anyone) it's gotten a lot more obvious that real guidelines are needed. I feel like right now things are being allowed and removed based on each individual mod. 

So my question is: is anything being done to help this or can anything be done to help this? I mean I guess there are some rules in place but they don't specify much. 

It's in my opinion that it's never a good thing for a sub when moderators don't have clear guidelines to follow when removing/allowing content and I think that's the biggest problem that has caused this inconsistency. ",21,60

232,2016-9-4,2016,9,4,0,50zah0,[Fan Account] 2016 Incheon Sky Festival,jolaurence,1472916614,"Alright everyone. Here is my recap of the Incheon Sky Festival. Note: I am heavy, heavy, *heavy* CNBLUE biased. 

TL;DR: Reddit user u/jolaurence saw CNBLUE perform and is now a ghost left on this world. 

* Left apartment at 7:30.
* Got to the airport around 9 and hit the first MAGLEV train right when
it was about to leave.
* Knew I was at the right place because there were a lot of teen girls
and young adults.
* The moment the train hit the Administration Complex and the doors
opened, everyone ran.
* Went to the Foreigner Ticket Pickup line and waited for an hour.
* Got ticket. [R3 seat 148, so right behind the fanclubs]
* Groups started practicing at 9 am.
* CNBLUE started right as I got my ticket so I ran to the station
platform to watch them practice.
* So many people were recording them.
* Sang You're So Fine and Cinderella.
* They ended and I cried inside.
* Bought a CNBLUE light stick because #trash.
* Camped out at the station towards the exit and chilled forever.
* But had a great view of the groups practicing for the concert.
* Also, I was near all the people taking professional pictures of the rehearsal.
* Because of where I was, I was able to watch the run-through for the concert.
* Watching NCT Dream practice Chewing Gum destroyed me.
* Red Velvet practiced Dumb Dumb 3 times.
* When B1A4 took the stage for practice, so many girls screamed and ran
to the sides to see.
* The picture people were waving towards them while they practiced.
* B1A4 also has a lot of mama fans.
* EXID: so sexy you have no idea
* And then I watched CNBLUE practice again and I died. Again.
* Met some I-fans that live in Korea but they were in a different location.
* Found seat around 5 pm and waited. Again.
* A performance of NCT 127 singing Fire Truck started and girls went nuts.
* Also, lots of soldiers.
* Sat next to people from Germany and Italy.
* Surrounded by CNBLUE fans. Seriously it was wonderful. They are so popular around Asia. 
* The Italy girls LOVED UP10TION and they were doing the fanchants and
everything and the people around us were having proud moments.
* NCT Dream destroyed me, again. 
* Am now a Red Velvet stan after witnessing Dumb Dumb and Ice Cream Cake live. 
* Whenever CNBLUE was mentioned everyone by me screamed. Well, I screamed too. 
* Same with B1A4 and Red Velvet.
* And everyone lost it when NCT Dream came out ON THE HOVERBOARDS. 
* When we saw them setting up Minhyuk's drums, we all sat at the edge of
our seats.
* Yonghwa is so beautiful in person. Pictures do not do him justice. So
basically if I ever meet him in person I will combust.
* The camera hardly showed Jungshin or Minhyuk and I was very angry about it.
* When they ended, I basically died.
* Overall, it was a fun time. First kpop experience in South Korea down. Much more to go. ",6,30
233,2016-9-4,2016,9,4,0,50zale,My first Kpop concert/show experience: MBC Music Show Champion in Manila,rocknrawr,1472916664,"I got into kpop nearly a year ago (1 year anniversary in 2 weeks) and MBC Show Champion in Manila is my first ever experience watching anything kpop related live. This post will be kinda long and I just got home from the concert like 30 mins ago so maybe my grammar is not that good right now. Went to the concert because of BTS, VIXX, AOA, and Gugudan. I do know the other groups but not so familiar with their songs and members

The show started with the 2 MCs Kim Shin-young and Heechul (guest MC) talking with the crowd and talking about that this was Show Champion's 200th anniversary. The first group to perform was Gugudan. They started off with Wonderland, the entire performance was cute. After the performance they started to introduce themselves. The crowd went wild when Mina and God Sejeong introduced themselves. Seeing Mimi introduce herself as the lucky girl was soo girl crush material. After the short talk they performed Dairy and it was a great performance overall, very nice vocals and the atmosphere was great.

Then KNK performed, what surprised me with KNK was their charisma and confidence on stage. It did not seem that they were a rookie group at all so props to them. Both of their performances were cool and made me want to check them out. Then Astro came next and the crowd went absolutely wild hahahahaha. Their stages were energetic af and soo fun so it was a great setlist from them.

Sonamoo was the next performer, honestly I did not know much about Sonamoo but seeing them perform made me a fan. Their visual game is soo f***ing strong I swear and their vocals were also really great. Then M&amp;D were the next performer and the performance was simply wow. Heechul's vocals were amazing and Jungmo's guitar skills were a sight to behold. Their performances were amazing especially Ulsanbawi was amazing plus the japanese like background helped the atmosphere a lot and they also performed Rokkugo and the entire crowd sang along which was great. Heechul also said to expect Super Show 7 sooo, not sure if it is true but I hope they do come to the Philippines.

Then AOA came on and they were goddess on earth. The crowd went wild everytime Seolhyun, Jimin, Choa, or Hyejeong came on the big screen and during their introductions. They performed three songs, Good Luck, Heart Attack, and Like a Cat (OMG I WAS ABLE TO WITNESS LIKE A CAT LIVE!!!! I CAN DIE NOW). Choa's high notes were breathtaking and their entire setlist was amazing. VIXX came after, and as expected their performance was flawless. It was sad that their were missing one member but their performance was perfect. From what I remember they performed Fantasy which was soo epic then I forgot the second song( sorry) then finally Dynamite which was dope. I really hoped they performed Error cause it is my favorite VIXX song but oh well, overall they had one of the strongest performances yet. Then BAP came on, I am not that familiar with BAP but their performance was dope, it felt like a rock concert so it was a really fun performance.  

Finally the finale, BTS!!!!!!!! The entire arena went crazy by the mere mention of BTS. They started with Fire which was soo fun and everybody was soo into it. Then after was Save Me, and I swear they dance soo good. Sorry but forgot the third song and their closer was Dope which I did not expect at all but the entire arena was singing along and it was such an amazing experience.

Overall the entire experience was soo amazing, since it was my first time to experience anything like it I'll remember this concert for a long time. Some interesting stuff, the crowd was mainly composed of female fans, we ( I am a guy) were outnumbered like 10:1 which was crazy and also I came to the concert alone ;( cause none of my friends are interested in kpop. Also inbetween performance they showed clips of artist congratulating Show Champion on their 200th anniversary. Groups that were shown were EXO, BTOB, Beast, Sistar, IOI, EXID, Gfriend, Red Velvet and a lot more which I forgot. What shocked me the most was that IOI had a lot of fans here, the crowd went absolutely crazy when they showed up. This comes from the fact that the Philippines is mainly a boy group centered nation soo. and also Red Velvet was soo gorgeous in the clip during the concert (SOO EXCITED FOR THEIR COMEBACK!!!).

Thanks for reading this and sorry can't provide fancams cause my camera sucked and if there are things I forgot or missed just add them at the comments :) ",30,81

JYP-60 (Mostly Wonder Girls, Miss A and 2PM. Some Got7.)

Cube-27 (4Minute, Beast, Hyuna solo)

Pledis-26 (Mostly After School and Orange Caramel. Some NUEST and Seventeen.)

Big Hit-25 (BTS)

YG-22 (Half from from Big Bang, Winner. Some 2NE1)

Starship-18 (Sistar, Monsta X, Cosmic Girls.)

WM-16 (Mostly B1A4, 4 from OMG) 

DSP-17 (Half Kara, Half Rainbow. 1 from April)

TS-14 (Mostly Secret, some BAP, 3 from Sonamoo)

Top Media-12 (Teen Top, 3 from Up10tion)

Star Empire Entertainment-12 (9Muses)

Dream Tea Entertainment-13 (Girl's Day)


Anything under 10 songs didn't get a playlist. I knew I was SM biased, but not that biased. What companies do most of your songs come from?

*Edit* I went back and added companies that only have songs from one group like Big Hit (BTS), Star Empire (9Muses) and Dream Tea (Girl's Day)

*Edit Edit* In case you were wondering artist breakdown, I added that too.",43,0

I've really been enjoying the weekly releases, even if I'm not a fan of the song, I appreciate that SM has been branching out more!

Some of my favourites so far have been [All Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0S3knWIdrY) and [My Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whQUpGmh66w) (really love this song, gives me some serious 90's dance vibes).

I wasn't a huge fan of [Born to be Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3_DQgYSS2E) (the HyoJoMin hype was too strong and imo the song didn't deliver and the MV is probably dangerous to those with epilepsy).

Post an opinion/view you have regarding kpop and people play devils advocate and reply with counter arguments. 

Nothing is necessarily meant to change your view, but it's healthy to look out things from another view point.

* A song that was mediocre but had an amazing music video (visuals, dancing choreography, a story etc.) and thus made people much more interested in the song or willing to give the song a chance.

* A song that was absolutely amazing but the music video just did not match up with it at all or was too over the top in some way (cheesy, trying to hard etc) and thus kinda of killed the enthusiasm for the song. I'm expecting this kind of case to be more uncommon than the example above.

After the mv teaser a couple hours ago - fans started to piece together what they predict the MV will be about. From what we saw in the MV teaser at least it looks like the girls are trying to kill each other. 

MV teaser clues:

&gt; Yeri putting [screws](http://imgur.com/Hb6ZEML) in the cereal of &gt; [Wendy](http://imgur.com/NT9d1z0) -- note the screws are all the colours of the members barring yeri's purple (foreshadowing that she wins?)

&gt; Wendy setting fire to/pulling [the string off](http://imgur.com/4iHIGkb) &gt; [Seulgi](http://imgur.com/a/2sbsO) 

&gt; Seulgi distracting/cutting the rope with the fridge to get &gt; [Joy](http://imgur.com/a/EUCt7)


Going off of that, looking back at the image teasers of the different coloured hearts and Russian Roulette logos, there are some more clues:

&gt; [Joy's teaser with her name written in YELLOW](http://imgur.com/a/PeXoj) - her [instagram teaser](http://imgur.com/ij0051n) was also surrounded by yellow heart. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Yeri with her name written in PINK](http://imgur.com/TPR2jh8) she's most likely Irene's target.
&gt; 
&gt; [Wendy with her name in PURPLE](http://imgur.com/pHvphM7)

So the full picture looks like:

**Irene &gt; Yeri &gt; Wendy &gt; Seulgi &gt; Joy &gt; Irene** for a Red Velvet Battle Royale

Okay lets do this. So to give a bit of background, ticketing this round was relatively easy. A lot of my friends got Global Package for at least one day so that eased things up a lot. It also gave us some seriously awesome seats. Each night was a vastly different experience and compared to SWC4 the whole feel of this concert was very different. SWC4 felt like... love and euphoria and SWC5 felt like... sensuality and maturity. I've been a bundle of emotion since it started so hopefully writing this will help me solidify memories and to work through my thoughts. 

Global package was pretty fun btw. I had to pretend I didn't actually live here and was excited to go to SUM (as opposed to it just a usual after work stop). Coolest part was the backstage tour. Got to go on the stage and take a picture. Saw all the tape on the stage for the blocking (I distinctly remember one saying Minho WSS). Then we went into the dressing room. It was full of snacks and their clothes. The clothes were covered, but I could see Taemins Sayonara Hitori outfit hanging down and Jonghyun's plaid jacket. Mostly visible were the shoes. Jonghyun had a pair on the outside and there was a staff lady guarding it but she let me run up to the shoes and put my foot next to it for a size comparison. Let me tell you, Jonghyun is a small man. He just is. He is short with a compact body and dainty hands, but damn if he doesnt have a giant head and huge feet. I have a smaller shoe size and I swear his shoes were twice the length of mine. They were big shoes which added to the effect but still. THere were also standees of each member and you bet your ass I took a pic with the Jonghyun standee (would have done with all of them but they were hustling us)

So Friday night I jetted out from work and made it just five minutes after the lightsticks sold out . No biggie, I had brought older ones and had  ordered two through global package anyhow. Met up with friends and discussed our set wish lists for a bit before going in. 

Night One: I had a third floor first row seat. It wasn't an awful seat, pretty central and barely farther back than second floor. Only gripe was the fact that I was on the walkway made it to where I had to be really mindful when I was jumping to keep from dying. This turned out to be an AMAZING seat holy shit.

Night two: Floor seat right along the long part of the stage. I was four seats in so I had a perfectly unobstructed view of everything they did on the main stage. I was also INCREDIBLY visible given the proximity and my very light hair color. I've already seen myself in more than a couple fancams. I caught Taemin and Minho's eyes whenever they were near and even Jonghyun's once or twice (Onew and Key are crowd sweepers, little to no eye contact; Minho and Taemin make eye contact as much as humanly possible and giggle at reactions; Jonghyun is somewhere in between, he stares VERY intensely and even though you know he isn't actually looking at you it feels like he is and it kinda makes you feel like he is seeing everything about you, but when he does make actual eye contact his eyes are always really warm and sweet not nearly so scary). Because I was so close I could only really watch one member at a time, so I pretty much just watched Jonghyun all night except for certain parts where I knew that I would want to watch someone else.

Night three: Toward the right, high in the third floor. Objectively the worse seat but it afforded me a pretty good view of everything that happened to Jinki that night.

The concert started with Runaway (which is like the cue that its about to start, as in Hey love lets run away [to SHINee World]) before moving into the first VCR. Fairytale where there were five sleeping princes that a witch awoke (by sticking a wand in their ears no less) and they eventually captured and I guess got rid of. This was the only truly weird VCR in this concert.

Then it started in earnest. Hitchiking opening and about halfway through the song they just fell into the opening positions for Married to the Music. They continued to move seamlessly through to Why So Serious and then to Juliette where Key had a KILLER dance break. It was so intense and so exhausting just to watch. They were all breathing hard by the time they got to the first ment.

The first night they named the concert. All of their concerts have really silly names. SHINee World 4 was  Kkokkalkon, the concert not to be missed (also the name of a Bugle like chip) but this one was named   Seonyeowa namuKon meaning Fairy and Tree Concert. Taemin named it that because the Shawols were like beautiful fairies and that SHINee were like trees that always stood rooted. It is also a bit of a play on the name of a Korean fairytale about a fairy and a woodcutter as the word for woodcutter is very similar to . The then talked about the new song Prism.This was a bit hard for me to follow as it used a lot of unfamiliar vocabulary but the sciency aspects of prisms and the colors and light refraction inspired Jonghyun when writing it... I think. I'm still a bit shaky on that. But he talked about the science part a lot.

Prism is... it is unreal. It is not the title track which I have no doubt will be complained about in the future album discussion. And while I'm sure the title is going to awesome, I dont understand how its going to be better than Prism. It is so fucking good. SHINee themselves said that they liked it best and they worked really hard in perfecting that stage. The choreography is dizzyingly sexy and fluid but also sharp and breathtaking. As I said in another post Prism is Symptoms wild twin brother. And there is this one part of the dance where they're essentially shaking their butts at us while looking sexily over their shoulders and Jonghyun was staring right where I was sitting the second night. I was fucking dying, choking on air. It was so so stressful. 

Then they went straight into Replay which honestly caused a bit of whiplash. From the insane sexuality of Prism to the feelz of Replay and baby SHINee thoughts... it was like they were using Replay as cold water to dunk us in after the shock of Prism. After that they did Chocolate with delightful body rolls in the choreography and Jonghyun sinfully lifting his shirt while singing about his own ""chocolate"". Asshole. So fucking rude. 

There was a VCR in here of SHINee just chilling and playing around and eventually going on a very well dressed dinner date together. It was really adorable. Key said that when they were designing this concert some people were trying to give them a cosmology and like demon fighting things but he insisted that SHINee didn't need that. That they were just normal guys so all of the designs for the concert (merch and VCRs) reflected that. It is mostly them just chilling and fucking around with each other and being silly. Or hanging out in their dorm (like on the merch and posters).

They then came out on blocks to perform the cutest little dances for Black Hole. The members were really affectionate with each other during this performance and looked very cutely at one another and hugged each other all while climbing all over these blocks.

Then they did Odd Eye. This was just as sexy as usual, however I do side eye the clothes choices for this song. Onew had a bucket hat on, and while he made it look good I giggled a bit at first. Also because Jonghyun and Onew had these very strange pants that were plaid but had a black strip running straight down the butt. I got a really good view of this the second night as I was on the floor behind the outer stage part. Twitter was calling it their thongs. I also laughed quite a bit at these.

Hold You was excellent and was really fun to fanchant to but then came ""Feel Good"".

Holy balls. Feel Good. First night I literally said ""NO THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF FEEL GOOD I FEEL ILL"" out loud. May have even shouted it, can't remember. The bridge (I think this is the right term, part right before the chorus) of this song has the most interesting choreography. It reminded me of something very religious and reverent. Lots of hand motions and raised arms. Then it goes into ""I can make you feeel good"" which has pretty much exactly the choreo you are imagining I guarantee you. It hurts. I especially love the ""ooooooooo"" parts Key does and all the Minho all over the place in this song.

Then another VCR. This was just like them individually doing bits and pieces of older songs but with slightly strange audio. We were only doing the fanchants but it always took us a second to figure out where in the song it was to start. It was a fun one.

Then they came back out for Alive. This choreo is so masculine and hard hitting and just like everything I wanted for it. Theres headbanging and the Minho Key rap is just fucking awesome. They are both so theatrical and got so into it. It was so much fun. For this set they were wearing this loose jacket that had chains on it and could be buttoned up. Jinki had his buttoned to the very top but Jonghyun only had like one maybe two done up.

After this they did Trigger. GUYS THEY HAD GLOWING NIGHTSTICKS WITH LASERS!!!!! They backup dancers were throwing the members around and pretending to beat them up and during the chorus of the song the lights would go out and they would turn on the lasers and shine them around the stage. They danced with the nightsticks and the screen showed the members in a guns crosshairs. It was so fucking cool. After this was Sherlock... but it was more of a Clue+Note remix as they tend to do. And when Jonghyun hit his high note he opened his jacket entirely. He aimed his ""chocolate"" (I feel dirty typing that) right at my part of the audience, mere feet away, and I almost died. My friend said she thought I was going to vibrate out of my skin. He then buttoned it up again real quick, but barely.

They went backstage and Taemin came out with his Goodbye (Korean Sayonara Hitori) shirt on. Black with long black and red fringe hanging off the arms. He only did a small part of the song but you could see how exhausting it was for him. Taemin is kinda scary to watch sometimes. Whereas when Key is hitting his limit he will pull back a bit and conserve energy where he can Taemin will throw absolutely everything he has into the performance. It is almost manic to watch. Like it is beautiful, but in a terrifying way. I worry about his little self sometimes.

As soon as that beautiful stage was done the other four came out and started Ring Ding Dong. I think it was the second night but Jonghyun fucked up the opening line and would later say in a ment ""that's how you know its live"" (no shit we can hear you guys breathing all the time and see the strain on your neck muscles during high notes). Ring Ding Dong was a joy. It was my first time ever seeing it live. I have never shouted DING DING DING or the words FANTASTIC ELASTIC so loudly or enthusiastically in my life. It was great. As soon as they finished it they went straight into Lucifer. Holy shit this song. The energy of it never gets old. And fanchanting to it is so ridiculously fun as you shout the end of each chorus line. Also Loverholic Robotronic. Gotta love that shit. Also Jonghyun's high note this time was again stupidly long. 

After this they had a ment while explaining their shirts. Onew had a zombie tied to a tree holding a glob of tofu saying Whatever. Key had his zombie dog and said ""Go get some my lil freaks"", Jonghyun had a zombie surrounded by pills and vitamins that said ""Inspiration"", Taemin had ""an Angel and demon fighting for control of his soul"" and Minho's said ""Dream as if youll live forever and live as if youll die today"" with a running person."" They all had a lot of say in these shirts apparently and they were all designed with personal things in mind.

While discussing the shirts they traded off coming out in their ballad outfits. They were all silky and flowy and just perfectly tailored. I swear to the old gods and the new that I have never seen a pair of pants fit a man better than these flowy pants fit Choi Minho. Like holy fucking shit. He is just perfectly built. And with that silvery hair he looked like a fairy tale prince come to life. It was wild.

They did Farewell my Love first. They were up on these platforms with this giant sheet behind them that had the Seong Lib art projecting on it. The first night they actually had a bit of mic trouble for Taemin but the second night. Whew baby. It was so painfully gorgeously live. I was so close that I could see each breath, each muscle movement that went into these gorgeous notes. I cried a lot during this song. It is one of my all-time favorites and it was such a glorious stage. Also... spontaenous combustion is clearly a myth as it did not happen to me during this stage.

Then they did Aside. Which is arguably my absolute least favorite SHINee song. But Korean fans go fucking gaga over it. I've never understood it. Then I looked up the lyrics... and on the third night the lone SHINee song that I could never bring myself to like grew on my like a persistent fungus. Goddammit. 

After this was another new song. Invisible (or clear maybe) Umbrella. This song is just so damn sweet and cute. They had the lyrics on the screens with the members and while I can't translate I could understand that they were really sweet (I don't know if that makes sense, I can understand Korean well enough for myself but I have a hard time actually translating it to English). This song is going to be total heartwarming marshmallow of a song.

Then Minho Key and Taem left the stage... leaving Jinki and Jonghyun up there to do Please Don't Go. Jonghyun cried the first night and actually missed some of his harmonies but they other nights he kept it together and it was just gorgeous. Their voices are unreal together, especially with such a simple song. The whole stadium was weepy after this song.

Then was the next VCR. This was essentially the Woof Woof MV. And it was piss your pants hilarious. They are in like the 90's and are being so fucking stupid. Minho and Onew are working out with weights using just one finger or pretending that its really difficult to just do a pushup. Jonghyun and Key are having a dance off and are trying to break dance. I think Key even tried Cossack style dancing. Jonghyun was rolling on the floor at one point in like a yogic Bow pose just rolling... Taemin had these giant glasses and was just being weird and he missed his iconic line  ?/Kangaji joahni?/Do you like puppies? (which is apparently the KShawol equivalent of When does the Narwhal bacon). This video was wonderful and perfect and just so SHINee. So much of their natural weirdness was in it.

Then they continued the silly by coming out in boxing jackets and gloves with wrestling belts on to perform Punch Drunk Love. I got to watch Jonghyun punch himself in the head repeatedly and got a smile from him while he was doing it too lol. The dance itself is rather reminiscent of Girls Girls Girls in its slight femininity. It was just cute and hilarious and just balls of fun. Everyone was having a blast during this. Then they stripped off the fighting gear and went straight into Dream Girl which was killer as usual. God I love Dream Girl. It never stops blowing my mind.

After this was the new song, So Amazing. They ended up going around on carts ON THE THIRD FUCKING FLOOR. WHERE I WAS IN THE FRONT ROW THE FIRST NIGHT. I could have reached out and poked Taemins tiny booty if I had wanted to. They passed within a foot of me waving and smiling and being precious. Jonghyun and Minho passed last and and just after Minho went past I took like a long shuddering breath (I'd not been breathing for a bit at that point) and realized that I could fuckign smell them. They smelled like happy sweaty boy and a citrus scent (the citrus was probs Jonghyun given the cologne is he always going on about is a fruity scent unisex scent). It was really shocking. I may have said something obnoxious out loud. I don't remember. This eventually turned into Colorful which is always fun. SHINee and Shawols love Colorful, its just so damn happy.

Next was another VCR. It was just SHINee running around doing things, mixing music, driving, cooking. Lots of really cute shots. But the song playing was a new song. Very synthy with so much Key, his unique tone suits this kind of music so much. It was mostly instrumental but I can't wait to hear all of it. The line distribution of this album sounds so even. I swear I hear each of the members in all of the new songs almost evenly. I'm so excited.

After this they did View, which probably had the most intense fanchants the first two nights just cause they're so damn easy and low (I find that our girly voices have a hard time with higher fanchants as we get lost in the music, but lower sounds come out a lot better, forever jealous of APINK fanboys for their resonance). After that was Picasso, this song you really need to watch Minho fancams for. His long body just looks so fucking good doing this choreography. Just... uggghh. But I personally love the first bridge Jonghyun sings and does this cool ass snapping choreo. It was great to see that up close.

Ready or Not is such a jam. Omg,so much jumping. And all the Shawols collectively will just point their lightsticks everytime they say GIRRRL as we shout it with them. Its just delightfully fun. They are always shouting JUMP JUMP during this song and I saw Minho point out a girl and gesture ""wtf are you doing JUMP"" to her. Also theres a part of the song where they say STOP and the music stops for a beat. I had Taemin right in front of me night to. Straight up eye contact as he dropped his jacket low on his arms and rolled his chest and wiggled his eyebrows. Such a godawful person I thought I was going to have a full blown heart attack and aneurysm at the same time. WHO DOES THAT TO A PERSON???

Savior is also super cool and I loved seeing this full choreo. And Everybody is just nuts to watch. I liked the second night where I was actually behind them. I could see their faces when they were turned around. I could see Key make an ouch face when Taemin pulled on his jacket when he was on his back and lots of quick smiles and looks when they were turned around. Minho as expect was just so happy and cheerful and never forgot about us behind them.

Then they left. For the first night we (the Shawols) sang Love Like Oxygen (and failed the rap epically), second night we sang Love Sick (which was cute, we still did the lightstick motion for the BANJJAK parts like we do when they are performing), but the third night we sand An Ode To You. I love hearing us sing higher pitched parts. Shawols sound so pretty sometimes. This song sounded haunting and eerie in the stadium as 13,000 girls sang along. After we finish singing they play another VCR of SHINee practicing for the concert and end it with a black screen simply saying ""Thank you and Love you"" which honestly made me cry a lot the second and third nights especially.

After that they came out and did Lucky Star which is always adorable. And then An Encore, which never fails to make me emotional, its just such a pretty song.

THEN THESE MOTHERFUCKERS DID ROMEO AND JULIETTE. I swear to god, I just talked about this to my friends last week. Going through all their old stuff thinking up a set list wish list. I literally said ""God I'd love it if they'd do Romeo and Juliette but hell will freeze before they do that"" AND THEY FUCKING DID IT. I remember shouting NO FUCKING WAY YOU ARE FUCKING KIDDING ME the first night. God I love the shit of that song. I don't even know why but I do.They later said they picked it as the final song because the final line was  /neol saranghae/I love you. Sappy mofo's bless them.

Now for the sad part. The third night, Onew hurt himself. It was in Ready or Not and they regularly fall during the spinning but this time it was not that part, he was just walking and tripped (partially exhaustion I'm sure, 10 hours of jumping and lightsticking had me beat, I cannot fathom how they felt). I didn't see the initial fall but I noticed about a second later as I saw Key crouching next to him. Then suddenly Jinki stood up and hopped on one foot off the stage. I was on the right side of the stadium and had a perfect view backstage. He jumped back and just collapsed onto his hands and knees. Watching him breathing hard with his head hanging and then rolling onto his back as staff surrounded him was absolutely awful. God my chest feels tight and I'm tearing up remembering it.

I have to say I'm immensely impressed with the other four though. It took them about to Onew's next line to notice he wasn't there and they responded like the goddamn professionals they are. Jonghyun and Minho did a lot of filling in Onew's lines in the rest of Ready or Not and later Savior. Seeing the small individiual stages raise up with one empty was heartbreaking. We Shawols tried to keep going for the other four but the concern was palpable. My friend was on the floor that night too and said she could see Minho kept glancing backstage with a worried face. It was just awful.

Then it was time for Everybody. The lights were out but we could still see them situating themselves. I could see them scooting around and talking and gesturing to each other more than usual. Then the lights came on and we realized Jinki had returned. They moved themselves around so that Taemin would just stand up. The fanchants for Everybody were the loudest I have ever ever ever heard. I almost blacked out at one point from screaming so loud. And everytime Jinki had his lines the screams were so loud and constant that we couldn't even really hear him.  They disappeared to prepare for the encore after this. 

They ended up not doing Lucky Star that night. And they sang An Encore. When it was time for the talk Jonghyun pulled the others close towards Onew so he wouldn't have to walk any more than necessary. They all apologized  profusely and we chanted its okay over and over. They then told us they were planning on showing us a snippet of the new title track but instead they just played the song and did little vaguely in sync dances without moving around much. They looked cute and silly and bashful. They then did Romeo and Juliette close to Onew again and that was it. 

All of my friends streamed out and I swear Olympic Park was just an ocean of Shawol tears. The muggles must have been terrified, just so much crying and sobbing girls and holding each other. SHINee World was a goddamn mess. Thankfully my friends and I were able to have a Shawol pizza party last night and talk the whole concert out sensibly while listening to recordings and exchanging fansite goods. Lots of fun to contrast the actual final night of the concert.

Also just randoms in SHINee World: Key is confirmed for Running Man, his drama Drinking Alone is really hilarious, Minho has a really hardcore movie coming out where he gets beat the fuck up, and  I heard from a connection that SHINee is interviewing with GQ Korea this Friday

The census for 2016 did not change much. Still same format. The only noticeable changes are the question about who you are favorite artists is still there which has been updated with new debuts and artists that are missing and how many years you have been listening to K-pop which now has a decade option (*I fit into that bracket now.*)

#MAKE SURE TO FILL IT OUT

Please let us know ASAP if you notice any issues with the survey. Results will be published after the census has been up for awhile. Let's give it a week or two.

Note: If in the favorite artists section the artist you want to put is not there, you can put them under Other which you can fill in the blank.",329,460

And why?",rodsepp,1473343107,"Rooke girl groups meaning post-Red Velvet (Red Velvet, GFriend, Twice, IOI, Blackpink etc...)

I specify male international audiences, because I find that while female fans seem similar inn SK and abroad, ""fanboy culture"" is much rarer abroad, and thus the tastes of male fans might diverge greatly.

Thank you so much.

TL;DR: Which rookie girl group (or more specifically girl group song)  would appeal the most to non-fanboy international audiences?",39,0

[Dongjun set for a new daily drama!] (http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/09/dongjun-set-for-a-new-daily-drama):

&gt; On September 8, his agency, Star Empire, revealed, ""Dongjun is confirmed to appear in a new KBS 1TV daily drama, 'I Still Love You.'""

&gt; In the drama, he plays Yoon Su Ho, someone who was raised in comparison to his successful older brother and sister, but maintains a bright and optimistic personality.  He is warmly humane and never is concerned with money or his future because he did not grow with many hardships.

&gt; The family drama will air in November.

[Dongjun set for new drama 'Happy Hostage'] (http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/09/dongjun-set-for-new-drama-happy-hostage):

&gt; ZE:A's Dongjun is set for a new drama!

&gt; He has been cast as the lead of 'Happy Hostage,' as revealed by his agency, Star Empire, on September 8.  The scenario received the highest honor at the Gyeongsangbuk-do Culture &amp; Content Agency competition in 2014.  Dongjun will be playing Hong Chan, a worker at an errand center.

&gt; In the drama, Hong Chan is unable to go down to their home with his older brother, Hong Gu, who works at a construction site, for the holidays.  After he finishes up his delivery services, he takes the last bus, and the drama centers on the many things and incidents that happen during the ride.  

&gt; The filming will begin this month.  It will be a 12-part web series with each episode running for ten minutes. ",9,17

I'll give two personal examples here:

1) I didn't realize until recently that kpop stars names/stage names usually don't exceed two syllables. I had always thought of Sica (Jessica) and Fany (Tiffany) as cute nicknames, but then when I saw Irene called something like ""I-ree"" I was like uh.. wait... and then it just clicked. I think someone here on k/pop explained it and I just couldn't believe I never realized it before.

2) The box concept. It's so painfully obvious now that I think about it, but I never realized artists were dancing in a box that was made specifically for that music video. Ever since realizing that it's something I notice within seconds of watching, haha.

Anyways, let's all confess to things we never noticed before and felt silly when we finally did.",240,108

767,2016-9-10,2016,9,10,13,521kz6,[Discussion] Kpop Member Hall Of Fame,Tery_,1473482363,"What would a Kpop Hall Of Fame look like? This was a fun thought I had been toying around with over the last few days as I was shamelessly delaying reviewing WJSN's ""Secret,"" as well as reading too much NFL-related material. If we had to construct a Kpop Hall Of Fame or a Mount Rushmore, who would belong in it? Let me first list some points of order regarding my thought process. For starters, this will be a group member HOF, so no soloists. That will unfortunately leave out legends such as BoA, Hyori, etc. whose careers are extensive. Conversely, I'd be looking at the industry as if it stopped existing after today (like a meteor was about to destroy the planet or something). This means it's unlikely to include members from newer groups (Yuju, Mimi, Momo), which is unfair but we're looking at the complete body of work which will naturally favor veterans. Without further ado, here is my suggested list of 12 members (because formatting), presented in alphabetical order.

**CL (2NE1)**

CL is perhaps in many ways a no-brainer for a list of this kind. Upon debut, she separated herself from the crowd of girl group rappers with her fiery energy (pun most definitely intended). Her stage presence is insane and is (was?) the driving force behind 2NE1. She had strong raps throughout her career, and is gifted in the vocals department, too. In Kpop's heyday she made a name for herself as both a rapper and as the iconic fearless leader of one of Kpop's most badass girl groups.

**Erin (9MUSES)**

It's without a doubt that a cornerstone of success for 9MUSES during the 2013 era was Erin's rapping. Her rap breaks displayed all her talents: flow, speed, charisma, etc. ""Wild"" was the best song in all of 2013 and Erin's rap is a top 3 girl group rap of all time. The consistency she showed with 9MUSES is nearly unmatched by any other girl group rapper, and only now do they get a chance with her no longer being active in the industry. She'll always be in the discussion for best girl group rapper of all-time.

**Hani (EXID)**

Hani represents the hope of all groups struggling in the mire. EXID were a relative unknown before her fancam blew up and now her group enjoys success at the top of the girl group ladder. She has a striking appearance that captivated many, but what's most addicting about Hani is her personality - which is unstoppable and perfect for the variety world. Hani's personality and visuals are enchanting, but people forget that she has a wonderfully smooth voice, too. Her conquests in ""Ah Yeah"" and as part of Dasoni are criminally underrated.

**Hara (KARA)**

Visuals play a huge factor in Kpop, whether you like to admit it or not. I wanted at least one member that was renowned for her looks, and KARA's Hara narrowly beats out After School's Nana for the spot. She was the leading lady in a group with stunning visuals from every position, and the term ""ant waist"" literally stemmed from her. Furthermore, her eyes are beautiful and to be honest her dance skills are also a bit underrated (though mostly because KARA's choreography wasn't always super tough to begin with).

**Hyorin (Sistar)**

There are few idols with jack-of-all-trades status, and fewer still whose JOAT status is easily visible through their music. Hyorin is someone that is hard to come across these days. She's a top-tier vocalist whose ability to cover multiple genres is dynamic. Her rapping ability has been presented in both solo material (""One Way Love"") and the variety show world (Unpretty Rapstar). On top of that, she's got a super healthy body (contention for best in Kpop) and the Sistar choreography archive is full of treats - body rolls, anyone?

**Hyoyeon (Girls' Generation)**

As someone who is a terrible dancer, the most I can evaluate an idol as a dancer is through a few ways. The difficulty / intricacy of the choreography and their energy / charisma while performing on stage. In this regard, Hyoyeon kills it. She's always on fire during her moments she gets to shine, and is like the CL of the Kpop dancing world. Girls' Generation are more known for their iconic dance moves rather than difficult choreography, but her activities in special dance units cements her status as one of the best (female) dancers in my eyes.

**Hyuna (4minute)**

I don't think there's an individual that is more explosive than Hyuna. Hyuna has constantly pushed boundaries and whether through solo material or group activities, will always be a force to be reckoned with. She is responsible for being a figurehead of viral efforts: through her own ""Bubble Pop,"" and the work of others (""Gangnam Style""). She's synonymous with 4minute which was both a blessing and a downfall, but will now embark on an even more extensive solo career.

**LE (EXID)**

When looking at an idol's body of work, the words ""complete"" and ""consistent"" are what you want to see. And LE embodies both elements in spades. Her resume is loaded with potent raps from as early as debut to the most recent section of ""L.I.E."" Sure, LE has had glimpses of struggle, but she always seems to return right to form the next time you see her on stage. She always contributes to the music of EXID and represents what all girl group rappers should aspire to be. Confident, powerful, and consistent on the mic.

**Minzy (2NE1)**

Minzy truly epitomizes the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none character. If she was a videogame character she'd be a balanced class for sure. She's got powerful efforts in singing and rapping - her lower register can be mesmerizing while her flighty rapping abilities were seen early on. Of course, Minzy's highlight is definitely her dance skills, which carry that wow factor. Even though she and Hyuna are now on the solo path, they will always be remembered for their group efforts.

**Seolhyun (AOA)**

Appearance-wise, Seolhyun boasts consistency and versatility. She's a dual-threat on both end of the visual spectrum, and has been a top-tier looker since AOA came out with ""Confused"" in fall 2013. Speaking of, outshining Hyejeong, Yuna, and Choa at center is a difficult task but Seolhyun manages to do so. She is the face of AOA who have had a very strong run, and her status as one of the ""it girls"" furthered her (and AOA's) advancement. A silly little controversy won't hold her back any way.

**Suzy (miss A)**

While her group's future is still in the air, Suzy's development from innocent maknae to one of Korea's ""it girls"" can't be overlooked. She's got a pure appearance and carries miss A on her back in terms of publicity. Furthermore, her maturation of her vocals and visuals has been impressive and consistent since day one. She earned the title of ""Nation's First Love"" and through that continued to expand on her acting opportunities. Hopefully she'll be back on the stage soon.

**Taeyeon (Girls' Generation)**

Last but certainly not least, is Taeyeon. Taeyeon is one of the most popular members of one of the most popular (and successful) girl groups out there. From the leadership position, she has put her beautiful voice on display. Taeyeon is deceptively versatile and there are few vocalists who are so balanced that they sound excellent no matter the genre. She flourished along with SNSD, and further cemented her legacy with the releases of ""I"" and ""Why.""

---

What would your HOF list look like? I focused on girl group members only, but here are my 10 picks for a boy group member HOF, with significantly less time spent thinking about them: **G-Dragon** (Big Bang), **Heechul** (Super Junior), **Jo Kwon** (2AM), **Junsu** (JYJ), **Kyuhyun** (Super Junior), **Rap Monster** (BTS), **Sandeul** (B1A4), **Taemin** (SHINee), **T.O.P** (Big Bang), and **Zico** (Block B). I'm curious to see what other people would have for either gender's list.",11,0

- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

**Judges - In their seating order**

&amp;nbsp;  
At this point I haven't seen any solid news other than the Wiki edits done, which themselves should not be taken as confirmation. There was a Nov 23 2016 date with people like Lovelyz, EXID, Twice &amp; ZE:A going to the Philippines that has since been removed. 
  
Here are the currently listed places along with the alleged performers:

Translation for Hani's post:


I was really happy receiving a lot of love from two oppas. I hope that ""Weekly Idol"" will be able to return to its original position and that everyone can continue to send love [to the show] for a long time. 


Thank you to everyone who brought good memories for me :)

Translation for Heechul's post:


Hyungdon is finally returning  so as promised we will go back to our original positions  ""Weekly Idol"" Hyungdon is back and the two ledgends are back  


Throughout ""Weekly Idol"" I have met so many idols, this feeling is incredible.  theres not many programs idols can actively participate in nowadays, which makes ""Weekly Idol"" even more impressive because the fans love watching the idols bicker/ playing around more than anything (I was once the president of children, wow.. time flies) weekly idol is that much more of an important program to the idols as well as the fans 


Long time ago shows like X-Man , Sponge, Happy Time Baby Face Club, Love Letter, Six Heroines, Star Golden Bell, etc there's actually a lot haha, these shows are old 


Hyungdon ah, in the future please always be happy and stay healthy. 


Bye for now!! It was a great experience

Personally, I gravitate towards the **tough/badass concept**. Examples: [Big Bang's MADE](http://bigbangupdates.com/2015/05/made-series-m-photos-from-naver-music.html), [2NE1's Ugly](https://letsgo2ne1.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/photos-2ne1-ugly-photos-official/), [4minute's Crazy](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/01/4minute-have-fans-going-crazy-with-teaser-images-for-their-new-title-track), just to name a few.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, I like **subtle sexy with aesthetic**. Examples: the pin-up girl style of [Mamamoo's Melting](https://kbeautynow.com/2016/02/22/mamamoo-melting-feb2016/), [HyunA's summer style](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/07/hyuna-is-awesome-in-teaser-images-for-her-hot-comeback), and [Taeyeon chilling in the 90's](https://koreaworldentertainment.wordpress.com/2016/06/28/taeyeon-why-concept-images-music-video/).",117,72

1092,2016-9-15,2016,9,15,0,52r02j,[FANACC] DEANTRBL'S FANSIGN,NoSchittSherlockSEA,1473866617,"So I'm back from DEAN's autograph session and just thought I should share a brief experience.  Here goes: 

So we had this autograph session for DEAN to whoever bought a copy of his album. Now fansigns are a rare thing in my country. A fansign which is free so long as you have an album is as rare as EXIT:X. So I bought a copy early and waited a week for his arrival to where I live.

**THE DAY**

The area was held in the atrium of a small shopping mall. The stage was in front, with a barrier blocking our way to the area where only people with albums can be in. Behind the stage was an escalator (note, important) and basically people from the 2nd to 4th floor all got decent views of the stage so long as you look out. 

I went there early only to be dismayed to be one of only 4 guys out of 60 something people that arrived. Making a mental note to bring a friend next time, i sat waiting and gradually the place starts getting packed... REALLY PACKED.

An hour before the fansign starts, they start letting people with albums into the area at the front. Thing was, there was only a small opening, said opening being obstructed by two people checking your album's origin (must be bought from XXXXX). Within moments it had transformed into the scene from *Battle of the Bastards* where Jon Snow nearly suffocates to death being pushed all around by wildlings and corpses. Cheerful stuff.

After a long while, I gained entrance and had a decent view of the stage. Suddenly the PA system plays *21* and the whole crowd screams. Turns out it was a sound check, and he hadn't arrived yet. They eventually play the entire album, and I must say: having the ENTIRE ATRIUM singing 'I will do you tonight, Private special do it stage' is something to always remember. All of a sudden people on the second floor turn to their right with their phones near the escalator. Dean had arrived *cues screaming*.

First impressions: goddamn, photos REALLY don't do him justice. He looks incredible, in a striped red-and-white jacket, and descended the escalator like it was the stairway to heaven. After changing into his standard beige jacket and SnapBack, he performed *Put my hands on you* (eh), *21* (YES), *I'm not sorry* (EVERYONE WENT NUTS, It was lit) and *Half Moon*. His voice sounds exactly the same as the album; normally singers will have a little bit of processing on their voices that made the live versions sound different, but holy crap DEAN delivered: he was pitch-perfect and hyped the crowd like it was nothing. Contrary to belief, despite having several fully English songs, he still has a translator on hand during a simple back and forth with the MC. 

After the performances was the autograph session. I heard there was supposed to be a QnA from the audience but I suspect due to another event overseas he cancelled it, simply because *Somebody asked DEAN whether it was true He's going to YG*. So we lined up, and I was prepared to ask him who he liked better, Kendrick or Kanye (since both were mentioned in his album), but the guards tore the post it and disallowed questions. By then we were all a little annoyed, but in the spirit of the Heath Ledger's Joker, it was alright, they came prepared. I had sketched a full body portrait of DEAN a week back, and was planning to get him to sign it as a keepsake.

After 10 minutes, it was my turn. I said, 'HI DEAN'. He took one look at the sketch, and his face lit up, 'OH! Is that me?' in his distinctive voice and distinctive accent, and looked really happy as he signed my album. As I was about to ask him to sign the drawing, a guard intervened and said albums only. In a moment of 'screw it', I offered DEAN the drawing, along with the entire clairefontaine  notebook I drew it in. Surprised, he thanked me and gave me a high-five, which actually lasted several seconds as a guard started talking to him on his right, his hand still stuck on mine for a good 4 seconds before I was ushered away. Still in disbelief and in euphoria, I walked away, waving one more time for good measure.

So Yeah! That's about everything! If you have the chance to meet DEAN and see him perform, 10/10 would recommend. His voice is great, knows how to entertain the crowd, and he looks better in person. A happy Rebel signing off ~",16,67

1097,2016-9-15,2016,9,15,1,52rdee,[Discussion] What idol from rookie groups do you think could have a good solo career?,Babyofakangaroo,1473871030,"Which idols from rookie groups do you see havin a solo career in the future? Mostly wanting to know about groups that debuted 2014 and later. There are a lot of older idols who deserve solos but I'm more wondering which newer artists have the potential to go solo. 

Seunghee - Oh My Girl 
Her voice is so good and I can totally see her being an IU type. Would love to see her and Hyojung as solo artists. 

Shownu - Monsta X 
I think he seems perfect for a solo career. His vocals are great and his dancing is even better. I think starship needs to keep pushing him to the forefront of the group because his potential is insane! 

Exy - WJSN 
She has a lot of skill and I think would do well in the solo female rap department in a few years.

Sejeong - IOI/Gugudan 
This one will definitely happen in my opinion. She really made the public fall in love with her and I see her being extremely successful on her own. 

Nayeon - Twice
Twice for some reason doesn't give me vibes of going solo but if anyone of them were to do well at it I think it would be her. 

NCT - Taeyong 
The moment I saw him I knew he was a star. He has a certain magnetic quality that I feel will translate perfectly to a solo career. It will be a while for this one but I think SM will eventually do it


Would love to hear others choices for solo careers! ",227,117

That time Yoseob sung [Another Orion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d_bGmX_dig), oh man this guy can sing, I always love his ballads and this one is just such a simple and sweet one. He knocked it out of the park.

Also thank you Music Bank in Mexico for giving us Exo's [Sabor a Mi]; Yoseob, Youngjae and Sunggyu's [Corre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-QGu84pSZ8&amp;index=15); and Ailee's [Donde Voy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98KleIhP2M).

And how could I forget that time Hanbyul covered [Formidable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcnTXMXuIFM). I don't think there's any other kpop performances in French, is there?

As for English, I thought both Pentagon teams did a good job with [Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q6e2YL_odU) and [See You Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFbfWTpFrg0), although I think most of the meaning of the second song was lost in the performance.

Celebrity worship is everywhere, and it's kinda sneaky. I have never been to SK, but I feel as though it is worse over there. I see articles in the US and think ""why the hell is this news"" (see any multitude of news outlets for examples. I saw one yesterday about 2 actresses that MAY have gotten similar tattoos only because they posted a picture from a tattoo parlor and one had a bandage on. that was the whole article). I see some articles posted here about kpop idols and actresses and I think the same thing. Why is it a big deal if so and so ate a chocolate cake on Tuesday? 

I also see a difference in the responses from these articles. In the US, most of them are ""ugh, these people are not famous. Stop writing about them"" or ""who cares about her f****** shoes. Get a life"", etc. On Korean articles, I see more bashing of the artist/actress/idol/whatever choices than the fact that there was an article written about them. I find it very interesting, but I am not in SK, nor have I ever been, so all of what I see comes from /r/kpop and other news sites. I was also under the impression that the object an idol promotes is REALLY important. I read about one kdrama (I don't watch) that said whatever the female lead wore on the show was sold out within days. I don't see much of that happening in the US (I think Kylie Lip Kits would be a good example of this, but I don't think people buy them because they LIKE Kylie Jenner, but because of the makeup product itself. The ""Rachel"" haircut may also be a good example of this, too. There was a point in the 90s when everyone got the Jennifer Aniston haircut from her time on Friends. Was it because of Jen herself or because they liked the cut? I am leaning more toward the haircut...). Correct me if I am wrong, but I cant recall a time when something was sold out merely because it was an A-lister wearing it. maybe I am blind to these things?

So, those of you that have lived in or visited both, is celebrity worship worse in the US or in SK?

Edit: I just wanted to be clear: I am in no way bashing either country's methods. I think celebrity worship is silly, no matter the form or location. I am also not Korean, not have I ever lived there, so I don't know what day-to-day advertisement and news is like. All I know is what I see as a resident of the US compared to the internet news of SK.

1214,2016-9-17,2016,9,17,16,536cqy,[Discussion] What songs would you put on a legendary kpop playlist?,fathousecats,1474098295,"Hi everyone! I would post this to /r/kpophelp but there aren't nearly as many people over there, so I figured it would be cool to discuss this here instead. I hope this hasn't been done too many times or so? (Also if this post is breaking the rules I totally get if this is removed.)

Anyways, basically what the title says. I want to put together a playlist of *the* most legendary and essential kpop songs, songs that changed kpop, shaped kpop, and basically blew everyone's minds. I want to make a playlist that could be shown to someone not familiar with kpop at all, or someone you're trying to convert, or just a new kpop fan! 

I'd like to limit it to one song per artist (otherwise there'd be a flood of songs!), and these are what I have so far:

* TVXQ - Mirotic
* Wonder Girls - Nobody
* Big Bang - Lies
* KARA - Step
* Super Junior - Sorry Sorry 
* SNSD - Gee
* Infinite - The Chaser
* 2NE1 - I Am The Best
* SHINee - Lucifer

If there is a group that I've already listed that has a song but you feel like another song would be even better, feel free to tell me! I haven't been into kpop for very long, so I'd appreciate if y'all could chime in with your suggestions and help this list grow! :)",61,65

I've tried to debate before that official uploads will be uploaded minutes after the performance, and why couldn't submissions just be of official link? If this goes on, the entire subreddit's TOP page will just be tagged with flair (Video Removed). As much as it's a fucking race for Karma points for that user, I don't even give a shit about what him/her feels. But I particularly don't wish to see my favourite group landed on the top page of /r/kpop with a flair labelled as (video removed) when clearly, there's official upload readily available on Youtube and now lately, even on NAVER.

The chorus came up and I was singing along before realising it wasn't even a Western song! My co worker thought I was crazy when I told her what it was. 
We've also had 'Gangnam Style' by PSY and once even had 'Haru Haru' by BIGBANG. I'm beginning to question whether possibly someone in HQ is also a KPop fan... 
Does anyone else share a similar pleasant surprise? I was, and still am, beyond excited that such a new and foreign song has worked it's way onto Woolies Radio music ",104,124

1253,2016-9-18,2016,9,18,11,53afze,[META] Missing MV discussion threads; possible solutions,creezle,1474166678,"About a week ago [I sent a message to the mods](http://i.imgur.com/zCEVfIQ.png) asking them to look into two MV discussion threads I couldn't find, Dal Shabet's Someone Like U and iKon's What's Wrong?.  

I didn't get a response within 24 hours, and still none to this date, so I asked on /r/kpophelp about it. They said that if a user deletes the post, the thread no longer shows up in search results. However, sometimes comments of a the thread get saved, if you have the link to the original thread.

I understand there are submission changes taking place soon. I also know that there is a music video filter for the sub, so if some compsci wiz could write a script or a kind soul would take time maybe once a week to take all the MV discussion threads and keep the LINK in a text document that would be great. I like revisiting them every now and then. 

Any other ideas? I guess a way it could work is everyone copies the links of threads they like so everyone has a bit of everything to share. If my understanding of how this works is wrong please let me know. This might also be a good idea for album discussion and debut stages.

Then I found the Kpop and eventually the Korean skincare routine, which greatly improved my complexion.

Negative: Also during middle school when I tried to lose weight I thought following a Kpop diet would be a good idea. I went from the nine muses 3 cup diet to the SNSD diet to the eating once a day plan. I thankfully realized how harmfully they were to my growth and stopped doing that dumb shit.

So rkpop what are your unexpected side effects?",166,191

I'd like to highlight [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/41qy36/doing_a_masters_dissertationthesis_on_kpop_and/cz4xall) by u/kpophistorian for getting me going on this path - even if I didn't go about it quite the way they described.",48,266

But imagine you loooove the Teletubbies, and that you have an interview for a job that you desperately need.

When the interviewer asks (as a warm up question) what your favorite show is, are you going to be honest and say Teletubbies?

No, you will lie and say that it's Game of Thrones...

I've noticed a lot of the new girl group members now are younger than me by a few years.

If I'm lucky, the leader, i.e. the eldest, is the same age as me, or a year younger than me.

Is it ""creepy"" that I enjoy watching live performances of these 'younger' girls dancing and singing?

What is the threshold? At what age does it become ""creepy""? 20 (if so, I already passed it)? 25? 30?

Please be honest and pretend you are an average person who has no interest in K-pop.

Every day both her snapchat and Instagram stories are several minutes long, and each are actually different. Even if it's fairly mundane, day-to-day activities, she shares everything with fans.

1752,2016-9-25,2016,9,25,19,54ejme,"I watched Music Bank live, and received a great fan service from WJSN (Cosmic Girls)!!!",Kronoxic,1474798041,"   On Friday September 2nd I was able to watch Music Bank live in the studio during my trip to Korea, organized by King Sejong Institute for korean language learners. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos inside. But I think the prohibition is good, because if I was busy taking photos, I couldn't catch a contact with WJSN :) Ok, let's start from the begining. Everyone before entrance recived a ticket with seating. I didn't know that you have your seating write down on ticket, so hhe first thing after entrance to the Music Bank I've done is sat on the left side next to the MC. First idol which I saw was Solbin from Laboum. Once I settled in, it turned out that I need to change my seat. My new seat was in the second row next to exit to stage. I was able to see every artist from really close distance. We were early and there was rehearsal before live program. During rehearsal I saw IOI, Laboum, Spica and some boysbands. I thought WJSN performance was pre-recorded and will not be able to see them live, because I saw WJSN stage fast winded on PD screen. Luckily I found out that they are goind to perform live, so I prepared a banner with their name. Before going to Music Bank I knew that I will see WJSN, but I wasn't prepared to seating that closed to stage. A few minutes before the live, about 2 meters away from me Solbin was walking.  Of course I had had to call out her. I shouted ' ~' and she waved to me. 

We went live and following the group were performing: RUI, Badkiz, 24k, Flashe, NCT Dream, Lou.de, Bolbbalgan4, MASC, UP10TION, HALO. 

Now it's time to WJSN stage. You know before each performance the artists lined up next to me seating so I had a very good view and I was clearly visible. When I saw WJSN approaching I started to holding my banner. First member, which noticed me was Cheng Xiao, she is my bias from WJSN! She waved to me and I waved her. Later Xuan YI, Yeoreum, Bona, Dayoung. It took a while. Later it was their performance and do not remember anything from it. But I screamed really loud and it was recorded and you can hear it in ending of the the stage. 

Then there were stages of NU'EST, Han Dong Geun, IOI (good^good^good performance), Spica, Laboum, Homme. During the performance of Homme all the artists were preparing to enter the stage for the ending. Fortunately, this time too, WJSN was wating near me! Now, theay were more relaxed, especially Exy.  Before the their stage she was busy talking to someone from staff.  Therefore she had time to send me hearts made from fingers.  Later I exchanged heart above head with Xuan Yi and Seola. Additionally Eunseo showed me the thumbs up and waved. Generally I had similar contact with every member of WJSN, during the whole performance of Homme.  Such a fanservice I've never experienced in my live.  The day before departure from Korea, I've got autographed albums of WJSN, AOA and April from KBS as a token of their gratitude for my help during recording for a program about trip to Korea with KSI students. Album of WJSN was specifically provided for me. My trip to Korea was more than great.

[link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K6RCOcIyeEpYB3sDoc9tSmUpPSPpIZP8gd-NJFi1w48/edit?usp=sharing)  

I am still working on formatting so if you have any suggestions let me know. I believe I have enabled comments on the actual spreadsheet itself to provide any links I may have missed. I was thinking of splitting the weeks by pages, and then maybe spreadsheets by months. We'll see how it goes. I might go back a few weeks to complete september if I have time.

Also let me know if any links are broken/wrong. If I have enough time I can start to include Album Discussion links as well. Thanks all. Have a great week.

 the comeback will 100% be in october. 

 the promtional single has a number in its title.

 it will be their fifth full length album! 

 they recently finished filming for comeback related things and minho said that fans can anticipate. 

 the concept of the comeback / title track will be crime and war and declaration, the fight against crime (or something similar to that)

Personally, I see these crowdfunding campaigns as cash grabs. Some people love their group so much that you're willing to throw lots of money into anything related to them, when there's no guarantee it even benefits the artist. The label's job is to pay for production expenses or find someone to back them. Crowdfunding just lets them be lazy and creates no guarantee of actually using these funds as they're meant to be. It would make sense for artists that are unsigned, but those under a company should not be rewarding this kind of shady funding.

If you look at both their repertoires, they probably have worked on almost every notable kpop MV in the last several years.

Do you guys notice or care when a particular production company makes a video? For example Digipedi is of course famous for their bright spot colors and innuendos; on the flipside though, it seems like every artsy kpop video is (sometimes incorrectly) credited to them (ex: many of the recent SM videos are sometimes claimed to be by them even though they don't seem to be credited).

Also, do you guys ever notice re-use of props/stages/general aesthetic trends? Hope this isn't a barrage of questions lol I'd just be really interested to hear people's thoughts, since music videos are such a huge part of kpop and its appeal.",8,43

Was watching BEATWIN's ""Your Girl"" and I was like ""Hold on, this mv looks strangely familiar "" only to realize it was the same sets as Cross Gene's ""Amazing"". I then stumbled across linked video and noticed that several artists use the same set quite a bit. I  particularly became quite fond of the alleyway set.

Are there any sets that you especially like and what do you think that these sets being used over and over again? I feel like a mv slightly loses it charm if it's shot in a set that has already been used heaps before.
