Eric Nam: His new song is so catchy. And the English song he performed was hella good. Great performance and definitely balanced the rest of the craziness that went on during the show. 

Davichi: What a pleasant surprise. Not that familiar with their music but they killed it as well. That one OST song was dope. Their voices are so good.

Astro: Didn't know much about them but wow they knocked it out of the park. Their songs were catchy and energetic. They were so happy lol. 

Monsta X: Wow they opened the show with a bang. So damn hyped. They set the tone for the amazing show that was to come. They definitely made me a new fan tonight.

Twice: Ugh my heart. They were all so beautiful and so magical. When Sana was shown on the screen I died a little bit. I never said shy shy shy so loud in my life before. It was awesome to freak out with everyone around me. They also killed that special stage. 

BTS: They destroyed the Staples Center. Their stage presence is ridiculous. Everything was fire. Their dancing was so on point. The fanchants and screaming was loud and proud. Probably the only guy group I knew the songs and lyrics to hah. 

TTS: They took me to heaven. The main reason I decided to go this year. Seeing my ultimate bias Taeyeon was indescribable. Tiffany and Seohyun destroyed as well. PARTY was so much fun I don't care what anyone says XD

I went to KCONLA solo since most of my friends don't share my love of kpop and I absolutely have no regrets. I was screaming and dancing in my chair both nights to my hearts content. I had such a blast and I hope everyone else did too =]",63,108

#**IOI**


So I was walking to South Hall K and this girl yelled ""DOES ANYONE WANT AN IOI AUDIENCE FOR $5?"" and me, who hadn't ever seen an idol in my life, bought it. AHHH I was so excited :) I've only seen a few clips of PD101 and thought Pick Me, Yum Yum, and Crush were total bops!! I only knew about half of the members :(( So we enter, and wait for them! I'm really short, and at the time they didn't have the stage projected or anything, so we stood on the cameraman's (he wasn't there the whole time) platform. The room was not as filled as other fan engagements. JunCurryAhn/Jeungri of BgA was the MC. IOI comes out. I screamed really loud. Pledis stan me cried at Jieqiong's pretty rose gold hair. Pledis stan me cried at Nayoung. Twice stan me cried at Somi. Real me cried because these were the first idols I saw. AAAAAAAAhhHHHHHH.  So they asked what it's like to be in LA and outside of Korea, Somi said they went shopping and she spent more than $200 (lol @ me being broke) and ate In-N-Out. They danced a bit to Pick Me (i think it was pick me) and were asked to do aegyo and everyone started chanting ""YEUNJUNG! YEUNJUNG! YEUNJUNG!"" and she did lol she got flustered!! I think Chungha and Jieqiong tried to speak English. They took a selfie with the crowd. The questions ended and then they did their hi-touch. The hi-touches are REALLY REALLY SHORT and I think it's not worth it unless you get your bias group (or dean. he tried to bypass security rules and hug and interlock fingers with people from what i've heard haha he's so cute awww) I did not get hi-touch for anything. But they were really cute their hands looked really small!!


&amp;nbsp;


#**GFRIEND**


SOMEONE ON TWITTER WAS OFFERING A FREE GFRIEND AUDIENCE PASS SO I CONTACTED THEM, WE MET THE NEXT DAY, AND I. SAW. GFRIEND. the line was p long (not as long as block b tho iirc) I got there like 30 minutes in advance and I was about the middle of the line. We got in and while I was walking in I started fangirling (I'm actually a gfriend stan bless) and a girl named Vanessa walking next to me smiled and said ""are you okay"" and I said ""NO OH MY GOD IM SEEING GFRIEND"". We stayed together during the audience and made friends with eachother due to similarities (both short, love gfriend, and turns out we live really close to eachother lol) We stayed a few feet away from the crowd because the view was better. Also they had screens anyways lmao. She asked me who my bias was and I said Eunha, hers was Yuju. She said she was going to the Dean and Block B fan engagement. I was like, oh I really wanted to go to those but I don't have a pass. They came out and we started screaming. Screamed Eunha's name a few times and Umji a lot. EUNHA IS FUCKING GORGEOUS IN REAL LIFE (AS EXPECTED). UMJI. MY GOD. SHE IS. SO. CUTE. HER WAVING. CUTE. HER HEIGHT. SMALL AND CUTE. AHHH I DIED AT UMJI. SOWON IS REALLY REALLY GORGEOUS IN REAL LIFE. YERIN. SAME AS UMJI SHE IS SO CUTE. SINB OH MY GODDDDDDD SHE IS SO PRETTY AND HER ICONIC HAIR OH MY GOD IT LOOKED SO SOFT AND WAVY I JUST WANTED TO TOUCHHHHH ;_; YUJU IS REALLY TALL AND SKINNY OH MY GOD SHE SHOOKK MEEEEEEE. ALL OF THEM HAD ME AND VANESSA SHOOK. BUT ESPECIALLY UMJI. THEY DID THEIR INTRODUCTION. DIED. SinB recommended one of their songs but I don't remember which one it was. They said they love their LA fans. Yuju and Umji spoke in english and everybody went wild. Honestly they were really cute the whole time. They then started Hi-Touch. OH MY GOD VANESSA AND I SCREAMED UMJI WAS SOOOOOOOO CUTE I SAY THAT EVERY 5 SECONDS BUT SHE REALLY WAS HER WAVE AND HIGH FIVE IS SO CUTE. So I don't really remember much from the questions but it was really fun. So then it ended, and THEN. VANESSA GAVE ME HER BLOCK B AUDIENCE PASS. I WAS LIKE. ARE YOU SERIOUS OH MY GOD. AND SHE SAID YES. CRIED. THANKED HER 20 TIMES. AHHHHHH.


&amp;nbsp;


#**Block B** 


AHHHH. MY GOD. I WENT TO THE LINE RIGHT AFTER GFRIEND ENDED. WAITING IN THE LINE TOOK ABOUT 30-50 MINUTES? the line was reallyyyyy long. AND THEN WE WENT IN. agh. We waited another like 30-45 minutes because they were late. The crowd was REALLY BIG. And I'm really short. Luckily they had the screen up which helped a lot but I just watched from there and the girl in front of me's selfie stick phone. Fans started chanting Block B. Didn't work, lol. And then they came out. THE GUY SAID ""UNFORTUNATELY, PARK KYUNG COULD NOT MAKE IT."" :((((( I WAS LIKE NOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. ALSO I WANTED A KYEUNHA REUNION. Zico's weird undercut mullet was, surprisingly, not that weird in real life. Or maybe it's just me because he's had it for a few months and I'm kind of used to it. Don't know. but HooooOOLYYYYY SHIT. ZICO IS REAL AND HE'S A LEGEND AND I LOVE HIS MUSIC AND HIM. HE LOOKS REALLY HANDSOME IN REAL LIFE. Fuck. P.O looked amazing. He really *does* look like T.O.P in real life. Hoooly shit. Can't get over it. Jaehyo was. GORGEOUS. taeil oh my god awww he's so cute!!! U-Kwon very cute aswell. B-BOMB OH MY FUCKING GOD HE'S SO FUCKING HANDSOME I WAS SHOOK!!!! THEY DID THE ""DO YOU WANNA BE! BLOCK B!"" AND ZICO SPOKE IN ENGLISH. COULDN'T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING OVER THE SCREAMING TBH. THEY THANKED THE FNS FOR BEING THERE AND SID THEY WERE HONORED TO BE THERE AND HUMBLED. THEIR FAN ENGAGEMENT WAS SHORT I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL I WAITED MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR U??? THEN THEY DID THEIR HI-TOUCH. I YELLED ""MY SONS"". TAEIL IS SO SO SO CUTE AND ZICO I'M STILL SHOOK BY HIM. IT ENDED AND THEN I LEFT.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


#~~ RED CARPET ~~

(sorry for the fangirling in advance!) I was walking to South Hall K when I saw this man trying to sell his Red Carpet pass. I asked him how much it was with no hope that I would be able to afford it. But then. My god. He sold it to me for 40 DOLLARS. God bless this man. He couldn't sell it for $100 so he marked it down a LOT. I screamed. A lot. I've only been a hardcore kpop fan since December, BTS and TWICE are some of my favorite groups, and Sunday had the best lineup full of my favorite artists, so for me to get a Red Carpet Pass for 40 dollars, once again, HOLY SHIT. I was NOT expecting to see any of Sunday's artists (besides TWICE) at ALL, and I knew I would eventually see BTS one day, not even this close, and ESPECIALLY not this soon. I was really shocked. And the 40 dollars was all the money I had left in my bag, in my head I was like, holy shit am I lucky. Especially with the free GFriend and Block B audience passes that were given to me.


&amp;nbsp;


So we were waiting in line for about 3 hours. The fans made their own line for Red Carpet (lmao, there was no official line anyways) like 15 minutes before we were ACTUALLY supposed to line up at 2:30 but it wasn't honored so security/managers got pissed and moved the line to South Hall J. I made friends with some really nice girls and we were near the front. And the fans were really good at keeping the line organized (unlike the WHOLE of kcon *rolls eyes*) and helping eachother The fans were like, better organizers than the security guards, lmao, like, a fan was yelling to get in single file or ""they won't let us go"". Everyone telephoned down the line to hold onto eachother so no one cuts. And then at around maybe like, 4? they moved us back in front of South Hall K. Felt so bad for the Monsta X fans that we could see from outside (we could see the boys too! The rumors are true, Hyungwon *DOES* look like a cute version of Pepe The Frog!), Monsta X were more than an hour late to their fan engagement. RIP.


&amp;nbsp;


So around 5 is when they started letting everyone in, me and the group of girls got not the best view but front row of the right side of the red carpet, about like 5-7 meters away. Don't know how we got this view because we were literally in the 3rd row of the line (the line was a snake pattern. not even a long one at best).


&amp;nbsp;


Half of the time it was hard to hear through the terrible speakers. The artists come from the red carpet and walk onto the stage, do some stuff, and then exit from the red carpet. There was a projection of the stage for people on the side to see. This is in order of appearance. Unfortunately Monsta X could not attend the red carpet (really starship, kcon, and they were already late so wtf) Also everything went by like a blur so please forgive me if something is incorrect.


&amp;nbsp;


#**ERIC NAM**


And so it starts. The mc stalled for a REALLY. REALLY long time (he was about to catch these hands, seriously) and then he brought out Eric. Eric wore a red suit and a black shirt under it. He's reallyyyyy handsome. He sang a bit of his song and I was dying. Eric's section was like 15 minutes iirc


&amp;nbsp;


#**ASTRO**


AHHH they were so cute! Sanha grew taller (taller than one of the dark haired kids sorry I forgot which one, I think it was Eunwoo) and his cheekbones became more chiseled lol the boy is growing REALLYYYYY fast. A lot of people were yelling for Rocky and Eunwoo (me too honestly). They explained how they chose their introduction. Eunwoo spoke english and it was very, very, cute. Rocky laughed in a girlish way which made Jinjin laugh as well lol. They talked about it being their first time on a plane and how it feels to be in LA and said that the flight took 12 hours! So they answered a few questions and left, made head hearts and all kinds of hearts on the way out, swear I looked one of them in the eye. They took about 15-20 minutes.


&amp;nbsp;


#**TWICE**


AHHHHHHHHHH I STARTED SCREAMING REALLY LOUDLY. JESUS THEY ARE GORGEOUS. They wore all black. Jihyo looked really healthy (THANK GOD). My heart literally stopped???? They're so gorgeous??? And then they got on stage and did their ""one in a million! annyeonghaseyo, twice imnida!"" I honestly just screamed the whole time??? I really wanted them to noticed me so I waited until it was quiet and then yelled ""MOMO I LOVE YOU"" REALLY loudly and like 2 of the girls around me were like ""OH SHE HEARD THAT"" ""SHE LOOKED OVER HERE"" and I almost cried ahhhhh. This was like the classiest I've seen them look and I was shook. MAKNAE LINE WERE SO CUTE (CHAENG ESPECIALLY) AND TZUYU OF COURSE LOOKED AMAZING (her skin was BEAUTIFUL and TAN I was in looooveee). Dahyun and Jihyo are so short. Dahyun's walk is really cute too like the other girls model walked and Dahyun lunge walks lol. The MC was like ""so did any of you watch Seventeen?"" and everyone was either like ""WHAT? SEVENTEEN (the group)???"", ""yikes"", ""NO IT'S CALLED SIXTEEN"". So they answered some questions, talked about how it feels to be in LA and then left, tried to get Jihyo to notice me by yelling ""JIHYO NEOMU YEPPEO"" but failed :((. Mina and Sana looked great from the back. Their set had a lot of time.


&amp;nbsp;


#**DAVICHI**


So Davichi came out and everyone thought it was TTS at first. Everyone was really confused. I felt really bad for them and cheered them on, they didn't get a lot. The other girl is so short compared to the taller one. They sang a little bit and everyone cheered them on then. They answered some questions and then left, cheered them on again. Their set was around 10-15 minutes.


&amp;nbsp;


#**BTS** **(BEWARE OF CAPS)**


OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. FUCK. I WENT WILD. I SAW J-HOPE COMING OUT AND SCREAMED AS LOUD AS I CAN. THEN THE REST. OH MY GOD. RIP ME. IT WAS LIKE SEEING THE PROPHETS OF GOD. I STARTED SCREAMING FOR JIMIN AND DID THE OF COURSE ICONIC ""JJJJAAAAYYYY HOOOOOOOPPPPEEEEEEE"" HOPING TO GET A REACTION OUT OF HIM. DIDN'T WORK COULDN'T OUTSCREAM OTHER FANS AGH. AND THEN YOONGI LOOKED MY WAY AND I DIED???? Okay so. J-Hope is really cute in real life like seriously I couldn't get over it awwww he was so cute and smiley and stuff ahhhh!! he was so happy the whole time it was just beagle hobi the whole time iirc!! JIMIN. DEAR GOD. HE WAS SO SO SO HANDSOME. AND BEING A JIMIN STAN DIDN'T REALLY HELP. IT WENT BY LIKE A BLUR SO I ONLY REMEMBER LIKE 5 SECONDS OF SEEING HIS FACE BUT DEAR GOD. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO PINCH HIS CHEEKS LIKE A GRANDMA. HIS EYE SMILE. IT IS TRUE HIS EYE SMILE WILL MELT YOU. OHHHHH GODDD HE WAS SO SMALL. IT WAS LIKE SEEING GOD. But the boy needs to eat, he looked small, really concerned for his health especially knowing that he tried to starve himself and Taehyung used to worry about his health also (can't a girl just wish for his cute stomach back). Suga was really calm, cool, and collected. Really does have that natural glow like he does in pictures. Jin looked really cute and his lips looked really plump and glossy and they had me shook and JIN had me shook he IS truly the visual. His body was like. really broad shoulders and then the rest of him is a noodle. Rapmon ahhHHHHHH yes he really does look like a cute egg in real life and he seemed to be less sick or actually not sick at all today!!! JUNGKOOK. LOOKED. SO. GOOD. HE HAD THESE GREY/BLUE CONTACTS IN AND OHHHHH I WAS ABOUT TO PASS OUT ON THE SPOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT JUNGKOOK BUT HE REALLY LOOKED GOOD HE'S REALLY REALLY HANDSOME IN REAL LIFE ESPECIALLY TODAY FOR SOME REASON. TAEHYUNG OH MY GODDDDDDD HE LOOKED THE BEST OUT OF ALL OF THEM HIS MIDDLE PART IS A BLESSING AND IT'S TRUE HE *IS* REALLY CUTE IN REAL LIFE. [HE HELD THE CAMERAMAN'S HAND NOT EVEN JOKING.
](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CoxVgaXUIAA0bUp.jpg)  He didn't do his peanut shaped mouth smile :(( he didn't look that happy on stage. Okay so they went on stage and I couldn't really hear anything over the screaming and shit speakers but Namjoon did the intro in english (I heard that) They all looked pretty tired, cant blame them RIP. They answered questions then left ahhh jimin and hobi looked back and gave love to the fans and i think jungkook too!! tbh they had the longest set and they all looked really grown and mature


&amp;nbsp;


#**TTS**


GODDESSES LIVING GODDESSES MY GODDDDD. TAENG HAD EXTENSIONS IN BLESS THE LORD HER LONG HAIR IS A BLESSING. She's actually really, really, tiny. And cute. Tiffany the birthday girl ahhhhh she was so beautiful!! Seohyun of course the maknae mom she was looking classy as hellll until she started trying to speak english on stage it was very cute lol. So they got on stage and Tiffany led mostly that whole thing and talked about how it's their first time performing as TTS and talked about how her friends and family were gonna be at the concert and her birthday and how it feels to be back home with TTS and how TTS feels about being in LA and we all sang happy birthday to her!!! And then Seohyun tried to thank the LA fans in english it was really cute hahaha, don't remember much of Tae talking though!! AND THEN THEY WENT BACK AND TIFFANY WAS BEING REALLY CUTE AND DID A CUTE WALK!! their set was one of the longer ones too


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


So that. All 3 days of the convention. That. That was the highlight of my year so far. It was really. really. REALLY amazing. And even though I didn't go to any of the concerts, I don't really care because I got closer than those who paid 500+ for the concert, just by paying 40 dollars \_()_/

So, without further ado, here are our picks for July 2016!

---

[Indie] [We Are The Night - BRother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMqUxobOCIM)  
&gt; I could go on and on about how much I love We Are The Night. Every single release by them has surpassed their last and I love everything about their electropop indie style of music. Also, the singer has an incredible and unique voice. - /u/dessidy
  
[Indie] [MEat - Gloomy Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FMU7XOeA7w)  
&gt; I stumbled upon this song while browsing new releases, and found myself putting it on replay. Gloomy Saturday is a chill indie song with a slightly jazzy atmosphere that would fit perfectly at a coffeehouse or inside on a rainy day. - /u/dessidy  
  
[R&amp;B] [Nieah - No Way (ft. Kamo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81YPU5khkAI)  
&gt; Okay, I'm cheating a bit with this one, since it came out late June, but I discovered it late. No Way is a chill R&amp;B song and Nieah's and Kamo's voices go well together - /u/dessidy.  
  
[Synthpop] [Neon Bunny - Room 314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiTAs2XRxD4)  
&gt; Since Stay Gold finally is out, I have to mention Neon Bunny. Several tracks from the album have been released as singles previously, so I decided to go with Room 314. The album as a whole is a masterpiece, so I'd recommend to listen to all of it! Neon Bunny is Korean synthpop at it's best. - /u/dessidy 

[Chill Rock] [Raw By Peppers - Spaceship Out Of Bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbigcy_LCs) (LIVE @ OnStage)

&gt; The rhythmic instrumental and echoing vocals give this song a ""spacey"" vibe. Super cool and just as good (if not better) than the [studio version](https://my.mixtape.moe/osjsrf.mp3). - /u/nokel

[Trap/Cloud Rap] [Futuristic Swaver &amp; Icey Blouie - Dream Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeVj7M-eNog)

&gt; Featuring the best producer credit of all time! Swaver and Blouie are a little tough to get into due to their unique style, but once you get through the ""wtf even is this"" stage you'll be hooked. Like a lot of Swaver/Blouie songs, the instrumental in 'Dream Girl' is great and the rap parts are half-sung like you hear in most cloud rap. - /u/nokel

[Hip Hop] [Don Mills - Meerae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLSefFxpW-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt; The most hype K-Hip Hop song I've heard all year! If you're even semi-interested in hip hop you have to check it out. - /u/nokel

[Electronic] [Cerise - Move Lightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8IfMhNhCng)

&gt; The instrumental gives me Postal Service vibes. Great song for summer nights. - /u/nokel

[Indie Rock] [YELLW - ainos](https://youtu.be/T6gUAQ7wcp0)

&gt; The guitar in this song is really catchy! - /u/nokel 

[Indie Pop] [OOHYO - Youth (Day Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrmyqKRGW-0)  
&gt; I believe a few idols have recommended OOHYO on occasion, and I'm joining them now (even though I'm not an idol...). I can't believe this slipped by me when it first came out. Youth is an amazing song, slightly indie poprock with a relaxed atmosphere. - /u/dessidy
  
[Indie Rock] [The Solutions - Ticket To The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLl8YiSPlFI)  
&gt; The Solutions released a new song this week and it's amazing! I discovered them through Movements and hoped they would release new music soon. With this song they took their music style in a new direction and you can hear how much they've grown musically since both Movements and No Problem! EP from last year. - /u/dessidy
  
[Folk] [ESnote - Summer Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yypt4MxnUE)  
&gt; Another fantastic release from this week! Summer Sweet is, as it's name, a sweet summer song with a folksy indie uplifting atmosphere. - /u/dessidy

91,2016-8-2,2016,8,2,4,4vocsy,"[Discussion] Has anyone noticed the drastic decline in the use of ""oppa"" and ""noona"" in k-pop songs over the past few years?",dongledongs,1470080296,"I was watching TWICE MV's and thinking about the comparisons made between them and SNSD, as well as GFRIEND and SNSD.  I wondered why, as a 20-year-old, these artists didn't make me roll my eyes like Oh! era or Kissing You SNSD did when I was a 15-year-old k-pop greenhorn (I love those songs and SNSD now, don't get me wrong!).  My first thought was, ""Well at least they're not singing oppa~ oppa~ over and over"".  


Then it dawned on me, I can't remember the last cute GG concept that had ""oppa"" centered lyrics.  Of course cutesy concepts still glorify youth and romance and all that good stuff, but it seems the focus has shifted to more the humane aspect of kiddy crushes.  Stuff like thinking you're pretty, but still being unsure of yourself in the world of romance (""Sha Sha Sha"") or reminiscing about your bittersweet high school days a la GFRIEND.  I really haven't seen too many putting oppa on a pedestal songs.  Even one's that do, like AOA's Heart Attack shy away from the overuse of the term ""oppa"". 


The same goes for boy groups: what happened to ""noona-killers"" like TEEN TOP or the oversexualization of underage boys like what happened to Taemin?  Of course, BTS saw a bit of that with Jungkook and Jimin, but I definitely don't think it was as bad as the noona fads SHINee and Teen Top saw.  Cross Gene released ""noona, you're mine"" this year, but it definitely seemed to be geared towards a niche audience.


Of course oppa and noona are common honorifics in korean society, but I really feel as though 2015-2016 have really strayed away from that strange oppa/noona fixation that I found cringey when I got into k-pop in 2011.  I really haven't seen anything along those lines since like late 2014.


Has anyone else noticed this and perhaps pondered why? Was it a trend, popularized by the ideas of rich chaebols in dramas hooking up with older women/students hooking up with headstrong older women?  Did Gangnam Style slowly push korean society to reflect on how poisonous and power-heavy those relationships can be?  Are young men and women just becoming more outspoken and confident in korean pop culture?  Does the international lens on k-pop have any influence on this?  Does PD101/IOI's popularity say otherwise?


This could all be in my head too, but I would love to discuss this with anyone who agrees or disagrees!  I just thought it was an interesting trend.


TL;DR: no one says oppa that much anymore",41,70

He jumps in on all the interviews and is clearly adored by the members. Part of it is that he is the most fluent in English but even in Korean interviews the members look to him for guidance. You can tell that they respect him. G-Dragon is also a good leader but has more of a reserved, hands off approach in interviews. However he is involved is all their songs and has helped the members with their solos so he is clearly supportive. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts.",110,53

184,2016-8-3,2016,8,3,0,4vsvhq,[Discussion] Kpop Nightcore,croftman,1470150230,"Hi everybody! My name's croftman and I've been a casual Kpop fan for about a year now after being a big edm/dubstep fan for a while. So earlier I was listening to All Mine by f(x) and a nightcore version came up on my recommended. For those of you who don't nightcore is a sub-genre of edm where basically music is sped up, it is meant to be sound like an anime character sang it but really it doesn't and I'm not a real anime fan and I still enjoy it. So I was listening to some kpop nightcore and I thought it was fire. So I was wondering what the rest of the Kpop community thought of Kpop Nightcore! 

My recommendations:

Their future may seem dim, but having them break at least one record might be reassuring enough for the girls to continue on rather than ending it so soon. Please donate if you can!",3,55

&gt; *""What if Hyuna stayed with the Wonder Girls?""*

Welcome to a new series I've decided to call ""Wild Kpop."" This post is inspired by the Reckless Speculation posts over on the NFL subreddit, which in turn was inspired by the ""N-if-L"" series by Dave Dameshek. In short, it theorizes how a single decision or event being altered would create a series of domino effects and change the future. Granted, the world of Kpop is more rigid than the world of football (there's no free agency, different contracts, etc.), but it's all for fun speculation and puts my imagination to the test, and that's precisely why I decided to take a crack at it. In today's pilot episode, we explore the status of three girl groups if one member decided to stay with her original group.

We now know that shortly after the group's debut in 2007, dance machine Hyuna would withdraw from the group, citing health concerns as the primary reason. Hyuna would end up being replaced by Yubin, and the former would few years later went to revitalize her career with 4minute. **But what if Hyuna never left?** Say she never had any health issues, therefore erasing any worries from her parents. Well for starters, she obviously stays put, and the Wonder Girls' roster remains *Sunye / Yeeun / Sunmi / Hyuna / Sohee.* Their debut year is pretty average, backed by the support of being under a Big 3 company, but then they hit jackpot and ""Nobody"" becomes a sensation in 2008! Wonder Girls rise as a girl group titan, and something else significant happens: **they don't go off on their American adventure the following year!** Instead, 2009 is spent expanding on their luxuries as a top tier group: appearing on variety shows, shooting CFs, raking in the cash, and going to school. Hyuna is also hard at work preparing for her solo debut. By the way, without an American tour looming over her head, **Sunmi never goes on hiatus to focus on school** - she's doing that already. She and the rest of the Wonder Girls cheer from the sidelines as ""Change"" begins Hyuna's ascension to the very top of the Kpop world.

Meanwhile across the pond in 2009, Cube Entertainment was looking to debut a new girl group 4minute, with hopes they will become the flagship artist of the company. Remember, this was a year in which groups like 2NE1, f(x), and T-ARA would debut and we know the competition would be fierce. **Things are looking good because they recently acquired a talented (and gorgeous) trainee in Yubin.** She would handle rapping responsibilities while Jihyun remains the leader and face of the group. However, without a certain Hyuna in their roster, they don't gain nearly as much media attention prior to debuting. So with their ""Hot Issue"" beginnings, the member lineup is: *Jihyun / Yubin / Gayoon / Jiyoon / Sohyun.* They string together good chart placings, but despite the powerful vocals from Gayoon and equally strong rapping from Yubin, they don't really get their fame kickstarted. Without anyone really capable of being soloist material, Cube tries a Gayoon and Jiyoon subunit but even then, 4minute struggle to break out of contain for many years. That is, until ""Crazy"" and 2015. This addicting dance number jolts them to life and suddenly, this song is everywhere and the group starts gaining traction. Yubin and Jiyoon snag berths on Unpretty Rapstar 2, and the variety offers increase. As 2016 rolls around, they drop ""Hate"" much to their fans' delight. Piggybacking off the high of ""Crazy,"" ""Hate"" does very well (despite the obnoxious horns of the chorus) and **4minute get shiny new contracts** as Cube believes they can keep this momentum rolling, and avoid (more) group drama after Hyunseung's departure from B2ST.

Now let's rewind to the summer of 2010. Wonder Girls are cruising, and JYP wants to capitalize by putting together another girl group. He already had a set of trainees many coined as ""the Chinese Wonder Girls,"" and a few changes later, **miss A debuts with *Fei / Jia / Min / Hyelim / Suzy!*** They prove to be phenomenal in their debut year, sweeping charts, shows, and hearts with ""Bad Girl Good Girl"" and ""Breathe,"" in addition to receiving much interest from China. Outside of Lim being in the group, the next few years pan out like the real world miss A, but in this timeline, **Fei has her solo debut in 2014.** ""Fantasy"" is the first stepping stone into a more rigorous advance into the Chinese market, and comes at a time without any political shenanigans rearing their ugly heads around. Fei's promotions help bridge the gap year between ""I Don't Need A Man"" and ""Hush."" However, as 2016 gets underway, their contracts expire. Jia, knowing that the miss A China ship can set sail, doesn't leave the group and resigns. On the other hand, **Min is the member that parts ways,** going the Minzy route and hoping to get her deserved solo debut with another label. Miss A is now a quartet and holds off any possible comeback, letting the members focus on individual activities (because in any universe, Suzy is still bae and still the Nation's First Love).

If you're curious about the Wonder Girls post-2010, there are a few things of note. Hyuna becomes a superstar with ""Bubble Pop."" It's safe to say that her solo career arcs out the same way. She, Sunmi, and Yeeun drop solo works which dominate the '13-'14 years, receiving plenty of praise. Sunye still leaves the group to raise her beautiful baby daughter, and the group still revamps as a band in the summer of 2015 as a breath of fresh air. **Oh and Sohee is still here,** as she managed to find a healthy balance between idol and actress activities. She's on the keyboard, which puts Yeeun on guitar. So to recap! Wonder Girls *(Yeeun / Sunmi / Hyuna / Sohee)* have enjoyed eight straight years of high-level success and still going strong, 4minute *(Jihyun / Yubin / Gayoon / Jiyoon / Sohyun)* started off slow but things are looking up, and miss A *(Fei / Jia / Hyerim / Suzy)* is the only group of the three to suffer a member loss via contracts. It's a different world out there, but that's the world of Wild Kpop.

346,2016-8-4,2016,8,4,9,4w1sdn,Hyuna -- A case for identity loss,[deleted],1470269913,"Okay so as we all know Hyuna has come out with her new single 'How's This' where she is portrayed as a flashy LA/Miami VIP club goer adorned with shiny clothing and jewelry. Sort of like something you would see in a gaudy puff daddy music video. If we look at Hyuna's catalog of work, in 'Roll Deep', the aesthetic is very heavy on the Tumblr, Seapunk, Streetwear vibe. As can be see how she has multicolored seafoam hair in bright pink and blue, she is wearing a USD print bodysuit in one shot. If we look further back in 'Red', Hyuna is sporting an aesthetic that is very similar to Katy Perry. The sort of sexualized cartoonish style that is very appealing to kids while the song itself is very bouncy and upbeat. 

All of this is great but where I feel like Cube is messing up is they are failing to pick a lane for Hyuna to go into. While she is no longer painfully generic like in 'Bubble Pop', Cube is flirting with ever angle of American pop music and not sticking to anything. For the Tumblr/Seapuk aesthetic crowd, it's likely that with 'Roll Deep' that demographic will forget Hyuna as she moves from 'scene' to 'scene' trying to appeal to as many different crowds as possible thus compromising her popularity and making her forgetful. 

Let's look at another idol for comparison. CL. CL has an undeniable hip-hop image. In 2NE1 she was always the hip hop girl. You wouldn't see CL making a Katy Perry esque song where in the MV she is cuddling with furry animals and wearing rubber body suits. And CL was probably one of the most popular female Kpop idols in the USA.  

My case for Hyuna is this, after her long career of coming out with singles and EP's it's time that she find an image and stick with it instead of dipping her toe into several different sounds and looks. 

edit: Cube shills will downvote this",18,0

Example tweet from [@LionGirlsOffl] (https://twitter.com/LionGirlsOffcl/status/761012842136875008):

&gt; i scammed my way into soompi girlgroupzone and allkpop when will you ever

The ""teaser"" that was [posted yesterday] (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4vwq5t/lion_girls%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%98%A8%EA%B1%B8%EC%8A%A4_breathe_teaser/) (by me as well as AKP and Soompi) was taken down. Why? The scenes from the teaser were taken from [Megan Nicole - Escape MV] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpsbUpZ621o). The ""official MV"" for Breathe was released [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPyuPtYFww) and it's a home video by some white girls with Fire as the song.

The [Instagram account] (https://www.instagram.com/liongirlsoffcl/) which showed the profiles of the supposed members links to the teaser, therefore it is also fake.

Additionally, there is no mention of Lion Girls on Hunus Entertainment's website.

Update - [confirmation] (https://twitter.com/DianaRoque0/status/761031275251499008) from former staff of Hunus Ent. Paula Ponzer:

&gt; Hunus and ToppDogg has nothing to do with that account - it's just totally made up. Those are not Hunus girls.",56,154
361,2016-8-4,2016,8,4,11,4w27pz,Rainbow reached Makestar funding goal within a day,HvDreamer,1470276176,"As you all know, [Rainbow officially launched the crowd funding project for their very first photobook 'Up Close' on August 2, 5:00 pm (KST)](http://www.makestar.co/project/singer_rainbow_photo/).  Their funding goal of $31,097 was met on August 3 at around 3:00 pm (KST).  [I'm pretty sure they did because I made a comment about it around that time](http://i.imgur.com/ysFwRBo.jpg) ***(Edit: added screencap; taken at 16/08/03, 7:27pm PST)***.  While it wasn't as fast as some other projects, it was still nice to see all the support Rainbow is getting for this.  

They also released the list of the first 100 backers:  http://www.makestar.co/project/singer_rainbow_photo/update/4/#tab

^ I was slightly surprised with the list, because 70 percent of it appears to be comprised of international fans.  Thought this was a pretty interesting contrast to [Nine Muses](http://www.makestar.co/project/photo_ninemuses/update/10/#tab).  

In any case, the project is still ongoing.  For those who have yet to back it, the deadline is on September 1 (KST), so there is still plenty of time.  If you live in the US and wonder what is the minimum amount of money needed to back this project, the answer to that is ***70 USD***.  ***$35.20*** for ***set 1*** and ***$34.80*** for the cheapest shipping option ***(international mail)***.  

Here are their current stretch goals:  

&gt; * 100% Limited Edition Rainbow photobook and Rainbow stamp!

&gt; * 130% 100 randomly selected additional signed photobooks!

&gt; * 150% Upgrade to higher quality paper and hardcover!

As of today, the project is at 107.9% ($33,558).  To reach the ***130% stretch goal*** we need ***$6,868.10*** more; a total of ***$40,426.10***.  For the ***150% stretch goal*** we need ***$13,087.50*** more; a total of ***$46,645.50***.  

Please support Rainbow if you have the money to do so!",18,85

Mine would be

YG - Excited about about new girl group but will never eclipse the 2NE1 area in their heart. Disappointed with YG's terrible group management skills. Thinks Big Bang invented K-pop

JYP - Really colorful people, quietly smirking in the background as SM and YG have their legal and internal issues. See's TWICE as the new SNSD. Hoping for a 2PM comeback since it's been forever. Hopes JYP retires from making music because he seems like that uncle who always sings in karaoke but looks really awkward. 

SM- People think SM is a fraternity. Anything successful out of SM is a result of better funding and advertising instead of intense training and years of dedication. Anything EXO related is linked to the devil. Secretly waiting for EXO members to slowly leave one by one so that their bias group can fill the void. Thinks SHINEE is the second coming of jesus. Thinks SNSD invented Kpop.

BIGHIT - Acts like they have been following bighit since day one but in reality only started following the company after BTS. Thinks BTS is second coming of jesus. Thinks BTS made Kpop.

467,2016-8-5,2016,8,5,7,4w75be,"My experience with meeting the KCON LA idols and getting pictures with/of them at LAX! (got a selfie, pictures, videos)",soofunny,1470348879," I wanted to make a post like this since most fan accounts are about KCON such as the convention and the concert. 

So I didn't want to pay for those outrageous hi touch prices for the big artists just for a second of hi fiving, no selfies, and no real long conversations. This was my first time attempting this so it was a bit sketchy for me.

 My friends and I planned to see I.O.I and TWICE since they were our favorite groups! Before the day of pre-registration, I researched the times of the planes that were landing after I had seen pictures of I.O.I departing from ICN. Fast forward to the next day, my friends decided not to go due to conflictions in schedule. Not wanting to have people holding me back, I chose to go solo with an uber and meet up with a couple of experienced idol airport meeters?? 

We waited for about 2 hours at the international exit until I finally saw Somi's head pop out and I yelled, ""There they are!!"". The 15 or so fans that I spotted earlier soon grew to around 30 crowding the exit of the terminal. The rest of the members had arrived and everyone proceeded to follow them outside to their shuttle. During this time, gifts were given (my friend gave Somi a necklace and she wore it on the spot!) and lots of greetings were exchanged (the girls are very friendly!!). I have a video of a few members saying [hi to me (more on my youtube channel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtYA1PC3QEw). They arrived at a stopping point where their 3 or so managers tried to shield the girls from the cameras (it was hard since there were so many of them!). Each and every one of the members would stare into your camera or make cute faces/expressions when you called their name. For the most part, I stood next to the pillar where Chungha was and the rest of the fans were. Chungha talked A LOT with the fans about earrings, Pokemon Go, favorite LA foods, and Texas (she lived there for around 8 years). The whole experience was great, and I consider myself very lucky since it was rare for idols to be standing outside for such a long time. Usually, they sit behind the exit where people can't see them until their shuttle arrives. Even then, the managers rush them quickly before getting mobbed. With this experience, I.O.I seemed fairly safe, and it was just a very casual meeting with their fans for about 20-30 minutes. 

Here are some pictures I took with my DLSR of I.O.I! 

[PICTURES](https://rieanex.wordpress.com/0712716-i-o-i-at-lax/)




 The next day, my friends and I ditched the convention as soon as we registered to get our vouchers. We went to see the remaining I.O.I girls (Sejeong,Mina, and Yeunjung), Astro, and SHINee. I felt experienced this time and gave my friends the rundown of how it worked last time. Unknowingly, when the 2 hours passed after their landing, the I.O.I girls zoomed past through the connecting flight exit and hopped into their shuttle in a matter of seconds. I believed the managers learned their lesson with the previous experience of having to wait outside rather than inside. To cut this short, we sat outside that exit for the rest of the day and saw SHINee and [Astro](https://twitter.com/kiiimdoyeon/status/759266658670313472) upclose for a few seconds to a minute. IT WAS HELL. Fan girls pushed and mobbed you if you were in their direction. 

The next day we were expecting TWICE! We got to the airport and they came out fairly quick! I took some [pictures](https://twitter.com/kiiimdoyeon/status/759482742832705536) here. Sana was very cute and greeted as much people as she can. Nayeon didn't really have any makeup on so she tried to keep it low. The other members were also really happy to see all their international fans and accepted as many gifts as possible. I didn't really have that many pictures of them since, as you know, the managers finally realized that they should hide the idols until the shuttle got there. It was fine with us since we all got hi touches for TWICE to make up for it.

The last day. Not gonna lie, we were kinda salty since the airport experiences kept deteriorating as idols kept moving faster into their shuttles, and fan numbers started increasing. We figured that today, since BTS and MONSTA X were arriving for the last day, the number of fans would be through the roof. With low expectations, we were about to turn the corner down to the escalator when I noticed these cute girls standing by the pillars. I got a little bit closer to see since I didn't have my glasses and I realized.. IT WAS IOI ON THEIR WAY BACK TO ICN! It was funny because their faces when they saw us were like ""... haha oh they found us!"". They were probably very tired and no fans were really surrounding them besides a few recording on their phones. I took this opportunity to politely (and nervously) ask my bias, Kim Doyeon for a selfie! She accepted and [this came out!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CotRoT3UIAA9AQJ.jpg) You might have seen this photo around instagram or twitter in the past few days since it keeps getting reposted. We followed them into the airport and watched them check-in. My friends got selfies with other members like Sohye, Somi, Chaeyeon,etc. I'll post them if I get approval from my friends. With that, it came this [video](https://twitter.com/kiiimdoyeon/status/759802575554093057).. TO EXPLAIN, Chaeyeon was in a rush so she got a selfie with my first friend but didn't realize my next friend was asking for a selfie. She thought it was a video where he just wanted her to say hi which is totally fine! I received a few comments where people called her out on it for being rude and whatnot but I deleted them and clarified.

Luckily for me and my friends, we happened to be at that CVS right then! We had no idea they would be there, we were only there getting toilet paper for our Airbnb across the street lol.

I didn't even notice they were there until I saw the CVS manager taking a picture with Somi. Once they were done, I asked if I could have a picture as well and she said ""Yeah, of course!"" [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/zl7Fl) the picture the CVS manager took of us. Please ignore my plastered on awkward smile, I was visibly shaking and starstruck haha. Anyway, after we took the picture, Somi looked at my shirt and said ""Heyyyy, I like your shirt!"" (Of course I'm wearing my TWICE shirt when I meet IOI ugh) Then the manager said ""Oh, wait, you're totally on his shirt right there \*pointing at Tzuyu\*! You're in that group, right?"" Somi and I kinda just looked at each other awkwardly and giggled so I said, ""Uhhhh, different group. She was almost in this group!"" And she chimed in, ""They're my friends though! Haha."" We chatted for a bit more about KCON and stuff, until she said ""Oh! My members are here too! Doyeon and Chungha!"" At that point, I could feel their manager kinda dragging her away and I didn't want to bother them too much more, so I just told her to enjoy LA and I'd see her at the convention. My brain was already melted from the fanboying, so I went back to my friends and had to explain to them why I was almost crying lol. We got in line to checkout, and my friends made me grab a quick stalker status picture right before they left: [Stalker status pic of Doyeon and Somi, Chungha was off camera still paying for her stuff](http://imgur.com/a/XmUE4)

I've been a huge fan of Somi's since Sixteen, so I was so happy to see that she was every bit as sweet and genuine as I hoped she would be.

Anyway, hope that wasn't too boring, just wanted to share my awesome random idol encounter at KCONLA!",142,610

If done well, do you think a co-ed idol group 1) has a market, and 2) would be successful? I know there have been co-ed groups in the past, but they didn't see the level of success current groups are seeing.

For me, ideally, the group would consist of 8-12 members, evenly split between genders. The main focus would be the group as a whole, but the members would be able to split up and do things with different members, including a boy sub-unit and a girl sub-unit.

Thoughts?

**!! WARNING !!** This is super long!

Sorry that this is so delayed. I wanted to post it since it's been a week now, but I've been busy with work and haven't been able to edit as many photos as I'd like. Photos are mainly previews taken from my twitter, but there are a couple HQ edits in there. Here goes!

---

**2016-07-27 IOI Arrival @ LAX**

Photos: [Somi](http://i.imgur.com/fOJUQZO.jpg), [Yoojung 1](http://i.imgur.com/thwcbev.jpg), [Yoojung 2](http://i.imgur.com/xpNkwrN.png), [Doyeon 1](http://i.imgur.com/63ASf6r.jpg), [Doyeon 2](http://i.imgur.com/7rGuMWB.jpg)

After waiting for a couple of hours, they finally started to come out but then stopped and waited against the railing. I'm not sure what they were waiting for then, but the fans were able to interact with them.

Doyeon was closest to the end of the railing and could see all the fans. She accepted some flowers and letters.

Doyeon is really humble... she notices a lot of little things and pays really close attention to detail. One fan wanted to pass her a letter but was too shy and indecisive about whether to hand it over. Doyeon saw her and was the one who stepped forward to receive it from the fan

Another fan passed her multiple bundles of roses. Doyeon immediately assumed they weren't for her, and asked, ""? (Who do I give it to?)"" She was really shocked and made a happy noise when the fan told her that the flowers were all for her

I could tell that all of the girls seemed amazed that fans would come out to greet them. Somi was interacting a lot with the fans as they waited.

Finally the staff told them to walk towards the building exit, but they did this weird uncoordinated loop around the section and then finally ended up standing next to this pillar because apparently the car wasn't there yet? Idk why they would let the girls walk out and stand in the heat when the car hadn't arrived, but they all stood together with their luggage and the fans stood around them (with a safe distance) and we got to talk with them a lot because of it.

Yoojung is alllllllways doing fanservice. She is SO good and tried to speak and understand the fan's in English and it was really charming. I remember a fan asked her to do bang bang and she immediately did the dance point. When the fan acted starstruck, Yoojung got really embarrassed and squealed to herself. I was taking photos and she would pose for me a lot, so I would put down my camera to mouth to her in Korean - ""thank you,"" and ""cute,"" - and she would cover her face and blush when I said it, and she sent me a lot of hearts.

Nayoung is really funny... her awkwardness is no joke. Nayoung has like four set poses (peace sign, wave, hand under chin, and thumbs up) and she just kept cycling through these poses whenever people called her name. She wasn't ignoring people, but she was just soooo out of her element and it was kind of hilarious. 

Nayoung made a lot of eye contact with me and my camera and she would stare at me for a few seconds before looking away if I didn't say anything, but if I caught her staring and then called her name or said something to her, she would pose right away LOLLLL her smile is so awkward but she lifted her phone up a couple of times to take photos of the fans so I think she was also amazed

Chungha seemed very easy to talk to. I did not talk to her myself, but the way she was standing/leaning against the pillar casually and the way she was not shy to have a conversation with the fans... her entire aura is very warm and welcoming, very casual like you are friends already just catching up. She doesn't have any barrier between idol and fan at all.

Somi talked soo much with fans and also interacted with the members a lot. I think she is also very attentive... we made eye contact a lot and since I'm not that good at speaking, sometimes I'd just burst out into a nervous laugh and she would always smile back as if to reassure me. Since I was taking photos, my arm got really tired and at one point I put down my camera and sighed because it was SOOO heavy and I caught her looking at me quietly and she just smiled and then playfully pouted as if she were sad I stopped taking photos? I felt like I got caught LOL She is really adorable - so, so pretty in person - and so relatable.

Kyulkyung is really beautiful. I think she is the most photogenic member, but she also just makes SO many goofy faces because she is always playing around or talking with someone. She doesn't really have a sense of image and is sooo cute.

Chaeyeon seemed very quiet, but she still smiled for fans if they called to her. I wasn't really on her side, so I'm not sure... I did see her talk with Doyeon throughout. She was wearing a white outfit, and wow... her aura is so incredible. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it really felt like she was glowing and blessing us with her presence.

Doyeon is really sweet T_T... I tried calling her name and she looked at me. I asked her to do a finger heart for me, but se replied in this sad baby voice that she couldn't do it because she had no hands available (since she was still carefully holding the flowers and all the gift bangs and things she had received). I totally understood and didn't mind it. Later, I called her name again and she saw me. She placed some things on top of her suitcase, so she tried posing for me - but at that exact moment, a staff woman walked in front of me and blocked my view of Doyeon T_T

I was really sad, but then I suddenly saw Doyeon moving back and popping her head out in this small gap between Nayoung's, Somi's, and the staff woman's heads, posing cutely with a peace sign.

Before I could take a photo though, the flowers Somi had been holding blocked Doyeon's face again and I just sighed LOL. She was soooo cute though, and had such a big smile.

At one point, Nayoung was standing behind Somi and tapped her on the shoulder. Somi spun around, but Nayoung tried to say it wasn't her... but she was SOO BAD AT LYING LOL she was smiling a little and couldn't keep eye contact (she kept looking around). It was SOOO obvious and cute, and Somi just poked Nayoung in the stomach in retaliation [Video](https://twitter.com/wngusdkglaso/status/760693175153459200)

When they were leaving, I shouted, ""Kyulkyungah, hwaiting!"" and she turned back and said in English, ""YOU TOO!!""

**2016-07-29 IOI Hi-Touch event**

Photo: [Doyeon](http://i.imgur.com/2VBIxzw.png)

I lined up early to try and get a good spot so I could take pictures. My memory is bad and I don't know when I can see IOI again, so I really wanted to take a lot and it paid off.

I hadn't been able to go to the airport to see Sejeong, Mina, and Yeonjung arrive, so it was my first time seeing them. Mina is sooo beautiful. Like ooomg she is sooo cute and her skin looks so smooth and perfect. It feels like she glows and every picture I took of her tugs at my heartstrings. Sejeong seems very tired, but she still was acting bright. Yeonjung was pure energy and I love the contrast of having her stand beside Nayoung&lt;3 I missed seeing Yeonjung and was really happy to see her.

I mainly just took pictures quietly... some of the members like Nayoung, Yeonjung, and Somi would make eye contact with my camera. At one point, Kyulkyung stood in front of me with a lazy peace sign and a neutral expression. I think she was waiting to see if I would notice her? Of course I did, so I took lots of photos of her and a smile started to grow on her face. 

She held the pose for a really long time for me, so I lowered my camera to give her a thumbs up and say thank you and her smile got even bigger and she held it again for longer until finally she put her arm down while looking so pleased and amused with herself.

I didn't know what to say for hi-touch at all... Doyeon is my bias and she was first, so I knew I was screwed lol.

When I got to Doyeon, I just really quietly and pathetically said, ""Iloveyou"" and she smiled SOOO CUTELY, SO TOOTHY AND GENUINE and her eyes lit up before she replied in English, ""I love you too!!"" Isnodneonddodndjdjdn KIM DOYEON SLDFK;LSDKF; I don't care if it's a generic response but I managed to record the audio and I am going to keep it in my heart forever.

MY BRAIN SHORT CIRCUITED FOR SOHYE and then YOOJUNG greeted me in Korean, ""Hi!! We meet again!!"" I know it had only been two days but I am shocked she recognized and remembered me because I was just another face in the crowd T_T these girls!!

When I got to Somi, I just said, ""REALLY, Somi? CVS? C-V-S?!"" And she fake pouted and whined, ""I knoooooOOoOOOooOoooow"" in such a cute baby voice and we laughed because I was just teasing her.

I told Kyulkyung that I loved her but I meant to say my friend loves her (I DO TOO BUT YKNOW) BUT I BLANKED OUT LOL

I told Mina that she is soOoOOOoooOOOo cute and I told Yeonjung that I missed her and love her. I told Nayoung that she was the super pretty in Korean and she softly said, ""Thank you"" in English T_T &lt;3

When I came back down, I had definitely lost my position in the front, so I just went towards the side where Doyeon stood. I wasn't directly in front of her, but I was just watching her since the hi-touch had ended. She saw me and quickly sent me a finger heart T_T I wonder if she did it because she remembers I asked for it at the airport? Or if it was just random... But since I didn't have my camera up, I didn't capture it T_T but I was touched regardless because it felt like Dodaeng remembered me...

Doyeon's hands are reaaaaaaaaaaalllllllyyyyyyy softtttttttttt. She is an angel.

**2016-07-31 IOI Departure**

Their car came and the door opened while some staff climbed out.. we could see Sejeong sitting at the opening looking sooo sleepy, and in the row behind her, Kyulkyung was slouched in her seat. They slowly piled out with their luggage and most of them seemed like the sleepiest babies ever ;; some of them had minimal makeup on (if any), like Chungha and Doyeon. Yoojung was leaning over and resting her face on top of her luggage. I saw Kyulkyung checking herself out in her phone, and Mina too! As expected, vitamin Somi looked as if she had no problems lol she kept making eye contact with me again and smiling at me and posing a lot.

The guards were being playful because of all the fans and cameras there, so they kept posing as if THEY were the celebrities. The girls found it funny though. Somi and Nayoung especially kept laughing and smiling. I actually took some photos of the guards, and when I put my camera down and looked up, Somi was staring at me and caught me again... LOL I froze awkwardly, but she just laughed. 

Kyulkyung had this tiny little Victoria's secret bag, but there was a little green bag sticking out of it. Later, my friend saw her pull it out and offer it to Yeonjung - it was a pack of M&amp;Ms LOL

Yeonjung was sooooo cute and kept posing for me too ;_; she is like a little ray of sunshine and I wanted to pet her and hug her so badly.

Somi was really happy about the fans lol she took out her phone and recorded a video of the fans and then started to record each member too. She went up to Mina and practically shoved up the camera lens up against her lips and then up her nose LOL POOR MINA. Somi was CACKLING.

Finally they went in... I was just walking on the side, not really trying to talk to anyone cause I'm shy lol but then Sejeong dropped the bag of chips a fan gave her, so I picked it up and handed it back to her &gt;__&lt; I said, ""hereyougo!"" And she went, ""thANKYOU!!!"" with her cute scratchy voice and her eyesmile &gt;_&lt;

As they were walking through the line to the check in counter, weaving through the barriers, I told Somi, ""Somi, you did well as the special MC (at KCON the night before)!!!"" And she got embarrassed and stuttered. She said, ""Well, I... I tried my best..."" while looking down and nodding to herself. She is sooo humble and soo cute :( I reassured her again by telling her that she did do her best AND she did really well and she smiled again and said thank you.

Once they were all by the check in counter, I started taking photos again. Somi turned around and stared at me once again LOL so I just slowly raised my camera at her and she began to pose with a peace sign while throwing her arm around and avoiding eye contact to make it seem like she wasn't posing for me (is this tsundere) and she laughed afterwards. 

Doyeon seemed to be taking charge at one of the counters (they split up to check in at multiple counters) because she spent most of her time leaning against the counter and calling certain members when it was their turn to check in *_*

Nayoung also kept staring at me again... Maybe she thinks I am only her fan, and she always notices when I'm not taking photos of her LOL. Yeonjung brought over this tiny bottle of Johnson's baby oil and she, Nayoung, and Sohye were staring at it with really confused expressions but I don't know why LOLLL.

There was a fan who wanted to give Yoojung a gift bag... Yoojung saw her and motioned for her to come forward past the barrier lines to give it. Then she cutely accepted it and posed with the bag so the fan could see, and she read her name off of the bag. Later, Somi tried hanging it off of her ear because Yoojung let her, and she nearly fumbled the bag but she somehow miraculously caught it. My friend and I went, ""Niiiice!"" and ""Good catch!"" and she seemed proud of herself.

Yeonjung and Kyulkyung were soo cute and close. Yeonjung would fix Kyulkyung's hair or they'd just stand really closely and talk, or Yeonjung would stand looking over Kyulkyung's shoulder to look at something on her phone. I think they all miss her too...

I didn't get to say anything to Chaeyeon but I will just reiterate that she is Really Freaking Pretty like SO Pretty Oh MY GOD. She also knows how to dress really well to suit her aura/image? She just seems so soft and like angelic. She was having some issue with something so she had to walk to a different counter alone and on the way she let a fan take a selfie with her even though she was in a rush to get to the staff at the counter.

Eventually, like half of them finished checking in, so they moved off to the side to wait. I decided to take the chance to try to talk with Nayoung... she is really, really tall o_o I'm like 5'5"" at least and she was still at least a couple inches taller than me. I spoke with her a little bit in Korean and she was shocked because of my Korean.

After that, she looked at my camera (which I had down since we were talking face to face pretty closely and I didn't want to be rude). She had made eye contact with my camera multiple times throughout the weekend and she just asked me, ""Did the photos come out okay?"" while gesturing towards my camera. I was surprised that she had actually noticed and remembered, to be honest.. but I told her yes... and then she started posing for me again anyways 

During this time, the other members moved to security but it was still too early since everyone wasn't ready yet. So they moved over to these seats to wait and Nayoung got kind of left behind LOL. I put down my camera to let her go and she smiled and waved and quickly scurried off to the other side.

Finally they were gonna go through security. Doyeon was the first one, I think, so I called, ""Doyeonah~"" when she finished and she turned and looked STRAIGHT AT ME AND SMILED... SO BEAUTY SO BEAUTIFUL WOW I'M SURPRISED I DIDN'T PASS OUT TBH WOWWWW KIM D O Y E O N W O W  I told her to travel home safely and she just said in her soft, cute English, ""Thank you~""

After they went up the stairs, I had the idea to run back to another section so I could see them a little bit longer as they waited in line. They were kinda paired off so I couldn't see Doyeon, but Yoojung and Somi at the end were sooo cute. 

At one point, they tried making a heart with their arms but the shape was more like a triangle? So I shouted, ""What kind of shape is that???""

Somi heard me, so then they tried to make it seem like more of a heart but their height difference made it so difficult, so I shouted, ""I think it's a bit uneven!"" MY friend said, ""Somi, go down more!"" While I shouted ""Somi, make yourself shorter!!""

Somi was soo cute haha she like playfully rolled her eyes and did this like *forced smile* expression, but she still made herself really short while Yoojung stood on her tippy toes. Afterwards, Somi laughed... she tries to act so tough lmao but she does soo much fanservice.

Nayoung saw me and immediately smiled and started cycling through her four standard poses, so I tried to take pics but they are blurry  later I said, ""Nayoungah, one more time?"" And she obeyed really obediently but I still couldn't take it well because of the distance LOL  the person beside me was like, ""I think Nayoung only hears your voice. How does she listen so well to you?!""

After a bit, we couldn't see them anymore I'm really grateful I got to see them a lot in a short amount of time. My friends got AMAZING memories with other members too, especially Chungha who is an actual angel on Earth. They're all sweet girls  Thank you for coming to LA! IOI fighting

I suppose, the question up for discussion, because I was not an EXO-L at the time the mass M exodus went down, is this: what the heck did SM do to EXO-M?

I mean, this was a group with SO much potential and promise! The music was actually pretty tight, as a full 12 member unit, the coregraphy was INCREDIBLY tight (although no one in SM can seem to beat SHINee at core, not even my beloved TVXQ) and I actually thought the songs worked better in Chinese than they did in Korean.

But here we are, a few years (and three biases later), and EXO-M is dead.

713,2016-8-7,2016,8,7,14,4wjo8v,Which music show recordings best showcase your favorite idol/group? [Discussion],buffystan,1470548908,"I think we can all agree that the camera-men and editing team are generally out of their mind with so many jump cuts, slant angles, close-ups (often on the 'visual' members) during dance breaks, etc. I find it rare discovering recordings that properly showcase the dancing, in particular. I just wanna see those dope dance breaks, dog gammit! 



Although I'm just beginning to take tabs on this, my first finding was [this performance of Pretty U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX__yzzLGCw). Although there are some close-ups that I wish were wide shots, I actually think the editing team did a great job. Plus, no blurry, trippy transitions - everything is pretty clean. And I think certain medium shots that cut off the full group and choreography are generally appropriate. We get to see much of the chorus in a wide shot, which makes me happy.



Have you found any recordings with high quality camera work and editing, showcasing the group and choreography clearly?",17,59

I think Key's dance style really fits the sharp choreography of [Your Number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq3NB3U0Ps8). Key's stage presence is also incredible in the Odd Eye [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQbtuQ2-2WQ) [stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPp9da0-Q_E).

Taemin goes full-out in his dancing during [Picasso at Tokyo Dome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BczEPkOmMvs), especially at [this part](https://youtu.be/BczEPkOmMvs?t=3m29s).

Acts such as 2NE1, Kara, Big Bang, SHINee, SNSD, Secret, MBLAQ, 2PM After School, etc. were considered to be at their prime.  I'm trying to figure out just what made that era so special and unique to so many fans.


So what is, in your opinion, the best song or songs that really define that era?  Do you agree that this was in fact k-pop's best time?  What has changed in that time, for better or for worse?  Can you compare certain artists and how they've fared (4Minute as opposed to SHINee maybe), and why they did better or worse in that point in time?",54,60

Beware: long!  
**Skip this part if youre only interested in the concert**  
  
I was fortunate enough to have planned my trip to Tokyo at the same time as Seventeen had their concert, so I made sure to get a ticket!  
  
I arrived at the venue about two hours before the start at the concert, one hour before doors. I was a bit worried Id get lost on my way there, but as soon as I got off the metro I knew exactly where to go. So many fans! And they had a truck circling the block and playing VERY NICE while advertising the repackage. After taking a quick picture of the bus, I went straight to the merch stands. Most things were sold out (no lightstick, nooooo!), but I ended up buying a t-shirt and a Woozi fan.   
  
As I was sitting waiting outside the venue, I noticed quite a lot of people eyeing me. As a non-Asian Carat, I definitely stood out. After a while a girl came up and handed me a business card for their Seventeen dance cover group. Then the two girls next to me asked if they could take a picture with me I just said okay, and then asked if I could take a picture with them as well. Overall, everyone was really polite.  
  
Finally the security started lining people up and letting them in. At this point I got really nervous. As tickets sold out immediately, I had to buy a fan club ticket second hand. So my ticket had another name on it and Im not even a member of the Japanese fan club I was almost shaking when I handed the girl at the entrance my ticket. She looked at it and me really suspiciously, but then let me past. She probably figured I had bought it second hand, I was so nervous she wouldnt let me past!  
  
At the venue, I had a seat on the back of the second floor. So not that close to the stage, but excellent for clearly seeing the choreographies! The inclination was really good too, so I had a completely clear view of the stage and all screens.  
  
**Concert starts here!**  
  
After playing music videos for a while (fanchanting to VERY NICE on point!), the videos were turned off and the lights were lowered. When it was completely dark aside from light sticks, a video introducing the members began. Everyone looked so good! Then the video ended and it got dark again. Then spotlights turned to the back of the stage and they rose up! The first song was Shining Diamond. Everyone immediately slipped into the diamond life, and from there it just continued.   
  
I believe the setlist was the same as the one I found for Osaka, but they might have switched songs around. Im still too hyped to put things in order, and my mind is still jumbled, so Ill put down what I remember most clearly! (please do not use this list as a setlist, Im certain I mixed up the order somehow. And a few songs at the beginning is a bit blank since I was so hyped).  
  
Q&amp;A was played quite early on, with Vernon, S.Coups and Woozi encouraging the audience to sing along during Ailees part. S.Coups was in a great mood and kept playing with and patting Woozis hair at one point. And while not looking too happy, Woozi let him.   
  
After that, a video was played with the Performance team looking awesome. Especially Jun, wow, the rest of the audience loved it too. After the video performance team + Vernon entered and did Jam Jam. Good choreo, and the performance team took opportunity of Vernons parts! He left after that song, while the others continued with OMG and a cover of Zicos I Am You, You Are Me. OMG was really fun, and they did a nice choreo for it. I Am You You Are Me was also really good! It is not too vocally difficult, and they managed great with the rapping as well. I love that song, so it was a big plus for me!  The choreo fitted the performance teams version of the song really well! And Jun got the kiss!  
  
Then it was the vocal teams turn. Another cool intro, then 20 starts. I ended up hugging my Woozi fan during the majority of the time the vocal team was on stage. Hes just so good, and his voice is touching. Especially when they did their cover of Bigbangs If You. I was almost crying. When I grow up was really good too! I dont remember much from this part except Woozis amazingness. I was a bit gone.  
  
Last out was the hiphop team. They had an intro, then they played both Ah Yeah and Fronting. It still feels surreal to have heard the legendary pull up on you wacks with a mac fully loaded-line live. They got the audience to sing along during the Ah Yeahs, which was nice. The last song was so cute, internet tells me its a new song? As I said before, S.Coups was in an excellent mood and started doing fanservice with Vernon. He was backhugging, leaning on his shoulder and touching his hair. At the end they had free choreo, so he grabbed onto Vernon and danced something that reminded me of tango. Meanwhile Meanie looked extremely awkward. At one point Mingyu laid his head on Wonwoos shoulder, but Wonwoo seemed uncomfortable, and he pulled away. I think the Meanie ship is quite dead. Most of the second half of the song they were just there, did their parts and looked awkwardly at S.Coups and Vernon.  
  
They had some talking at a few points. It was all Japanese/Korean, neither of which I understand, and I dont remember exactly when they had them, so Ill sum them up here. The first talk was mostly an introduction of the members. A few said a couple words in Japanese, which the audience loved. The second talk was divided into two groups, one groups talked while the other changed outfits. The first group talked a bit about Japan (I think). The second group did aegyo. The8 started out strong with cutely saiying aishiteru. Mingyu did it against his will, Hoshi was weird (but still adorable), Jun cute, Wonwoo just said one word in his low voice, and everyone moved on. Dino was last and went the safe way of copying The8.  
  
After the unit performances, all of Seventeen were reunited to do No F.U.N. Wow the choreo was amazing from my angle! I could really see how they used the umbrellas, and Mingyu did another hilarious there-and-not-there appearance. With all of his appearances, they solved it quite well! If the choreo wasnt too demanding, he was there. If it was more demanding, they did it as twelve, and then Mingyu popped up in time for his part. He did a couple walk-bys, and rose up and down from the stage at the back a few times.  
  
At the first tones of Rising Sun I knew It was going to be good, and wow they delivered. As a newer Jaejoong fan (missed all of DB5K), I loved seeing it performed live. And Seventeen really did it well!  
  
Then we had a fanchant treat with Pretty U, Mansae and Very Nice in a row. Japanese fans really know their fanchants! With only one European concert as my live kpop experience, I was blown away. I should have prepared more All I could do was to follow along the parts I knew. I love Pretty Us choreo, and seeing that foot-stomping live was such a treat. Its such a fun choreo. For Mansae, Mingyu appeared just in time for his part, finished that choreo and walked out again. Badass. Poor Hoshi had very visible sweat stains on his jacke. Luckily the jackets were gone for Very Nice. Very Nice was very nice, and fanchanting aju nice! is a lot of fun! And the choreo, ah, those suspenders!  
  
Then the lights turned off, and, nothing. The audience started chanting something Im assuming was one more song or again in Japanese. Finally a video turned on and we got to see Seventeen as agents, handing over a mysterious bag to each other suspiciously. Mingyu was the last person to receive it, he looked in the bag, and then it ended. I wanted to know what it was in the bag!  
  
After the video, Seventeen came out again and did Love Letter, Adore U, and Healing.  Halfway through Adore U I noticed that Woozi looks seriously tired. I can see that Joshua checks that hes okay, and that he then pulls back a bit and dont go all out with the choreo. Luckily that was the last choreo and the next song is sung sitting down. I was a bit focused on Woozi at this point, so I didnt really keep track of the others. He still looked extremely tired, but continued on. He got a bit better after sitting down, I was almost worried hed faint at the end of Adore U. Woozi also got pet-his-head attacked at the end, with S.Coups in the lead and everyone was laughing and seemed to have fun!  
  
They got up again after the song to line up and say a last few words. Japanese/Korean only again, so I mostly kept my eye on Woozi. Jeonghan also seemed to check if he was okay, and he leaned a bit on Jeonghan for a couple seconds. Then he seemed all right again, and finished with a few sweet words.  
  
Last to talk was S.Coups, and when he finished a big birthday cake was rolled in!  I knew it was his birthday and were wondering if something would happen. S.Coups immediately hid his face in his towel, and when Jeonghan finally managed to try it away a bit from his face we could see that hed been crying. So sweet! Everyone was hugging him while he cried. When they finally managed to gather themselves, the rest of the group told the fans to turn on the lightsticks, before singing Happy Birthday (in English). Then they had him blow out the candles by having everyone turn off their light sticks when he blew. At this point I really wished I had a lightstick.   
The other members celebrating by throwing cake at his face, with Jeonghan hitting him with the biggest piece just when everyone else stopped. Then S.Coups was crying/laughing again.  
  
They said goodbye one last time after that, while S.Coups was still wiping cake off his face (and tasting it). He thanked everyone again and looked so touched, then they walked up to the back of the stage, and ascended while waving.  
  
As a final thing before lights tuned on, we were shown the full Love Letter buss edition mv. It was great. Woozi headbanging like crazy, Hoshi using the belt as a microphone, I really hope theyll upload it to youtube after this tour!  
  
Then the concert was over and we left. Being so hyped I got on the wrong metro line, then after getting on the right line, I got off at the wrong side of the station and had to walk around the entire station. I think I was too hyped to function properly.   
  
Overall, the concert was amazing and I loved all of it, even the Jeonghan stans behind me who screamed his name all the time (Id say he has the biggest Japanese fandom, followed by Dino, Hoshi and Vernon, based on noise).   
Im a bit worried how theyll do tomorrow, with two concerts in a row (2pm and 7pm). Especially since its really hot in Tokyo now (itll be 36C tomorrow). I really hope theyll be okay, and that theyll have time for some rest soon too!

That may seem relatively low, however for kpop artists this is amazing. Most K-Pop artists don't even enter this chart. And BlackPink's album is doing amazing as well. It is charted at #2 right now. This group could be known as a huge group that breaks into the American music market while just singing in Korean. They could release English songs as well due to all of them speaking English. I'm telling you now, this group is going to be huge. 

Update: Black Pink's ""BOOMBAYAH"" has moved up to 148 and ""Whistle"" is at 155. I have never seen a kpop group up there for so long and that high...

PS: I Hope that this group will make most americans think better of kpop, as well as the media. They seem to only put k-pop in the media for the use of parody. (Gangnam Style)",35,197

Another bit of important news:

###**Sangmin has dropped out due to health issues**

Article from [Allkpop] (http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/08/boys-24s-sangmin-drops-out-of-ongoing-competition-for-personal-reasons):

&gt; Even though Mnet's 'Boys 24' came to an end this past August 6, the top 24 contestants will be taking their competition to the stage next to determine the most talented and popular members to debut in a new, grand-scale boy group.

&gt; However, it seems that unit Sky's leader Sangmin will not be continuing the competition with the rest of the 23 contestants who survived for the duration of 'Boys 24'. Reportedly, Sangmin decided to drop out due to personal reasons, which included health issues. After discussion, Mnet has decided to respect Sangmin's wishes. 

&gt; To replace Sangmin's spot, Mnet will be carrying out an online vote to bring back not just one, but five contestants who were formerly eliminated on 'Boys 24'. The votes will take place from August 10-15 with the winners of the vote being announced on August 16. 

&gt; The final 28 top contestants will begin their live stage competition this September 22.

The voting will start on August 10th at 11:00 KST on [their website] (http://boys24.mnet.com/)

Who will you vote for?

(Bonus: They just released a [behind-the-scenes video for Rising Star MV] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHoDioR7psU))

(Another bonus: They just created a [channel on V App] (http://www.vlive.tv/channels/EFF1E7))

Update: Voting has now started! 

##[Link to the poll on Korean website] (http://m.mnet.com/event/promotion/194)     
##[Link to the poll on English website] (http://mwave.interest.me/en/star/poll/vote.m?poll_seq=530)

(You can vote in both, once per day - I don't know if the one on the English website actually counts though)

Update:

1108,2016-8-11,2016,8,11,21,4x7qt1,What was your favorite concept on each member in your bias group?,zyx_kjd973,1470918851,"I posted this question on r/exo, but I want to broaden it to all of kpop. For my bias group, here are the concepts I think suited each member best: 

Xiumin - **Call Me Baby or Monster.** While I appreciate Xiumin, he's kind of on the lower end of my bias list. I really liked how he looked in both of those eras. I like that in CMB he got a decent amount of lines and got some front time to show off his dancing skills. The only thing I disliked about him in the CMB era was that god awful blue little league looking outfit. Hes very handsome and has a great body, so I dont understand why the stylists constantly dress him like a 7 year old, but I digress. In Monster, I think Xiumin looked great. He looks absolutely ethereal with the blondish hair and I loved his overall energy performing. Like I said, hes not high on my bias list so there may be a better era/concept for him, but those are the ones I liked him in best.

Suho - **Lucky One.** I love me some Gramps Suho(one of my favorite members) but at first I wasn't a fan of light brown haired Suho. However it grew on me immediately. He sounded *angelic* in the song especially his [""I don't mind](https://youtu.be/YuDTNwyD6t4?t=44s) part. And watching them perform it live, you can see how his dancing has improved and how he no longer makes those derpy faces (which I may kind of miss?). Plus around this time, Savage Suho was fully unleashed and I [love](http://66.media.tumblr.com/12eee04de76f5a285e99f63d3193167d/tumblr_oa03gm4zYf1qbbha7o5_400.gif) [it](http://66.media.tumblr.com/43446eee6ab79f78ca73b4b022640c39/tumblr_oa03gm4zYf1qbbha7o4_400.gif).

Lay - **[Call](http://imgur.com/J5c87mx) [Me](http://imgur.com/wwqtSWr) [Baby](http://imgur.com/VIlVrM2).** [No](http://imgur.com/7al12qO). [Doubt](http://imgur.com/AUW1LPA). [About](http://imgur.com/QOgUxi0). [It](https://imgur.com/tgGx1dE). CMB was the first EXO video I ever saw. I always wondered how people found biases because at this time I didnt have a bias in any group I had listened to. Then Lay winked at me and I just **knew** hed be my bias. Blonde Lay is so gorgeous (CMB blonde, not Wolf blonde *shudders*), and I wish he couldve kept it blonde for a longer period of time. Yixings voice got to really shine and his style of dancing really suited that choreography (I think his dancing was much better than Kais on this concept). One of the many reasons I love the Exodus album is that in the M version he got a lot of lines and he has such a dreamy singing voice. I could go on and on about how \*dreamy*\ Lay is during this era (and in general) but I dont want to make this post any longer than it already is.

Baekhyun - **Monster.** This may considered blasphemous, but I never really cared about Baekhyun. I thought he had a nice voice and was funny, but I was quite indifferent towards him. Then I saw the Monster MV and thats when I realized how much I was missing out on. Oh my gosh, [just wow](http://imgur.com/V3CUF1z). The makeup, piercings, dark hair, etc. really suited him, IMO hes [never looked better](http://imgur.com/a/oyOgM). His voice sounds amazing as usual in this song, but his dancing has just evolved to another level. Im super impressed and he ruined my already super shaky bias list^(damn you Baek abs)

Chen - **Growl and Overdose.** Chen fit that schoolboy vibe they were going for during that era *perfectly.* Like when I think of Growl, [this](http://imgur.com/WPQo1ye) or [this](http://imgur.com/Skfkaam) is the first thing that pops into my head. His vocals are always on point and he usually looks great (except *maybe* the poodle/ramen hair). If Chen was a cute schoolboy during the Growl era, then he evolved into a suave gentleman for the Overdose era. He looks fantastic in a suit, and this was my favorite hairstyle on him, pushed off his forehead like [this](http://imgur.com/8jd1VdR) (please excuse the crappy quality, I couldnt find a gif of this so I attempted to make my own). And his high note in the M version is amazing, Im always in awe of his voice. I was going more for EXO songs and concepts for this post, but in general my favorite Jongdae look is [rocker Jongdae](http://imgur.com/c31mlxq). Please SM give us a rock Chen album^(or a solo album in general)

Chanyeol - He's not really high on my bias list, so there could be another era that fits him better. When I first posted this, I said **Overdose.** It is such a dope song, and his rap imo was fantastic. In most songs the rap is my least favorite part, but I love it in Overdose mainly because of him. And I really like the reddish brown or black hair on him, honestly I like any hair color on him except that bright red he had for the most recent comeback^(dont kill me). But now that I think about it, I don't think he has had *his* era where he has really stood out like the others. We shall see what this next comeback brings however.

Kyungsoo - **Growl.** Not sure how popular this is, but hear me out. I'm even a little perplexed as to why I picked it, but there's something about D.O. during this era that's almost magnetic (can't think of another word). He looks and sounds amazing. I love his part in the song and his ad libs and voice in general kill me every time. Also Kyungsoo [with the red hair and undercut](http://imgur.com/a/tRWs4) may be my favorite hair style of *any* EXO member. Overall though, Im a fan of any concept that shows off Kyungsoos chocolate voice and his hair is pushed back off his forehead.

Kai - **Love Me Right.** One, I love me some [pink haired Jongin](http://imgur.com/XdRhEwa). I usually dislike the less natural colors on the boys, but the for some reason I love the pink on him. Two, his dancing is always amazing but watching him dance to LMR is hypnotic. I loved watching him perform this song because he seemed to really enjoy the choreography. Three, this was the first time I really paid attention to and enjoyed his vocals. Personally, I think this is one of the songs where you can hear how he's developed as a vocalist. And four, gotta love [football player](http://imgur.com/VocX1Uw) [Kai](http://imgur.com/QcCHG8p). 

Sehun - **Monster.** Sehun always looks very handsome, but I think he looks [SOOOO](http://imgur.com/nUyo4xr) [good](http://imgur.com/iQcEO7n). Especially with the black hair in the Monster MV. Also, his rapping has improved a *lot.*  He went from E-X-O to cringey ~~but iconic~~ [English](https://youtu.be/RuqaVryDRd0?t=36s) [lines](https://youtu.be/yWfsla_Uh80?t=3m6s)  to actually getting to split the rap time with Chanyeol. I may be in the minority, but I actually like hearing Sehun rap. I really liked watching him dance to the first chorus. He did that leg move the best (after Kai). At first, I didn't get the hype about him or his dancing because I thought he was kind of lazy after the MAMA/History era, but after Monster I realized how talented he is and I'm ready to see more from him.

Since I joined the fandom after Kris, Luhan, and Tao left I didn't include them, but I will say Tao looks good in CMB especially the Chinese version.

And while SNSD isn't my bias group, I think Taeyeon killed the IGAB and Mr. Mr. eras, The Boys was Jessicas, Seohyun looked amazing in You Think^(that split though), Sunny also was amazing in You Think because she got to sing in her normal range and she sounded great, and Yuri (and her legs) looked great in Lion Heart.

So, what are your favorite eras/concepts on each member of your bias group?

P.S. Sorry for the long post. I wanted to give a reason why I picked each concept, and my explanations just happen to be really long. Sorry!

###Things to announce

Back in June, we [opened up applications for adding new moderators to the subreddit.](https://redd.it/4p2qkx) Sorry, it took a long time to narrow down the list. We as moderators got busy in the month of July.

Without further delays, we are pleased to announce our latest additions to the /r/kpop moderation team.

* /u/HallyuNoona
* /u/ClosingScroll
* /u/BrigidAndair

Make sure to say hi to them if you see them comment on this thread. They've been at it for the past week now. 

###Things to discuss

As a moderation team, we've been discussing internally about making a change in regards to the following rule:

&gt; The only music show performances that can be posted outside of the compilation thread are comeback/debut stages, goodbye stages, special stages, and winner videos.

What we've been discussing internally in regards to changing this rule:

* Weekly music shows (specifically the ones listed on the sidebar) will now have AutoModerator generated discussion threads that will be posted on the start time of the show. The discussion thread will also act as the compilation thread for the weekly music show. (**[POLL](https://www.strawpoll.me/10968826)**)

* Should every single performance by an artist / group during their comeback / debut stage be posted as individual submission links?  (**[POLL](https://www.strawpoll.me/10968833)**)

* Change how winners for weekly music shows are announced on the subreddit. The spoiler tag does not work for people who use mobile apps or disable the subreddit theme. Make the submission title vague in regards to the winner as an example ""Today's Winner for Mnet M! Countdown (160811)"".   (**[POLL](https://www.strawpoll.me/10968841)**)

We are now looking for the subreddit's opinion about this matter. There are strawpolls next to each bullet point. Make your opinion is heard in the polls as well as in the comments section of this thread.

Since last time, we've rolled out that users [can now edit their own user flairs](https://redd.it/4q1s87) and added new flairs for submissions.

If you have any questions or concerns, just leave a comment and we'll help you out.

###Things to look forward to

Later on this month, the 2016 census will be out. The results from 2015 /r/kpop [census](https://redd.it/3jow9k/).


###TL;DR

We added new mods. We are looking to make a change to the music show performances rule. We have the 2016 census coming up.",104,99

Now I'm in love (I've had ""Pandora"" on repeat for the last few days tbh), even though they disbanded at the beginning of this year.",128,54

[Here is the translation by @knkslp1025] (https://twitter.com/knkslp1025/status/763727245546430465/photo/1) via [Omonatheydidnt] (http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/18655589.html) 
&gt; YG Entertainment (henceforth YG) has recently revealed a girl group BLACKPINK, 7 years after the debut of 2NE1. BLACKPINKs music has received great response immediately after its release and quickly swept away No.1 place on music charts.
&gt; The press and media are praising on and on how YG has given birth to yet another Monster Rookie. It is no wonder YG is receiving such praise as all of its artists, from BIGBANG who debuted in 2006, 2NE1, WINNER, IKON to BLACKPINK, have made a great impression on the public for the past 10 years.

&gt; Not only these groups, but artists discovered through SBSs show Kpopstar, such as AKDONG MUSICIAN and LEEHI, had successful debuts as well. On top of these artists, there are trainees, well known to the public even before their debut, such as Hanna Jang and Sooah Moon who are anticipated as ready runners to take the Monster Rookie title to follow their predecessing senior artists.

&gt; However, a splendid debut not always lead to the road to success. Rookies need more opportunities and appearances as they further develop their musical capabilities, but it is difficult to receive such opportunities among the strong line of artists in YG.

&gt; During the past few years, there were cases where YG had debuted rookie artists in splendor, but left these artists without any activities or appearances for long periods of time.

&gt; The representative case is WINNER. In 2014, WINNER has brought up multiple songs such as Empty, Color Ring, and Dont Flirt to mega hit at the same time, receiving praise as the next big YG rookie after BIGBANG.
&gt; However, WINNER had a long hiatus of approximately a year and a half until they released their next album EXIT: E. Instead of leading WINNER to continue on their sweeping upturn, YG put more effort into IKONs debut, resulting in WINNER losing their opportunity to rise to the next level.
&gt; After a long wait, WINNER released their mini album last February, but YG wrapped up WINNERs activities in just a month.

&gt; After wrapping up their activities, WINNER tried to make up to their saddened fans by appearing on TV via JTBCs entertainment show Halfmoon Friends (a.k.a Bandalfriends) for 3 months. However, what the fans really wanted to see wasnt WINNER taking care of children but WINNER singing on stage.

&gt; Moreover, it took 3 years for LEEHI to release her next album SEOULITE after her 1st full album First Love in 2013, and AKDONG MUSICIAN spent 2 years in between their debut album PLAY and their 2nd album Spring Vol.1.

&gt; Of course, an artists break cannot always be short. If an artist made improvement where one needed and strived to further hone their musical skills, the time spent in hiatus cannot be considered a waste.

&gt; Even so, considering the talent and potential LEEHI and AKDONG MUSICIAN have, the YG imposed hiatus will remain as a frustrating time for both the artists and fans.

&gt; It is also assumed that Minzy, former 2NE1 member, left for the same reasons although she wasnt a rookie. 2NE1 has been in fact on a break after their 2nd full studio album CRUSH in February of 2014 due to multiple internal reasons within the group.

&gt; Although it may have been impossible for 2NE1 to make group appearances, if the company had supported Minzy even a little like it did for CL or Sandara, YG and Minzy would not have had to go separate ways.

&gt; Whether they are Monster Rookies, rookies are rookies. The longer they stay away from media exposure, the faster public loses interest. Then, rookies lose their opportunity to grow as artists.

&gt; Rather than focusing on endlessly producing Monster Rookies, YG needs to pay attention to managing already-debuted rookie artists for them to grow into fiercer artists.",169,320

As a newcomer to the kpop world, I'm interested in hearing some veteran fans' thoughts as many groups lose members and disband. Not to mention, there's definitely a change in style - in the music, visual styling, etc - based on contemporary trends. 



Do you think you will lose interest in kpop, or is this a shift you're interested in following? In five years, do you see yourself as an avid kpop fan?",166,101

One of the unique things I hear in kpop, and never in any other music, is that usually the male singers have a breathy chest voice and soft vowels, so much so that even the ""i(ee)"" vowel sounds soft. In my experience, I'm a jpop singer and enthusiast. But with all the tenor voices I've heard which span a large range from low tenor to countertenor, I've never heard any singer who REMOTELY had this breathy soft chest voice sound that kpop singers have. I'm a lyric tenor myself and i always find myself singing at a much sharper level than with those kpop singers.

So I guess the questions are, do kpop singers practice specifically to just have a breathy chest voice and soft vowels, and/or, is there some kind of equalization magic going on that's cutting out a lot of the transients and sharp sounds. I havent found any information in english about mixing in kpop, but it'd be interesting to know how it's done, besides all the obvious autotune crap.

Also does korean naturally have softer vowels?",10,15

China does not provide stable enough internet to even access Reddit. Things will be back to normal now for both this show and Girl Spirit.

Show format:

- There are 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 Audience members who have votes. (Always adds up to 99)
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

**Judges - In their seating order**

||||Judges||||

Round 1 format: The two singers sing a duet, and the loser performs the song that they would have sang in the second round, while revealing themselves.

This reminded me of some photos that were leaked from the set of one (or more) of CL's music videos for her US debut, so I went digging, and I found three photos:

* One posted by YG himself: [YGS INSTAGRAM UPDATE: #CL #NEWSINGLE #NEWMV #NOWSHOOTING (AUGUST 18, 2015)](https://clthebaddestfemale.com/2015/08/19/photo-ygs-instagram-update-cl-newsingle-newmv-nowshooting-august-18-2015/)

* One **confirmed** from ""Lifted"": [AREY BRADSHAWS IG: BEHIND THE SCENES SHOT FROM @CHAELINCL MUSIC VIDEO SHOOT CALLED LIFTED (AUGUST 19, 2015)](https://clthebaddestfemale.com/2015/08/20/photo-carey-bradshaws-ig-behind-the-scenes-shot-from-chaelincl-music-video-shoot-called-lifted-august-19-2015/) The photo has since been deleted from his Instagram.

* Another that included a green screen in the background: [VAL PERRES INSTAGRAM UPDATE: GREAT WORKING WITH YOU #CL (AUGUST 20, 2015)](https://clthebaddestfemale.com/2015/08/21/photo-val-perres-instagram-update-%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%91%B6%F0%9F%8F%BCgreat-working-with-you%F0%9F%91%B6%F0%9F%8F%BC%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-cl-august-20-2015/)

I believe that all three of these photos are from the set of ""Lifted"" since they posted in the span of only three days. I'm excited because it was filmed when CL had her beautiful gray/silver hair and Pony was her makeup artist.

1655,2016-8-18,2016,8,18,13,4ya78p,Male vocal group Circus Crazy (includes ex-LC9 members) has released their debut single 'Circus Crazy',tastetherainbeau,1471493068,"[Here is Circus Crazy on MelOn] (http://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=2704719). The title track,  ' ' translates to 'Boy's Diary.'

Circus Crazy debuted in Japan this past March and has performed over 100 concerts there but this is their first domestic release. They are under C2L Entertainment.

Here is Circus Crazy's [Facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/circuscrazy2016/), [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/CIRCUS__CRAZY), and [Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTGoftaT5YjAA1VoF35-MA)

History of the members:

All of the members were under Nega Network, which was the company Brown Eyed Girls was under.

3 of the members (Kevin, Daehan, and Mingyu) were under Nega Network's group R-Team, and I'm not sure if they debuted or not. They had some activities in Japan. Mingyu was also a back-up dancer for BEG.

2 members debuted under the group LC9 in this company, whose debut song featured Gain. The song was called Mama Beat. [Here's the MV] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrV_BcWxJRU). Warning - slight gore. King (now Dingo) is the one with the white hair sticking straight up and J-Hyo (now Kizo) is the one in the leopard print jacket ([here's the dance version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbakO4ubPc8), J-Hyo has the dark pinkish hair)

1869,2016-8-20,2016,8,20,23,4ypbk9,[Fanaccount] Oh My Girl's 1st Concert - Summer Fairytale,omobolasire,1471703923,"Hey everyone!    
So I just got home from the first day of Oh My Girl's weekend concert series. There are many many concerts happening in Seoul this weekend but I chose to support my girls with their first two ever concerts! They're taking place at Samsung Blue Card Hall in Itaewon, which has a capacity of about 3000 people.    
    
Thought I'd share some of the things that happened today:    
    
* I arrived at the venue at around 10:30 this morning, and by then all the fan banners and glowsticks were already sold out! The other merch quickly sold out too. I was told that there'll be more available tomorrow, and iirc they'll be limiting it to one piece of each merch per fan because people bought in bulk. As consolation, they sold discounted plain green lightsticks which included a photocard. I got Mimi but I traded for YooA who's my bias. Besides that, I didn't get any official merch but that's ok because all the fangoods I received made up for it.    
    
* The girls opened the show with Closer, which was gorgeous. Four of the members were up on swings that came down from the ceiling and they each had short white dresses on, with hair accessories. Each had their own style, I think Arin and Binnie's really suited them but they all looked gorgeous.    
    
* The first VCR was a parody called ""OMGketmon GO!"" parodying Pokmon Go ofc. It was super cute and Mimi, YooA and Hyojung got caught, which showed that they'd have their own solo stages. IDK if the other girls will do their own tomorrow or not...    
    
* Mimi did a solo cover of Zico's ""Boys and Girls"" and she KILLED IT. Then, Hyojung and YooA covered ""Bitch I'm Madonna"" and holy crap. I never knew Hyojung could pull off the sexy concept so well but she is FIERCE! She honestly blew me away.    
    
* The girls then went on to do kinda a flirty/sexy/cutesy look for a few songs. Lots of mesh and shorts and crop tops but nothing inappropriate, esp. for the younger members. I can really seeing them pulling off that vibe well (a la Sistar) in a few years.    
    
* They performed all their singles and then some, songs like Sugar Baby, B612, Playground, Je T'aime, I Found Love... It was a pretty big setlist!    
    
* Baro from B1A4 was in the audience tonight!    
    
    
* As for gender in the audience, I was expecting mostly guys since it's a girl group, but it was pretty even! I even saw a few parents with their kids.    
   
     
I don't know if there's any much else I can comment on, but I am going to the next show tomorrow afternoon. If you want, I'll let you guys know if there's any changes. If you have any questions too, go ahead and ask and hopefully I can answer them. I'm so proud of Oh My Girl!!!

I'm just home from the second day of Summer Fairytale. I posted my experience yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4ypbk9/fanaccount_oh_my_girls_1st_concert_summer/). There were a few changes from yesterday to today so I thought I'd make a quick post!    
    
* Merch sold out AGAIN today! Luckily I got my hand on a lightstick. Fan goods were mostly the same as yesterday so I only collected a few extra fans to give to my Miracle friends who weren't able to attend the concert.    
    
* I was sitting a little further back today but my view was still fantastic. Staff were buzzing around my area before the concert started and it turns out that members of Yooa's family ended up sitting next to me and my friend. They were very sweet and energetic!    
    
* This time, the other girls got to perform. Binnie, Jiho, Arin and JinE got to perform mini solos, bookended by Knock Knock. They all did great but Binnie sang a beautiful ballad. Girl has PIPES and I wish they'd let her use them more! I'm not quite sure each song the girls sang but once I find out I'll update this post :)    
    
* Seunghee had her moment to shine when she covered ""Ugly"" by 2NE1. She started off acoustically (she played the guitar herself!) and it grew from there. I think some WM trainees were her backup dancers. She really put her all into the performance... Her eyes brimmed with tears at one point and all you could hear from the audience was ""Don't cry! You're so beautiful!"". It was so touching ;_;    
    
* The concert was a little bit longer today but that's because the girls talked a lot more. We even had a boys vs. girls vs. Oh My Girl screaming match hahahaha    
    
* At one point Arin took a sip of water and a fanboy screamed ""UWAH OUR ARIN IS DRINKING WATER!"". She then proceeded to spit the water all over herself and the stage, she was so embarrassed hahaha    
    
* During their thank yous, Binnie started to cry, which caused Mimi to cry, which set off Yooa and Jiho... Binnie ran off the stage at one point, I thought she was grabbing a tissue. Turns out she had written a letter which she read out. The stereotypical ""kpop emotional moment piano music"" started and all the girls started to bawl! Poor Yooa wasn't even using her mic and you could hear her sobs throughout the theatre. You can really tell these girls love each other and their fans. There was lots of group hugs. They got right back into the groove of things though with ""Windy Day"", and within the first few seconds, you couldn't even tell they were so emotional just moments before! (Side note: right before the lights went out after cryfest, Mimi screamed ""TURN UP"" and I died)    
    
* Sandeul, Gongchan and CNU from B1A4 were in the audience tonight! My friend actually sat two rows in front of them and apparently they were fanboying hard, and were getting a kick out of the other fanboys. They also laughed at the girls for being so emotional, even CNU tagged one of his photos #crybabies. Jinyoung was unable to attend the concert because of his drama filming, but Gongchan [tried to](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJXgblzAAuv/?taken-by=gongchanida) make up for it... Hehehe. Such good big brothers. 
    
* Honestly this concert was 95% live, and I didn't hear one single botched high note. Seunghee held her Cupid note for FOREVER! Bravo, ladies.    
    
I'm so not ready to go back to real life. I'm itching to see Oh My Girl again! Seriously, if you get the chance, GO SEE THEM. Such a fun, heart-warming experience! ",34,105

Japan was amazing. Enough said. And now I'm back! (oh, that feeling when I realized I had seen my entire top8 most listened to recently list on Spotify live...)  
Before I left I had an request to use play instead of open on the Spotify links. So I changed! I hope it was an improvement, or that you are at least neutral to it.  
Also, question! Would it be better to make the monthly playlists more listenable by only adding title tracks rather than entire album? Or should I keep it as it is?",17,100

* B: **If you could design part of the ceremonies, what would you include?

I'm part of a small Swedish research team looking at new ways to do music discovery.

As part of this research I've built a website which lets you find music by generating kpop playlists using three different methods.

If anyone is interested in trying it out and leaving feedback I'd be very grateful!

The website is: http://musicdiscovery.se

Thank you, and if you have any questions I'll be glad to try to answer them!

Edit: I should mention that your answers in the feedback tab are of course anonymous, but will be used for evaluation purposes. Again, thank you to everyone who's left feedback so far, your help is invaluable!

Sorry for not having the names of the songs, but if you leave a comment with the song ID (4 numbers which are shown where the name should be) I will try to identify it for you.",25,48

2032,2016-8-23,2016,8,23,7,4z35j0,"Question: If you could see one K-pop artist or group on a British TV show (BBC, etc.), which artist/group and which show would you choose and why?",SantosPhillipCarlo,1471904559,"Quick question that actually started in the discussion of [the GFriend *Knowing Bros* episode that had just been English-subbed](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4z1goz/eng_sub_ask_us_anythingknowing_bros_episode_38/) and got into talk of Chrome add-ons for Korean TV and even BBC iPlayer. /u/MrKunie helped get the ball rolling on this.

Me:

&gt; Quick question - if you had to put one idol or group on a BBC show, which artist(s), which show and why?

/u/MrKunie

&gt; *The Graham Norton Show* for sure since a lot of the shows I love are, err, a bit too British and I've been told our style of humor and way of doing things can be quite alien to first timers. The Graham Norton show would be ideal since it is a chat show but Graham Norton manages to make it very funny at the same time.

&gt; As for one idol or group...BTOB maybe? Everytime I see BTOB on anything they manage to make me smile and laugh. I guess the cop-out answer would be SNSD since Tiffany speaks English (was about to put Jessica as well and then felt sad =[ ot9). Wendy would be awesome, actually, come to think of it. She speaks English, is talented AF and would be an awesome ambassador for promoting K-Pop in the UK. But if it wasn't just idols my choice it would be Yoo Jae Suk - only problem is that he doesn't speak English.

Me:

&gt; Oh, dear Lord. I'm getting a grin over the image of some fan in the chair doing the dance from *Ice Cream Cake* and Wendy stopping Graham from pulling the lever.

&gt; PS: I half wonder if I should make a thread where folks like you can discuss it, but I wonder if that'd be too narrow scope (not sure how much intersection there is between K-Pop and British television fans.)

/u/MrKunle:

&gt; There must be a few of us around =p Also, Wendy would stop Graham and then he would order them back in the chair and then pull the lever XD

&gt;Following Sulli's controversial post, netizens have continuously criticized the idol stars and even declared a boycott of all brands promoted by Sulli. Many have also emailed 'Johnson &amp; Johnson' to notify them about the ""disturbing"" and ""inappropriate"" way the two K-Pop stars represented the brand. 

&gt;In response to the concerns, 'Johnson &amp; Johnson' stated, ""Thank you very much for reaching out to us with your concerns. We at Johnson's do not condone the objectification of any persons, and appreciate your flagging this misrepresentation of our brand. Please know that we do not take any such incidents lightly and have flagged this issue to our management teams for review and action. Once again, we appreciate your support in reporting the issue, and helping us maintain the values we hold dear."" 

&gt;Could Sulli and Hara be facing some serious trouble for their picture? Stay tuned for updates.

&gt;The music director of the dramas OST, Gaemi, also lead the production of the OST for hit drama Descendants of the Sun. I Think Im Done Sleeping is a song that portrays the emotions behind the dramas lead characters (Lee Young played by Park Bo Gum and Hong Ra On played by Kim Yoo Jung) gradual development of feelings towards each other after their surprising first meeting by describing the feeling of not being able to fall asleep. The song previews the emotions that the two characters develop toward each other.

&gt;I Think Im Done Sleeping is a collaboration between music director Gaemi and hit song composer Kim Se Jin, which features the smooth and sweet vocals of Soyou and Yoo Seung Woo accompanied by a calm accompaniment.

I've always admired the work and creativity that goes into designing a kpop album cover, some of them even winning design awards (like The Boys-SNSD) and I consider that to be an amazing branding tool that determine people to buy the respective albums. I love albums with a creative concept like Gain's Hawwah (biblical themed) or The Boys (fairytale themed). Do you know anymore albums with amazing designs and great creative concepts? Are you guys influenced by how an album looks when you buy it?  
 
 I really want to do my dissertation thesis on this topic, but I dunno if I am going to be allowed (I am from Romania, teacher insists on making something on a topic Romanian related, but Romanian music and album design are two parallel lines =)) ). If you have done something similar in college, any tip is welcomed. Thank you so much!

Later edit: Considering the fact that we are talking about kpop, I have reconsidered and I think I can focus on the design of the entire album, not only the cover. The whole yearbook theme that EXO's XOXO had going was a concept declined on the entire album.",19,22

2181,2016-8-25,2016,8,25,8,4zfjwk,[Discussion] What are your favourite special stages/cover performances?,urangutang,1472082009,"I always love discovering new special stages or other cover performances, they tend to show a different side of the idols than usual. So give me your faves and I'll list some of mine!

**Up10tion** never fail to deliver, and both their [boygroup medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb0OeLeO_LM) and performance of [Dash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSv_rVYUSYI) on Immortal Song are amazing.

Oh man that **KNK/Snuper/Astro** cover of [Growl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX-q3rM-wxQ) was such a hot mess but I love performances with different groups. And of course [Ultra Dance Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxQSJUrHpz8) which was over too soon. 

For some reason 90s sound just suits **BtoB** perfectly making their cover of [I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HaLSstCDZs) one of my favourites. And then there's their [incredible performance on Immortal Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4qyesUUI5c) two weeks ago. Those harmonies are insane. [I will also never get over this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T5sdrmPmQo). How can they be such little shits but at the same time stand there and put down this amazing performance??? 

**SPICA** doing anything is a gift to humanity, but especially [It's Raining Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku-8ifqmCVQ&amp;index=10), oh wait should I say Men Are Falling From the Sky Like Rain? And of course [No Diggity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGKTxZuX4mk). More beautiful harmonies. And speaking of killer vocal groups, I'm still dead from that time **Mamamoo** sang [Delilah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfC23ZZjNw) on Immortal Song. 

The whole of **Infinite** singing Sunggyu's solo [60 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJhn-aK6lpM) is also a good one! And I will never be over **Monsta X**'s cover of [Mirotic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttuXT43Lw4M). Wonho how dare you. And then of course there's the obligatory **BTS** [Perfect Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMMx1hOwH-4), if I don't mention it someone else will (and rightly so!). 

And how could I forget [Mr. Chu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hgcT89OMtE), or should I say Miss Chu? And the really old and super cringey [Loving You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIb9HMOHYNk&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

That was about it for my faves, do share yours!",72,54

- The 11-13 Celebrity Judges and 86-88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

&gt; Every year, the 'Idol Star Athletics Championships' results in some sort of injury for a lot of idols. Because of this, many fans call for the ending of the series. 

&gt; Filming for the '2016 ISAC' is currently underway with futsal as the first game, and it's now been made known that BTS' Jin is the first serious injury this year. He was elbowed by ZE:A's Dongjun in the face, and was escorted off the field because of the bleeding. Rap Monster, who was also in the game, was shocked and tried to follow.

&gt; There are no official reports, but rumors say that the staff was talking about taking Jin to a hospital because the bleeding would not stop. Also, he bled so much that the staff actually had to come and wipe his blood off the field. However, Rap Monster reassured fans that if it was really serious, he wouldn't be playing but with Jin. Reports also say Dongjun expressed incredible guilt, and apologized to the fans, but the fans did not hold him at fault at all.

Big Hit Ent. gave an [update] (http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/08/big-hit-entertainment-reassures-fans-jin-is-fine-says-hes-resting-back-in-the-dorms):

&gt; For worried fans, Big Hit Entertainment said, *""The injury is not serious, and he had emergency treatment on site. For his health, we moved him right away to the dorms. He's not filming and he's resting right now.""*

Jin later posted an update on Twitter (article from [Soompi] (http://www.soompi.com/2016/08/29/btss-jin-assures-fans-hes-alright-injury-idol-star-athletics-championships/)):

&gt; In the evening on August 29, Jin [tweeted a selfie] (https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/770228873137049601) of himself with the text *Listen to me, Army. Im alright.* Jin fans recently adopted the phrase Listen to me, Seokjin as a meme after an international fan tweeted to Jin in imperfect Korean using the phrase. After Jin noticed and tweeted to ask what it was on August 28, Listen to me, Seokjin became the second highest trending topic on Twitter in Korea that evening.

&gt; Jin tweeted soon after, *I was all ready with the army bombs [BTS light sticks] But the other kids played with you, right?*.

2466,2016-8-29,2016,8,29,17,50437y,"[Writeup] The SM ""Box"" MV",Kilenaitor,1472460983,"This post was inspired by a conversation I had recently with a friend of mine who got into Kpop fairly recently (about 1 year ago). We were talking about SM music videos, specifically Red Velvet and Taeyeon, and I offhandedly remarked ""Funny to see the difference in SM MVs now that they stopped with 'the box' concept"". My friend had no idea what I was talking about, which caught me off guard. So, I thought I'd do a little writeup for fun. :) 

SM was known for always having the same concept when it came to MVs. A lot of fans dubbed this ""The SM Box"" and it was their standard format for *years*. The Box was the same for pretty much every MV: It featured an enclosed set with the main artist and possibly backup dancers doing the choreography to the song with a few closeup cuts and maybe a one or two set changes. Maybe a short (&lt; 30 second) intro to the MV and some totally rad special effects, but majority was in the box. There are a couple minor variations and nuances, but for the gist of it, that's how every single SM music video was. 

Notable examples:  
[Super Junior  Sorry, Sorry](https://youtu.be/x6QA3m58DQw?t=20)  
[Super Junior  Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GpJHF0WyAE)  
[f(x)  Electric Shock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8I8QGFA1oM)  
[SHINee Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKbNV-4b_g8)  
[SNSD  I Got A Boy](https://youtu.be/wq7ftOZBy0E?t=29)   
[TVXQ  Humanoids](https://youtu.be/XAC5KRMyiQk?t=20)  
[EXO  History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdejiaoEhFc)  

Solos weren't safe either:  
[Henry  Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXB5eRMRno)  
[BoA  Hurricane Venus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz7Gstx5ogk)  

You get the idea. Every group did it, same concept. Now, I will note, EXO's MAMA was one of the first to be somewhat different because there was a sort of ""story"" to it; it even had a 97(!) second intro and some superpower cutaways. Unthinkable. However, largely the same box concept. 

Now to some of you older fans, you are well aware of this. But to you newer fans, this was so commonplace it was not weird to see YouTube comments referring to it. People complained near *constantly* about SM. f(x)'s Rum Pum Pum Pum MV was the big one I remember a lot of people upset by it being yet *another* box video. 

But then, this all changed (drastically), in about one month with the debut of one specific SM Girl Group.   
Yup, you guessed it. **Red Velvet**. 

This is Red Velvet's debut MV, [Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgv8bKfxEs).   
.  
.  
.  
## WHA^A^A^A^a^a^a^a^t?! 
There's all these colors, and pretty animations, and movement, and features!!! Now, there is still the concept of an enclosed set, but all in all, drastically different. 

But, what marked this as especially unique (not just the normal kind of unique) was that it wasn't just Red Velvet that got these fancy new non-Box, semi-having-plot MVs. It was spilling into other artists too! 

Super Junior went from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIkiI_UmeE) to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krT35dgDM) to more recently, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwERHxXcTs). Talk about a transformation!  

SHINee went from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kyG5tTZ1iE) to [this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF53cptEE5k)

f(x) went from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnku4o3tRB4) to [this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7Umwfx60Q)  
 
Also notably,  

TVXQ releases [Champagne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQajFf6IYQ).  

Taeyeon releases [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OrCA1OInoo). 

Exo releases [Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSH-FVVtTf0). 

NCT debuts and releases [Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6OcvS54KYQ) and most recently, [Fire Truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_psXn_VJ_AE)  


SM ditched the box and it ditched it *hard*. Long gone are the dance-only MVs with a bit of flare, the three-walled sets, and the sporadic single closeups intermixed with fast-cut, dance angles. We have **full color** now, and **stories**, and the outdoors! 

So yes. All in the span of one month, August, 2014, SM went from the same-MV-for-everyone label to some of the best MVs I have seen in a while with a newfound aesthetic (I know, I know) a la NCT's [7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA) (which, coincidentally, is the most box-like thing they have released since and this was more of a dance/performance MV anyway), outdoor scenery a la TaeYeon's [Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkdtmT8A2iY), and even plot (yes, plot!) a la Taemin's [Press Your Number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsOGiTSZ_cg) which features cutins of the *DANCING* not the not-dancing parts! 

Some of you have totally noticed this. And hopefully this was at least fun to read through and see some of your favorite ( or least favorite =] MVs). But for those of you more recent to the KPop scene where everyone has MVs like Twice's [Chorup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7rCyll5AeY), Infinite's [Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1oTSAhdzNQ), Big Bang's [Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CTced9CMMk), and BTS's [Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wn85Ge22FQ), just know, the MV scene was very different for a long, long, long time. :) 

So yeah! That's SM's Box. A relic of a time gone past in the KPop world. It's funny how fast things change. We go from box MVs and heavily autotune-stylized vocals ([don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww9UjJ4Dt8) [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSOSxwEWFA4) [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhseD2tRLUY) [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ZrPFMr_nY)), to a new era of not just MVs, but SM as a whole too. Hell, Red Velvet got to do a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0) that was criticizing the idol industry of the manufacturing of talent. Funny coming from a company that is known for being especially controlling of its talent, their image, and the content they produce. 

Any notable examples I missed? Do you miss the box MV (I sometimes do...)? Have you been a fan forever and never noticed? Are you brand new and noticed right away as you looked through older stuff? Would love to hear your thoughts!

Edit: NCT debuted with 7th Sense, not Without You. Off by a day! Also removed snarky tldr.

2597,2016-8-31,2016,8,31,13,50fh0i,[Discussion] Idol's Privacy...where do you draw the line?,FluxusJeffrey,1472618620,"So, the past couple days, I've seen a couple posts dealing with idol's privacy and /r/kpop's response has me a bit confused on where people think the line is. This can be a touchy subject so I'm trying to phrase my opinion in a non argumentative way, but my writing sucks so i'll probably fail in this endeavor, so i'll just trust in the good nature of the people in the sub to be civil. Ex Kaistal Escape room pic -- ""leave them alone!"" ""invasion of privacy!"" ""lawsuit!"" but for the SM trip, ""what did SM expect"" ""planned this"" "" blame SM.""

For me, when it comes to celebrity public figures (in this case idols), I feel the standards of privacy are different from the general public. It might come off as victim blaming, but when it comes with the job territory, I think it's a bit different. As an idol, you spend most of your rookie career sacrificing your privacy trying to get noticed, but when you do, you have to accept everything that comes of it, good and bad. I think (hope) most people would agree with me that everyone in their *personal* private space is entitled to absolute privacy though I feel it is the idol's responsibility to take extra measures to secure this space (consciously closing blinds, tinting car windows, security systems, etc). In public, they are completely fair game keeping within the limits of the law...because it's the public. Where it gets gray is in non-personal private spaces. 

When Kai and Krys-- I mean that trainer and seal were in hotel pool, that's a private space, but its privacy is inclusive of hotel staff, other guests, and law breaking paparazzi. I'm not saying that it makes it ok or it's not an invasion of privacy, but given their job description and who they are, I put more accountability on the idols. It's the same for the Escape Room. They went out, someone in that space got an image of them, it's the risk they take going out/being public figures. 

SM on the other hand was in a hotel where sasaeng fans were following. That is their temporary home with expectations of privacy should be handled by the hotel. The lobby, though is accessible to the public, is private and the hotel should be asking non-guests to leave...especially if they have VIP guests. The sasaeng behavior probably also impacted the normal SM staff and other hotel guests, but why so little attention on faults of the hotel and sasaengs?

Why do the sentiments differ like this? Is it because SM is not a person and we like to hate on SM? or when its about specific couple, it's more human? It just feels inconsistent to me.",86,51
