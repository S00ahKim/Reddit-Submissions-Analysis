I'm not entirely sure it was kpop or jpop but I just remember that in the video the band members (not sure if they were just a back up band or the actual group) were wearing cardboard heads with a long nose. The guitarist had a red(?) guitar I think. I saw the video somewhere and its been driving me insane trying to find it. Male singers I believe. Thanks for any help!

I am pretty sure there are five girls singing. I think it starts off showing the girls in different places with their boyfriends, the boys stop moving/freeze (I think) and the girls walk away. They meet each other and link arms, then start walking along a road.

At the end of the road there is a large gate and they have to turn back, and are very sad. 

I THINK they start singing about how sorry they are for leaving their boys, but I could just be imaging that.

Does anybody know what this song is? I would be very grateful for any help.

 I'm looking for the second song played after A Pink's [It Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZhSGBpRmaV0#t=53s). It's  on about 75% of the audio clip. It seems to me like it's a male solo singer but it could also be a guy group. Also the answer is not in the comments. It looks to me that after this submission was made (I'm guessing a week or so after) the blogger has extended the audio clip since in the Reddit comments people figured out the first 30 or so songs, but there's like 15 songs after that which no one talked about.

I sent my cousin CL's [new song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LP4foN3Xs4), and he sent me [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sGvVNUHFmv0) (i don't know if we can call it that, since it's so short).
The beggining sounds so much alike! What do you guys think? I'm not implying anything btw, I love CL's new style, I just found it interesting.

(p.s.: for those wondering, made a self post since my link post got deleted because it wasn't kpop related, so it's not a repost, just me not knowing how to use reddit :) )

* Any good variety shows/diary shows/interviews/videos/behind-the-scenes/dance rehearsals etc.?

Well-known groups (even *really* well-known ones), rookies, groups who aren't around any more, whatever. This could also be a chance to share some groups who you feel are under-appreciated. Feel free to request groups you want to know more about, too.

I was just wondering that if the members of EXO-K and EXO-M mirror each other through the whole song, meaning that member A in EXO-K does **exactly** what member B in EXO-M and vice versa (applies to the other 10 members). If they do, do they keep the same roles throughout different promotions, or do they switch around? I cannot read faces very well and was wondering this for a long time.",5,9

18. Spica
19. HelloVenus
20. AOA

22. Fiestar

It's highly unlikely that the top 2 will change in a long while, but the notable movers would be T-ara dropping out of the Top 10, and Girl's Day slowly making their way up. Hipster /r/kpop's favourite, Crayon Pop was however not ranked.

As you might or may not know, Starcraft was an _insanely_ popular game in korea, drawing crowds you could never believe -- well, you can, after seeing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5UkQYyuKfA.

Anyway, today, Starcraft is still alive and well, bringing a green line in the budget after each month in Korea, but the international crowd has outgrown the korean one. However, it's still produced in Korea and they play kpop almost exclusively and being a connoisseur of kpop (you might want to look that word up! *chuckle*), I try to spread the good times around as much as I can, over here in Sweden. 

Never knew this reddit existed, only came here for Starcraft. Thanks a bunch, boys and girls, for your good work furthering this great music.

That is all, that was cheesy -- but who cares! ;)",3,0

349,2013-6-12,2013,6,12,2,1g4voi,Why does every Korean group that wants to promote in the US sing in English? Why not try in Korean?,its_dartagnan,1370973100,"I thought of this today: when American musicians promote abroad, they don't change the language of their songs, but Asian artists do. Why is that? I'm in Taiwan, and when groups promote here, at most they say ""ni hao,"" but that's the extent of their Chinese. They don't rewrite songs in Chinese for the Chinese audience.

I'm not going so far as to say Americans are arrogant and think the world should just accept English as the ultimate language delivery system. Financially, there is no reason for the Americans to do anything differently. Their music sells abroad as is, so why change it. In other words, the market decided that songs in English were acceptable. So why not Korean songs?

In Taiwan, when English, Korean, and Japanese MVs are played on TV, there are sometimes subtitles for the lyrics. For all the attention Koreans are giving their Japanese audience, no one is making a Chinese version of their songs. When Korean stars show up on a Taiwanese show, they say, ""ni hao,"" and that's the extent of their interactions in Chinese. So the Koreans are actually promoting themselves in Taiwan just like the Americans would as well.

A reason could be the Korean companies believe their music can thrive untransformed in a Chinese environment, and the Japanese version of songs are just like a special bonus to the Japanese audience. The artists still perform songs in Korean in Japan, so it's not like they've translated every song to fit the audience. The consumption of Kpop in Taiwan has been tremendous, so the Korean companies played their cards right.

In the case of the US, it appears as though the Korean companies looked at the cards in their hands and folded because they don't think the cards are good enough. 

I want to make a case for Kpop to stop making songs in English and instead promote their songs in their original Korean forms. A friend of mine in Taiwan told me they loved Justin Bieber songs. I said his lyrics are so simplistic, and she said, ""it's ok, because I only understand a little of it. And it's catchy!"" Sound familiar? That's most of our feelings for Kpop. I know the lyrics are simplistic in Kpop, and I don't need someone to tell me the two stanzas are exactly the same but with a different girl singing each one. At its bones Kpop is pop. It's pop, with a little bit of mystery in there. There's enough English and basic Korean in there for me to figure out a topic sentence, but also surprises because I don't understand Korean. This formula could work in the pop market in the US. If the songs are instead released in English, what's separating it from Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, or the Backstreet Boys (I learned recently that they're still active)? The songs in Korean are unique, exotic, intriguing, and sometimes refreshing. In English, it's just pop with minor Korean accents that could make you cringe.

While the Korean can stay, some songs, concepts, or MVs would have to change depending on the culture setting. Lately the gangster concept has been played many times, and while it may be cool in Asia, it's not going to fly in the US, so just change the MV (US Version. Imagine seeing that next to a youtube MV title.). I've also heard my friends say the males are just too effeminate sometimes, so how about in the US version they don't wear makeup and change the choreography. Girls are too cute for Americans? How about a girl next door concept a la Taylor Swift. Extra money and time would have to be sacrificed for this new audience, but it beats throwing good money after bad.

2 years ago, Google had a Kpop concert at its headquarters at Mountain View, CA. The Bay Area has a lot of Asians. More specifically, there are Asians who are not afraid to listen to Asian music. The concert had artists like Kara perform songs in Korean, and in the case of Kara, Nicole came out and addressed the audience in English. Kpop has a foothold in the US, and it doesn't even know or care. There is an audience for whom Kpop is perfect for. Some are on the fence about Kpop, while some are willing to give Kpop a try if the right song is presented. These are the people the company should cater to. The companies seem to be more interested in turning doubters into believers.

TL;DR: Kpop has a chance in the US if it promotes in Korean instead of English.",10,0

390,2013-6-13,2013,6,13,7,1g88s0,Do you think the inability to fully sing live hurts kpop artists trying to make it in the West?,lampzilla,1371077133,"This crossed my mind when I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWcQbrZXpU) of the Wonder Girls performing Like Money live. They seemed to be moving around *so* much something I had never noticed when they sang in Korean. Their voices suffered for it, though I guess it could be due to their general mood too. 

I know that while many idols can sing perfectly well their companies often edit or alter their voices to match their ideas for songs. Aside from acapella or a special stage most idols don't usually fully sing live, they usually have a backing track to pick up the slack. It seems to me that in kpop, vocal talent is important, but as every stage is treated almost like a full blown concert the visual package is just as important. If they sacrifice singing live to create a visually stunning stage, so be it.

In the West, we currently have this preference for 'natural' live, raw talent. We eat that shit up at reality shows, and we expect our artists to sing live. Remember the whole scandal when Beyonce didn't sing live at President Obama's Inauguration? Even though we understand that artists use backing tracks, it seems there's the overwhelming desire to have our artists be 'natural'. 

There are so many other barriers to entry for Kpop idols, mastery of the English language being one of them, but I wonder if the ability to perform live is also an issue.",20,6

And then they let it bleed over into real life and treat all good looking (or not) Koreans like they're going to act like idols do to fans. (We know that idol marketing is often about pretending to be your cute/sexy/mysterious/sweet boy or girlfriend.) It's so unrealistic and really, kind of creepy. 

This is directly comparable to the ~Japan!~ weeaboo craze where some people thought Japan had a deeper, more perfect culture, had the most beautiful women etc., when really, Japanese people are just... people. 

How can you wake someone up from their Korean dream? Realise that cute Korean boy isn't going to be their oppa, that sexy Korean girl is actually a human being who probably just wants to go home and chill on the internet? That being Korean doesn't actually bestow any extra powers of attractiveness or relationship material?

I don't know how to do this, because it's often socially and emotionally immature people. Being direct seems like it could seriously backfire and push them into a defensive corner.",5,1

Sorry for the not-so-great/shaky videos.  Not much 2NE1 content.  And also a lot of content I didn't record (my main purpose of attending wasn't to record videos).  I do regret not recording CL's new song though.

I did take a lot of photos, but quality isn't too great (and I thought the Galaxy S4 was supposed to be badass?).

Once again, sorry for quality.  Hope you enjoy regardless.

523,2013-6-17,2013,6,17,4,1ggwqu,/r/kpop: It's time we have another talk.,fiveSeveN_,1371410885,"In the vein of /u/ironyfree: /r/kpop, we've got to have [another talk](http://redd.it/m5qy1).

Lately this subreddit has seen a decrease in quality content and the rise of selfposts which do little to promote discourse and thoughtful discussion. Not only do these posts fill the frontpage with simple questions can easily be answered, but they also provide little substance for our subscribers to work with in terms of engaging in meaningful conversation.

Some of these posts have had little to no relevance to the Korean pop industry, and while these posts barely qualify as submissions based on our rules, they have their place in the [Friday Free-for-All threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=friday+free-for-all&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on). Other posts are simply frivolous speculation, highly subjective, questions which have been asked numerous times before and can be answered with a search query. The kpop network of subreddits has grown steadily over the past year, and it provides us with another outlet (in addition to IRC and Friday FFA) for these kinds of posts.

I know that others who visit this subreddit share the same sentiments expressed in this post, and before we take action, wed like to hear your thoughts and opinions on how to go about solving this problem.

To combat these issues, weve come up with some solutions which wed like some feedback on:

* Possible addition of a weekly or biweekly General Discussion and Q&amp;A/help thread (Q&amp;A may be a separate thread from discussion)
* Possible addition of a weekly recommendations thread (if you/I like *x*, you/I might like *y*)
* Possible addition of a Whats In Your Playlist (or similarly styled) thread

We are aware that there are many new users who may have not yet familiarized themselves with our submission history and rules. While we are a kpop community, we believe the quality of our discussion can exceed the level of quality typically found on fandoms or blogslets try to keep the primary focus on the music rather than the idols or musicians.

We are grateful for those who spoke out on this topic, whether it was through pure frustration and spite or through reasonable criticism. Know that this issue has been identified by many subscribers of the subreddit in addition to the /r/kpop moderators. **This is change that the community hopes to see.**

As always, thank you for listening.

After School has just come back and E-Young has not got enough lines to merit the claim that she's a 'good singer'. So, i'm feeling inclined, in a way, to shift her from probably underrated and underutilised to the scary prospect of her not being much of a singer. We all know she's a hard-worker, musically talented and a wonderful dancer. Is that enough though?

It reminds me of the time pre-Romantic Fantasy, when I had a similar realisation about Hyoyeon; that perhaps she's incapable of being considered a vocalist. Then comes the time spent trawling through youtube trying to find evidence to suggest otherwise. Such as that radio cover of a Tasha/Yoon Mirae song and compilations of lines from various SNSD songs. Just to assuage the fear that she just might be a terrible singer.  I did the same thing with Sohyun from 4minute too till the recent comeback made those fears less prominent.

So my question to K-Pop Redditers is: When does being ""underrated"" stop being an excuse for a fan's denial of a loved idol being ""untalented?"" 

Do you know what i'm talking about? Can you word it better? lol. Also, if you can share your similar fears here so I don't feel completely sensitive.

Yesterday, I noticed that ""Femme Fatale"" uses the same sample (albeit a bit slower and higher in pitch) as one of the sections in Girls' Generation's ""I Got a Boy.""

Links for comparison:

""[Femme Fatale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfN4d8Mtpk&amp;t=1m31s)"" (1:31)

""[I Got a Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX428S3k0Iw&amp;t=1m35s)"" (1:35)


When producers are all using the same software with finite pre-loaded samples, this kinda stuff is bound to happen, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I thought it might be interesting to see other K-Pop songs that use the same samples.  So, do y'all have any other examples of shared samples in K-Pop?

716,2013-6-24,2013,6,24,4,1gx7vh,[?] Name of currently popular male (solo?) Korean ballad song,Grafeno,1372015194,"~~I'm currently in Korea and over the last few days I've been hearing this one balladish song everywhere. I' m pretty sure it's a solo singer but I guess there's the small chance that it's a band. Don't really know the lyrics, the chorus melody is pretty.. standard though. This isn't Emuch information but because I am absolutely certain that it's currently a really popular song (even though probably not that popular here since it's maybe not really K-Pop) someone should know.~~

~~Oh, the singer sounds voicewise kinda like the guys from 2AM (but I don't think that it is one of them). Tempowise I think it's comparable to 2am's most popular song (think it's.Can't let you go even if you die l, in English~~

~~Edit2: I should've stressed more that stylewise the chorus is really similar to http://youtu.be/hOREkPq1aVQ. It' s interesting how this one seems tough to find, haha. Pretty much every other song I've only heard being played 2 times at most (maybe 4minute (the ireumi mweoyeyo song is theirs right?) 3 times) while I've heard this song like 5 times.~~

FOUND IT after 5everafter's comment kinda pointed me towards the Melon chart. I Ended up being completely wrong on the solo part. It's BEAST - Will you be alright?. I hope you can see how I find the song, especially the chorus comparable to 2am's, though.

802,2013-6-26,2013,6,26,23,1h3z1i,[Need Help please!] Idea for a local kpop dance contest,IceHaku,1372257871,"So people, 

I live in Brazil, and not in the big cities ""So Paulo or Rio de Janeiro"".

Where I live there is almost zero dance competition culture.

---------------------------

Nowadays we have lots of kpop dance groups, people are getting into this more and more each year, but sadly there is almost zero opportunities along the year to perform, 2 events sometimes 3 or 4.

So, I was trying to think in some way to keep people ""hot"" in the large space without a event.

And this is what I came up with.

---------------------

I would create a group/blog/facebook and invite people who like kpop and create a pool.

Everyone choose one music together, maybe 2, and I run a contest to you dance and record that music and send it to me until the end of month.
So, I choose the winner(not only me), and give him/her some money, something like 50-100 reais.

After some months (4-5), I can invite all the winner to perform a music together.

---------------------

**What I hope to Achieve with this**

* Bring more people to dance,
* Give opportunity to people without group show their talent,
* Keep people ""hot"" while wait the next big event,
* Maybe in the future get attention of the local dance academies and promote something bigger. With a really nice prize pool.
* Well, promote kpop =]

------------------------------------

So, I would like to ask, all this shit looks interesting in any way?
How can I make it more fun?

PS: I'm not rich, I'm not a event promoter, I'm just someone who likes kpop and would like to create some nice dance events in my city and bring more people to this.

899,2013-6-29,2013,6,29,17,1havna,"My friend said he was sitting next to a male kpop star on his flight from China to Seoul, but doesn't know who he is. Can I get some help identifying him? (more info in comments)",2xNoodle,1372493015,"So I asked my friend which male kpop artist he sat next to on the plane and he replied with the following:

&gt;No idea. I asked the guy what he was doing in china, he said 'concert', I then asked if he was popular, he said 'kind of'. That's all we talked about. Later when I got out of the baggage zone into the airport foyer I saw a bunch of girls with phones and cameras waiting for him so apparently he is big in Korea. All I can tell you about him is that he is part of a boy group I think based on the other dudes he hung out win that were his age.

I don't think that the guy is necessarily in a boy band just because there were others his age, but I guess chances are he is. Unfortunately, I'm not very well versed with boy bands/male performers.

Which male Korean artists had a concert in China that they'd be just returning from? Or a concert in a location that would result in a layover in China? Any other clues to look for?

EDIT: Could it have been a B2ST member returning from AIA in Kuala Lampur?

**EDIT 2:** Friend just messaged me saying that they guy had acne. I guess it could be any of the China Friendship Concert members who wasn't hiding his acne at the time...

EDIT 3: Thanks for the responses guys and gals \^_^ I'm gonna let my friend enjoy his vacation and pester him about it in August, although I doubt we'll get anywhere.",28,34
