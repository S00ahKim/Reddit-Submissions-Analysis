I occasionally will watch a Running Man episode or Infinity Challenge, but I often enjoy more talk-oriented shows or ones with silly games (Idol Maknae Rebellion, anyone?) I see references to them on allkpop and clips on youtube, but rarely full episodes. I know this is a general question, but I don't how to me more specific, because I don't know what the shows' names are!

I guess I'm looking for a Korean equivalent to [this website](www.sugoideas.com), where they have a nice long link to tons of variety shows. Suggestions for shows and websites?",37,29

Some of the links have been taken down, I've updated most of them [**here**](http://www.koreaboo.com/index.html/_/music-shows/busker-busker-takes-win-on-mnet-countdown-r21268) but haven't got round to the reddit post yet. If the link is missing check that link first.

I am going to be ordering some k-merch would anyone want to combine orders to save on shipping?!",Imcyberpunk,1381030330,"Like the title says, I will be ordering some stuff from either [yesasia](http://www.yesasia.com/us/en/home.html) or [kpopmart](http://kpopmart.com/) within the next week and I am wondering if anyone would want to combine orders to save on the shipping costs.

kpopmart is not free shipping, but has lower costs

yesasia is free over $25 purchase, but has a higher upfront cost. 

I would essentially total up the order on both sites and go with whichever is cheaper. This would work out if you just want 1 or 2 items that wouldn't make the $25 mark on yesasia by themselves, and the bulk shipping cost would be lower on kpopmart. 

If anyone is interested let me know below or in a PM! Depending on the number of people interested, I could probably just front all the money for the order, then each person pays what their item(s) cost and we equally split the shipping (if there is any).  I live in Burnsville (South Metro) but we could meet anywhere in the cities.

Hi! This is my first week doing this, please be patient as I haven't found links for myself for music shows since CrazyCarrot left youtube a few years ago. I haven't been very into stages recently so if I get song names mixed up or if you could help me with the songs that I labeled that I didn't know you'd be dolls. 
 
I will be updating of course as links arrive and when SBS uploads. For now I'm going to bed! Just wanted to give /u/Pearroc a lil break and show him he didn't need to take care of this and I didn't forget.

172,2013-10-8,2013,10,8,2,1nx8c4,[ALBUM] IU - MODERN TIMES // DISCUSSION THREAD,[deleted],1381168173,"Mods, could you tag this thread as discussion?

I wanted to have a serious discussion about the album, since I think there are lot of little nuances in this one (and the work that IU's producers did were stellar, not to mention the featured artists).

Playlist from the other thread by /u/Pearroc : 

http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1nwxfp/audio_iu_modern_times_full_album/

My thoughts (I'll add to it throughout the day if I discover something new about a track):

**Love of B** is a good opening.  Fast paced, IU's drawl works well, and the Romani-inspired beat was a nice choice.   4 out of 5 stars.

**Everyone Has Secrets** is one of the best female-female collabs this year.  Every part of this song was amazing.  Ga-in's sultry voice is a nice compliment to IU's flightier, less harsh one.  In my top half.  5 out of 5 stars.

**Between the Lips** is my favorite song from the album.  Can't get much better than this.  Thank goodness IU is slowly letting go of the ""aegyo-cute"" and finally maturing.  I think if her scandal had any positives, it was this (they couldn't keep her innocent image for long anyway).  6 out of 5 stars.

I loved **The Red Shoes** on my second listen.  It took a while for WTF was going on in the song to resonate with me.  This is my second favorite track- her voice, the beat...I'd love to choreograph a dance to this.  5 out of 5 stars.

**Modern Times** is cute, but not overly so.  Not my favorite track, but it's good studying music. 3 out 5 stars.

**Bad Day** (lol) is a nice slower track, but IU's ballads either do it for me or they don't.  This one doesn't until 2/3rds into the song (when it gets really, really good), but her voice is absolutely beautiful. 3.5/5 stars until 2:30 when it goes up to 4.5/5 stars.

**Obliviate** is my third favorite song on the album (and it was the first track I listened to).  IU's voice is at her best here and at the end of Bad Day.  5/5 stars.

**Walk With Me, Girl** is good, but not my favorite.  Both artists did well, it just wasn't my type of song.  Choi Baek Ho is the star of this track.  3/5 stars.  

**Havana** is my fifth favorite song.  IU goes into ""Last Fantasy"" mode here, but a little more mature.  4.5/5 stars.

**Gloomy Clock** (IU and Time are my new OTP) is pretty good, but I wish it was a little more fast-paced.  I was waiting for it to pick up near the end...but it didn't.  It should have been longer.  3.5/5 stars (.5 a star is for Jonghyun- that guy makes any song better).  

**Daydream** is absolutely beautiful.  Great male-female collab.  When their voices are together... It's an IU ballad that works for me.  4/5 stars.

**Wait** was the song I was waiting for on this album, and it's my fourth favorite song...and it doesn't have any lyrics until 2/3rds of the way into the track.  4.5/5 stars.

**Voice Mail** is too good to just be a ""bonus track"".  However, it doesn't fit with the rest of the album so I can see why it's a bonus; it reminds me more of her earlier stuff (or what her earlier stuff would be like if she didn't go the Marshmallow/Boo route).  4.5/5 stars.

The album itself is cohesive, well-thought out, IU wrote some nice lyrics, the collaborations were perfectly chosen...my top 10 albums list for the year keeps changing, but I think ""Modern Times"" has a safe spot in it.  If you don't like this musical style, you're probably not going to like most of the tracks, which is a bit of a letdown.  But I do, so I rated this a 4.5/5 out of 5.",8,9

Subsidiary with JYJ",picflute,1381325988,"Info about Cashboxman, CEO of e-Light entertainment in Japan. He has leaked numerous amounts of information about JYJ's activities since their formation and entrance in Japan. A japanese news tabloid was running a story where KARA could be transferring to an S.M. subsidiary. JYJ also may leave C-JeS to join the subsidiary as well.

This person has been nailing most information on the head and even Junsu and Jaejoong have told the man to shut up publically on his twitter account. His [twitter account is in Japanese](http://www.twitter.com)

RT by cashboxman (a request from a fan) (t/n: The real meaning of cashboxman's tweet of Sept 10) ""If you like only Junsu, the 1st day. If you like the 3 members, the middle day. If you like the 5 members, the final day. Please do not be mistaken, it does not mean that the members will perform. But, this is the truth.""

[cashboxman's webcast of Oct 9] (cr:ebian_kei)
The ""hentai"" (t/n: dirty old man) tweetA sincere adult was very nervous, and he said that to Jaejoong (since Sasahara-san said that JJ was 'sexually attractive'.) It was said to JJ by this person, who is very close to JJ. I've immediately made contact to that person, he replied (through the person in between) ""Yes, I said it."" 
Junsu (Youngmi)'s tweets just came out on the same timing.

[cashboxman's webcast of Oct 9] (cr:ebian_kei)
I was told that it was necessary to have a report of Toscana issued, in order to get interviews for Jaejoong's June concert. I've denied this offer, than, there was a disagreement.
CMThere are offers from cars and cosmetics companies, but if the current situation continues, they cannot accept the offer. The story will continue (if they will transfer to SM's subisidiary and also sign a contract with a Japanese company)

[cashboxman's webcast of Oct 9] (cr:ebian_kei)
I will be scolded if I say the guest of Jaejoong's concert.
Concerning the videosZAK made a big problem at Hitachinaka, therefore, nobody wants to do this business, so the release schedule is unknown
Japanese songsIt is being made (does he mean JJ's solo?) If Sasahara-san can get hold of the master licence (contract), he wants to do something before Jan 26

[cashboxman's webcast of Oct 9] (cr:ebian_kei) When will the newspaper stop talking about KARA and shift to JYJIn a few days (within tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?) since there is only a little time left
I want to make this story a happy end by the middle of Nov. 
Concerning the Super Star stuff, I cannot say it aloud
Lee Soo-man's ultimate desire Not just messing around in Korea, but expand the business to the Asian countries

The Cambodian companyWill JYJ be the friendship ambassador?
The real truth of the disbandThe biggest cause was the cosmetic company. However, the salaries of the Korean entertainment companies are very cheap (airplane &amp; hotel fees are lent out by the company ) 
After the lawsuit concludes, they should receive 600 million (t/n: doesn't state the currency), however, Cjes is deliberately delaying? (to say it in short words.)

[cashboxman's webcast of Oct 9] (cr:ebian_kei) Thanks to the 3 members, the Korean contract system has changed, so the 3 members are said to be heros.
K DASH and avex is now holding hands.
It seems as Matsuura+Burning VS KDASH+Chiba? And SM is involved (vanguard??)
2 summits (t/n: should mean Matssura and Chiba), the story is really messy...

(cashboxman) JYJ is a last weapon. It's a good chance for people to focus on TOHOSHINKI's disband issue at the time, because of KARA one.

(cashboxman) The 3/JJ feel(s) uneasy because they/he think(s) fans would be leaving.

(cashboxman) The person who introduced JYJ to CJeS was Kimura Soichi-san. It's a secret why they're close. I'll tell u why JYJ joined CJeS.

(cashboxman) The truth of their disband was Cosmetics. I was surprized to see their payslips. Do you know this story very well, don't you?

(cashboxman) There would be exploding for a whole this month. Becoming a catalyst, they has changed/improved Korean Entertainment Industry.

(cashboxman) They're HEROs.

(cashboxman) the interview will be the 3's words. For the 2, I don't know it because they are in A-company.

(cashboxman) Why have JYJ been not done activities in Japan, it is that there're a few evil persons in jp industry.

(cashboxman) In Korea, it's not like that, just they are sloppy simply. Wonder if decent persons had appeared around the boys so far..

(cashboxman) There's no possibility for JYJ to move Avex Vanguard almost. Matsuura won't take them, so plan to let Chiba to do..

(cashboxman) But the persons who tried to block this, that's so troublesome, there's a possiblity to plan to let them move into SM Japan.

(cashboxman) KARA issue: Nicole's mom will make a new comapy, she moves to it. KARA invites a new member and SM will marge DSP directly.

(cashboxman) JYJ is also a last weapon for Jp Showbiz Industry. All the media knows and understand it now.

(cashboxman) Therefore, there's a time that the evil persons came closer around them.

(cr:MAKI_tokyoJapaN) Mr. Kazuki+ Mr. Sasahara (+) ""The possibility of JYJ to join (avex) vanguard is very low. Mr. Matssura is almost finished in Japan, therefore, (there are those who think) JYJ should be in the hand of Mr.Chiba...however, natually, there is a counter power trying to avoid JYJ going to Mr. Chiba. If this situation continues, in order to avoid further trouble, they may join SM's Japanese company.""

(cashboxman) fan's Q regarding XIA's dad. I'll tell you the answer wirh no cut seriously. Because fans mostly feel uneasy.

(cashboxman) fan's Q: Do the 5 make a contact now? A: They communicate each other.
I cannot say who and who, but of course they do it now.

(cashboxman) A new CEO, do you know it already if you can watch the broadcasting?^^",9,0

224,2013-10-10,2013,10,10,11,1o44ia,(Serious)Im afraid to audition. Anyone else?,[deleted],1381371682,"If this is the wrong subreddit for this then I apologize.

There are alot of us who want to become idols and start in the entertainment business. To do this you need to audition to any of the entertainment companies in korea. Before I start heres a little info about the road to being an idol if you didnt already know. 

Now me personally, JYP is the one I would choose to audition too. TECHNICALLY yes, to become an idol you dont need to be korean and good looking to be accepted, they state they will judge you based on your talent. Well im gonna tell you this...its a big fat lie. Have you seen an idol thats not good looking? No right? Nowadays, if your good looking its enough to be accepted into a company meaning looks are IMPORTANT in the industry. Now for the second part about not having to be asian. This is true but if your not asian, chances are you wont get in just because of that fact. Thats the cold hard truth. I see all these people on youtube so excited to audition, and I can only feel bad for them as they do not have the visuals to become a kpopstar and some of them are not asian. Yes I know I sound harsh and poopish, but this is the truth.

Now heres my problem. I am korean and just turned 16. I can dance well for the most part according to my instructor(korean) who trains alot of people like us who strives to become idols, and he tells me my visuals are good and not going to be a problem  based on korean standards. I know I sound like an arrogant poo poo but bear with me. I would of auditioned looonggg ago if not for one thing... I have pretty bad acne, like its really bad. I know for a fact that this would be a problem if I do pass the auditions and end up still having it even after my teen years. Im planning to see how my acne progresses throughout this year as time is running out for me and I need to choose between college and korea. I would have to hate to give up becoming an idol because of acne but if I must I will. 

Does anyone have a problem like this? Not auditioning because of a personal issue?

EDIT: Wow this subreddit has some awesome people.",28,5

Then, I walked towards the city library, and I found a crowd of people in the city hall park. Turns out that there was gonna be a free concert at 7 o'clock. I searched on naver, a search engine, and it said IU and other groups were gonna be here! I was excited! I waited about 3 hours and they allowed people to come in. I was about a hundred meters away from the stage. The concert was to celebrate multicultural families, and the concert began with videos about it. The concert had many groups and idols, but this is what I got. BTS is really really good at dancing. T-ARA is very very sexy. Everyone from Block B is really handsome and awesome. B2B is very fun. Also, IU is really pretty. Although I went alone, I had a lot of fun and I can't stop thinking about it. I love kpop and Seoul! :D",20,52

Okay, so essentially, my assignment is to poll other kpop fans about different aspects of the genre. Here are some of my questions:

1. How did you get into KPOP originally?
2. What group/artist or event really helped kpop take off, in your opinion?
3. What is your favorite thing about kpop and why?
4. Favorite artist and why?
5. How, in your opinion, is kpop doing as far as expanding into other markets aside from Korea.
6. What music genres do you think influenced kpop the most to help it become what it is today.

Any other information is appreciated. I would like to get at least three people's opinions.

Thanks /r/kpop !

EDIT: Thanks so much everyone for the feedback.  I'm sure I'll get an A on this one.  Upvotes for everyone!

440,2013-10-18,2013,10,18,6,1oo60d,What separates a good MV from a bad MV in k-pop?,dongledongs,1382044302,"For instance, there are good MVs, but then there are ones that are considered classics/will be remembered for a long time.
Take Gee for example: One could say that Gee is a classic just because of how many views it got.  But, what about it drew so many people to watch it?  Why was SHINee's Lucifer more successful than Dream Girl as a music video?

So to make it easy to discuss, let's divide this into four questions:

-What is the best k-pop MV you've seen, and why is it your favorite/why is it good?

-Was there any MV you consider to be just plain bad?  Why?

-Is it better to have a mediocre MV or a bad MV?

-What is one aspect of a k-pop MV that absolutely has to be present for it to be good?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first discussion thread I've posted here, but I hope it's a good topic to discuss because MVs are such a big deal in k-pop. There are a lot of different titles I wanted to put for this, so sorry if it came off weird.",45,36

Both also have skill in dancing and singing.

IU's latest album has shown that she has a strong sense of self and sense of wit (Modern Times as the title for an album of vintage tracks).

Their styles are very different, of course, but thats what would make a co-lab complimentary. It would have to be a slow, sultry tone, which g-dragon has shown in Butterfly and other songs.

The past several weeks, the variety show, Infinite Challenge, had singers partner up with cast members and each team tasked with making a song and performing it at the upcoming festival.

The teams are:

1. Yoo Jae Suk &amp; Yoo Hee Yeol
2. Park Myung Soo &amp; Primary
3. HaHa &amp; Jang Gi Ha and Faces
4. Gil (of LeeSsang) &amp; BoA
5. Jung Joon Ha &amp; Kim C
6. Jeong Hyun Don &amp; G-Dragon
7. Noh Hong Chul &amp; Rose Motel

My information might be wrong, but I believe they will be showing the performances next week, which you won't need a sub to watch. I just want people to know it's a pretty big event in Korea as it's one of the most watched variety show + popular singers. Expect the album to sweep the charts once it comes out next week.

SNSD Sooyoung (24) is dating Actor Jung Kyung Ho (30)

They have been together for 1 year already...

The two of them met at church, and it all started from there.

Sooyoung would listen to his radio shows while he was DJ'ing

The two would go on small dates during the very late nights.

He surprised her at one of SNSD's concerts

He also rented out an entire restaurant for her birthday.

Basically, this has already been reported on and denied late Feb.

but in late Sept Jung Kyung Ho said he was dating on his radio show - albeit, he said it was a commoner

And the concert/birthday stuff came after the initial Feb denial.

Why I think it's plagiarism

First, Electric Swing is similar. If you wish to argue against a majority of samples are used in almost every song since the genre itself is fairly new. When listening not only do the parts match up but the breaks align near perfectly in both the vocals and instrumentals. 

Is IU at fault? No, but her management and composers that were hired are DEFINITELY going to be in trouble **unless** Sony Music had already arranged a deal to use their work from Nekta's - Here's Us (2009). Yes we've had very similar incidents with other artists plagiarizing each other but this one just nails it on the head. Lyrics from the artists don't have to be the same for it to pass in court but if more than 5 bars of instrumental are similar then it's flagged.

766,2013-10-29,2013,10,29,14,1pg2e7,Looking to give a few K-pop CDs/DVDs that can go to someone that will appreciate them more.,Stevesie,1383023261,"Hello /r/kpop!

I like to go to various thrift stores, and at one of my more local goodwills, I happened across what I thought were a few K-pop CDs, and decided to pick them up as they were about .99 a piece. I'm offering them up to anyone that might like to own them and enjoy them more than I will. They are as follows:


FIN.K.L - 1999 First Live Concert (2 VCD Set)

FIN.K.L - 2000 Second Live Concert (2 VCD Set)

FIN.K.L - Fine Killing Liberty - Blue Rain (CD album)

Babyvox - Devotion (CD Album)


The VCDs are all in their cases with the booklets, and the case sleeves. The FIN.K.L CD has everything I expect from an album.  The Baby VOX CD has a case sleeve, but no booklet and no case card (the part that's behind the CD holder in the case). 

I offer these up for the cost of shipping. If you wish to throw more cash my way, I'll gladly take it as student loans suck. &gt;.&lt; I just wish to get these into the hands of those that may not be able to obtain them as easily and make sure that they get to someone that will enjoy them.

Thanks for reading. 

Edit: It looks like Zalaesso has first crack at them, within two days, unless good reason is given for a longer time needed for contact with their friend. Next up is BrigidAndair, and Thirdly, The_Other_Alex. I'll be sending PMs to the respective people, letting them know what's going on and any updates will be given in an edit such as this.
