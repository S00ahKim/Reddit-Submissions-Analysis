Usually I would think they continue to receive their share of the revenues for whatever they participated without change, **but I will ask anyway: do they?**

The way these studios are, they might manage to cut them off completely, I have no doubts they try.

If I purchase a Jessica-time SNSD album, does Jessica still get her share?

If I purchase Kara, do the members still get their share?",10,12

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Girl Groups. Nominate your favourite girl idol group songs. Try to limit yourself on solo artists that are in a girl idol group, unless they are a very iconic and noteworthy solo artist! Songs by boy groups about girls do not count!!

Feel free to ask questions to me or the nominators to see perceptions on nominated songs.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **roughly this time next week**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

These are the possible upcoming themes:

* Remixes

A final playlist week is coming up soon!

I am interested mostly in the concerts and the fan engagement events but I have work on Friday and Saturday.

1. Is it going to be possible for me to find out which groups are going to performing on which days? And also which days the fan engagement activities will be happening?

2. Has anyone purchased a platinum pass? I am foremost a fan of Seventeen, but I like BTS and Mamamoo as well, so I don't know if it might be worth it to shell out more for things like the backstage tour, etc.

3. Do they close the line for the concerts early? Like on Friday, would I be able to leave work just a little early and get there right about when the concert starts &amp; still get in? I don't want to take too much time off from work because it's going to be hard getting that Saturday off also.

I really have a bazillion questions because the KCON website provides basically no information. But I tried searching for the info about Platinum and didn't see any. ",2,7

---

[Dance/Electronic] [DDNJ - Disco Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egAKiOr7URA)

&gt; Really fun song that just makes you want to dance. I'm a huge fan of breathy/quiet vocals which don't overpower the instrumental (eg. [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), [Bonjour Suzuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSRsyqsyv4Q)), so this song was right up my alley. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Electronic] [BEARX -  (Night Shade)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKzzkY1vheI)

&gt; One of the best songs I've heard this year. It takes a full minute for the vocals to kick in and it's totally worth the wait. The chorus, while pretty simple instrumentally, gets me hyped whenever I hear it and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Folk] [Danpyunsun and the Sailors - High and Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1hAszFEuvM)

&gt; Super unique sound which I haven't heard much in Korean music. The fiddle (or violin?) player adds a really cool flavor to the song which complements the singer's vocals perfectly. Overall a really interesting song musically which everybody can appreciate on some level. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Electronic] [Sugardonut - Imagine, Close Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOFiVKnRIds)

&gt; As a YouTube commenter put it, this song is ""like a musical skydive."". The structure of this song is all about building anticipation for the booming chorus, and I have to say it's masterfully done. - /u/Nokel

[Piano/Instrumental] [Choi Youngmin -  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ0SIDruiok) 
&gt; I really think the album cover is rather fitting for the song. Listening to it does make me think of going away or traveling on a rainy day. There's also a feeling of nostalgia and something else that the music conjures when I'm listening to it. It's not catchy or very impressive but I picked it out because of its introspective quality. - /u/hewhomadetheworld

[Ballad] [Allegrow - Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaR8TpyLPU)
&gt; A very sad song. The lyrics are also interesting (subs are awkward though) and the album [description](http://www.mnet.com/album/540934) makes it even more so. The good vocals play well with the instruments and I think it helps really evoke the emotions of the listener. I'm also biased towards sad songs. - /u/hewhomadetheworld

236,2016-5-4,2016,5,4,7,4hqz3d,My relationship with K-pop.,teeaachmee,1462314617,"Hi all, 


I owe you all an apology.


I was first introduced to K-pop just over a year ago when I got into my first serious relationship, and discovered that my then-girlfriend was obsessed with it. The music, the choreography, the biasing and the fangirling... everything. At first, I thought it was a joke - I dismissed her as immature. I didn't really ""click"" with the music, because it's so radically different to what I normally involve myself with, which gave me even more reason to dismiss it.

Every day I was with her, she would load up Allkpop as part of her daily evening ritual to have a quick browse, and I would internally roll my eyes in disgust. ""Grow up,"" I thought, while staring at the countless photos of L on her walls. But, the more I dismissed it, the more I realised: it's not just about the music, the choreography, the biasing and the fangirling. K-pop, to her, meant something much more than any of those things. It was a community, just like the small circles I hide in when I go online and watch my favourite streams and YouTubers. It was a safe place for her to go to and relax and unwind, and just... have fun.


But I could not bring myself to see it that way. I just didn't like the music. I focused on that, hard. And so I pushed it further and further away, and a part of her with it. I pretended to like it but, it just didn't click. There was always a part of me that was telling me, ""no, dude, you can't like this, you're not about this whole ""image"" thing. It's immature and you're not immature, are you?"" 


And now, on this cool Tuesday evening, I decided to go back to a few songs that I decided I didn't hate (or, didn't want to admit that I enjoyed), and now I am reduced to tears. The K-pop fandom is all about being a part of a community, to have fun and unwind, to relax. And, for some, to escape reality and live in a different world - just as I used to do with my games. 


I am sorry for flat out rejecting K-pop just because I didn't ""click"" with it at first. And I'm sorry for dubbing it as immature. I regret my internal tantrums: if anything, I was the immature one, and I am sorry for painting the community at large with that brush.


I'll go back to browsing Block B, BAP, SNSD, Infinite... all the stuff that I didn't want to admit to myself, that I actually like. May even buy a few songs here and there, who knows :)

&gt; 1. [+792, -98] I hope they include her self-composed 'Bittersweet and Crazy', it's a really good song
&gt; 
&gt; 2. [+588, -89] Can't waittttttttt
&gt; 
&gt; 3. [+532, -89] That eye smile, so jealous
&gt; 
&gt; 4. [+681, -154] It's the nice people who win in the end. Nice and pretty Tiffany, I support you.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. [+452, -80] I'm not a fan but I have to admit that she's really passionate about this
&gt; 
&gt; 6. [+124, -18] She has the potential to hit daebak as long as she gets a good song. I think she'd have picked a good title track. I love hearing her English pronunciation in songs.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. [+103, -15] Her eye smile is fact
&gt; 
&gt; 8. [+112, -20] Finally it's being revealed~ I've been waiting, Fany-ya, fighting!

Source: X Sports news via Naver

&gt; 1. [+146, -40] 10 years after debut, she finally gets her own solo album. It feels so late but I wish you the best, Tiffany.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. [+150, -57] She has such a pretty eye smile, I know that she'll do well with her solo
&gt; 
&gt; 3. [+122, -40] She has a good vocal color
&gt; 
&gt; 4. [+30, -16] She's gorgeous 
&gt; 
&gt; 5. [+27, -16] Pretty teasers, and it seems the song is a dance track too

**Show Format:**

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated.

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)

I'm getting most of my information from here - http://www.kconusa.com/kcon-ny-tickets/

Is that the official/best place for info?  I'm not seeing anywhere that it says the dates for the show but I've seen on other sites it says June 24th and 25th, is that correct?

What does fan engagement hi-touch and fan engagement audience mean?  

What would 1 chance or 1 guarantee for red carpet mean?  

I'm assuming combo tickets mean both days and single ticket means admittance for just 1 of the days, is that correct?  Just want to make sure combo doesn't mean 2 people.

Finally, are these tickets expected to sell out fast?  Where is my best chance on getting tickets as soon as they go on sale? Ticketmaster?

Thanks a ton for the help! Trying to make this a special birthday for my sister but I'm totally lost...",7,0

642,2016-5-8,2016,5,8,12,4id0vs,"What is your opinion on singing, dancing, and using backing tracks/vocals in kpop?",fierce_glare,1462676962,"I have a lot of random thoughts, so I will try my best to piece them together in a way where a discussion can start.

I guess first, one of the appealing things about kpop is the entertainment value. When doing a performance, there are many things to keep a viewer interested; singing ability, dancing, clothes and costumes, aegyo, unexpected things (doing a riff or changing up the choreo).  

Recently (and I don't even know how to define recently, it's been a trend for maybe almost a decade now?!) it's pretty much standard to use a backing track with backing vocals for kpop live performances. Sometimes the backing vocals are quite minimal. 

For example, in **Taeyeon's** ""I"" performances, the backing vocals are purely there to get the song started (the first line), a few harmonizing parts, and the very end where the range is quite low and she might have trouble projecting her voice loudly.

On the other side of the spectrum (please, PLEASE do not hate me, I am a HUGE fan of this group...) we have **Twice's** new single ""Cheer up"". I honestly cannot hear some members voices over the backing track, especially Mina and Momo. I can't even hear Jihyo half the time and she is known for being able to belt out notes. Both Jihyo and Mina can absolutely sing, but the backing track vocals are either too loud, OR, they are not singing as loudly as they can, letting the backing vocals kind of come in a mix with their live voice, making a fuller sound for the sake of the performance.

Some kpop groups have insanely tough dances. Some people argue that these groups should get a pass for lip syncing to a backing track, because they are giving their all with the choreo. Personally, while I don't exactly agree with this, I think it's actually ""cool"" and ""impressive"" to hear a singer who's dancing so hard, to ""run out of breath"" while singing... I dunno how to explain it, it's like... damn, that artist is really giving their all!!!

Lastly, I have two random side notes. They have to do with jpop.

1) Perfume. They sing with 100% backing track and often don't even have their mics on while performing. I am surprisingly okay with this because I really like Yasutaka Nakata (their producer)'s style, as well as the way their voices sound computerized. They also dance very complex routines which are fun to watch, so I kind of give them a pass on not performing live.

2) I don't have a youtube link, but last week I was watching TV here in Japan and an artist called Miura Daichi performed his new song ""Cry &amp; Fight"" on Music Station. He freaking **killed it**. Seriously, the opening of his performance was him belting out the chorus, **ACAPELLA**, while dancing his choreo. His breathing was on point. He performance was absolutely amazing. It's artists like him (as well as often cited examples like Beyonce) who I watch and think ""You know what, maybe I shouldn't be giving so much of a pass to artist/groups who heavily rely on backing tracks/vocals for all their live performances.""

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention one of my other big points: Pre-recorded live singing.

I posted this below but I'll add it in here, ""...when they pre-record a live version of a song (complete with audible breathing, slightly different riffs from the CD version) and then lip sync to this during a life performance, passing it off as if they are actually singing.""",111,33

I mean, he's currently the director of the most successful Kpop company in Korea so I'm guessing he's not interested or he's a lot busier now. Shinhwa and g.o.d had multiple comebacks and Sech Kies just had a reunion concert through Infinite Challenge so I at least want to see H.O.T on stage one more time.

This year, I might be going to Kcon in Paris, this is the first time I'll ever be to a kpop event since this is the first time one has ever been organized at a time and place where i can actually go. But I've never been to K-con or other similar events before (never been to a concert either!). So I've been wondering, what have your experiences been in these types of events in general, and more specifically KCON in other cities? 

I'll hope i'll have a good time, but considering entry price and HallyuNorth I am a bit worried haha, I wonder if i should really go anyway. 

P.S: I understand HallyuNorth is a whole new thing while KCON has more experience but I still think it's valid concerns as a first-time goer to a kpop event.

P.S2: Sorry for potentially poor english, obviously not a native speaker :p",9,1

680,2016-5-8,2016,5,8,23,4ieoq4,Favorite B-sides that nobody seems to mention?,NoSchittSherlockSEA,1462716855,"Title. Generally B-sides are either generic or saved by the charisma + execution of each group, or are just plain awesome. Any favorite and not-really-talked about B-sides and why?

I'll just give my list here:

[Nobody But You: Block B-Bastarz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ell7q83gQks): The entire Bastarz album is criminally overlooked by many, but this one is the definite gem of the lot. The quintessential sex jam of the album, this song is sultry and not too in-your-face. B-Bomb's fragile vocals and U-kwon's strong nasal vocals do wonders together, and yes, that is P.O. speaking Spanish in the very beginning. I wish they had promoted this instead.

[Love Dust: BIGBANG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wmls6XU8qs): Such an underrated song, and one where Seungri's parts are the highlight throughout the entire song. Always a plus. And if you know how many times GD had Seungri redo his parts to get it just right...

[Mental Breaker: Block B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th5qwsT0ano): LALALALALALALALALA~ This is THE summer Jam, something I'd blast in a beach party, doing the [shoulder dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0k0fW1JivU) and drinking liters of cucumber water.

[Baepsae: BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgiEKJ5VRdA): Any ARMY will know this is in no way a B-side nobody mentions much. BUT STILL. The Highlight of the HYYH Pt 2 for many, this is a dash of the BTS of the earlier years, and an absolutely catchy track with social commentary to boot.

[Spine Breaker: BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CRNWJbyJMI): the song that made me a fan of BTS. From the rap and biting social commentary to V'S HOLY CRAP Baritone, it's unfortunate such a gem is buried in BTS's discography.

[GG Be: Seungri ft. Jennie Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAOu52JC3zU): Ladies and Gentlemen, the inimitable Sass Lord Seungri. What makes the lyrics even funnier is the fact that it's based on his past love life. And Jennie Kim's clear vocal color contrasts nicely with Seungri's soft vocals.

[Love Letter: VIXX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvObxWXoJ0w): Let me tell y'all a story about how I became a starlight. I first searched up VIXX  in detail after Bobbygate and along the way became acquainted with the members, becoming vaguely disturbed with Ravi's Rap with each MV I went through, and then this song. THIS SONG. Ravi Singing. That one member I mistook for a girl in vocal color (LEO). And from that day on, STARLIGHT.

[FXXK wit Us: Lee Hi ft Dok2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JP89972-R0): I can't be the only one reeling that YG approved of this song being released. I'm not the biggest Dok2 fan, but there's something pleasing about Lee Hi singing ""All I need is you, baby fuck the world.""

That's it for now! Any B-sides you'd recommend that you feel deserve more attention and WHY?",119,58

So I went to the concert because it happened to fall on days I was backpacking in Seoul; how could I not? I did meet up with a few international Armys that'd flown over for the concert and we all hung out.

**DAY 1** 

I bought a ticket for Day 1 online via Interpark and it was in standing area A. But it was pretty shitty, because I was near the front and got squished a lot. And I'd been carrying a paper bag with albums, my wifi router, phone, an Army bomb and a program booklet, but because of the pushing around, the bag broke. I left the area because I couldn't handle it and lost everything except the phone; afterward, I only found my wifi router and everything else had been stolen. (Still lowkey pissed about the program booklet.) 

The pushing was really, really bad; people were fainting and I was a good few inches taller than all the other girls with a good view and I still wasn't okay with taking it. People were shouting in Korean and I was swearing in English, and my friend says J-Hope looked over at what was happening and just sorta... angled his head away uncomfortably. We ended up being lifted over the barrier by a security guard and went to the first aid area for a few songs (House of Cards, Love is Not Over all the way till Save Me). There were already quite a few people there.

We went back in when Save Me started and the angle wasn't good but it was a lot less cramped nearer the back. (People squeeze near the front and also the perimeter of the area? Because of the extended stage.) And everything is kinda a blur until Hip Hop Lover when the boys didn't have to do choreo any more and they just kinda ran around the stadium on the stage. Since everyone kept to the perimeter to follow the boys, there was this sizeable circle around us and me, with my lack of an Army bomb, was just jamming there; Jeongguk came near, likely saw the Giant Hole in Pit, made eye contact and started dancing. So that was fun. 

Don't remember much else from Day 1 except Cypher Pt.3 live is absolutely amazing. A lot of stuff you don't see on the DVDs as well, like how the boys interact with the backup dancers a lot. We left again halfway through their ending ment because the area was too cramped, so I missed the Jeongguk crying part.

**DAY 2**

I really didn't wanna leave on a bad note, so I reached the area at around 9am to try and queue for a ticket at the ticket box. The booth opened at 12pm but there was already a huge line formed in the park area, of all places, and people had set up mats and stools and everything. There were still quite a few tickets left because they didn't release all; not the best tickets, I ended up right in the most corner of corners, but I was in the fourth row and pretty close to the extended stage. [This was my view.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ch6gqecVAAAjFR2.jpg) Ended up queuing for about four to five hours? But I made friends in the line so it was pretty worth it.

Sort of knew what to expect already, but the angle really was bad and I couldn't catch some of the songs, especially those where they stood near the back of the stage e.g. Dead Leaves. Jimin came up really close during House of Cards, though, his mic stand really was just *there*. When the boys ran around they'd wave at us a lot, and like the day before they interacted a lot with the backup dancers. (The backup dancers looked like they were having lots of fun too, just freestyling whenever there wasn't choreo.) 

During Whalien 52, Taehyung started to tear up and he had to sing with his head hanging down. (Jimin teased him after that.) Young Forever was one of my favourites, it was super anthem-like; you could barely hear the boys' voices over all the fans', and it was gorgeous. 

In Miss Right, like the day before, they carried around little woven baskets with plastic balls in them and threw them to fans; some of them (Jin, I think? And Jimin and Taehyung.) kissed the balls before throwing them and holy shit did fans fight over those. On Day 1 we saw a really young girl with red eyes and one shoe and dirty socks sitting outside the corridor, and the guard said something to her and gave her two signed balls; I think she probably fought for them, *hard*. Anyway. On Day 2 I saw Seokjin kiss a bunch and throw them into the standing pit and, I swear, a five-meter radius circle opened up and it was terrifying. 

J-Hope also threw his water bottle into the crowd during Cypher Pt.3. Someone threw a towel into the crowd. Jeongguk and someone else (Seokjin, I think?) threw their caps into the crowd as well. At some point Jimin went down into the crowd to do something?? but not sure what. And I made eye contact with them (or tried to...) whenever they came near so that was fun. 

I Need U during the encore was really nice. They started off with a really short Urban Mix version where they basically did not sing at all; it was just the Armys singing the whole thing and you could see their faces on the giant screens and it was pretty emotional, not gonna lie. Then they ended off with the full, original version of INU. 

During the ending ment, Jimin thanked the members by name and sang a little song and cried, and this made the other members tear up too. And when they were going around the stadium thanking the fans, Yoongi did a deep bow, knees to the ground and head pressed to the floor, and just stayed there sobbing; Jimin went up to comfort him.

I also headed to the back of the gymnasium afterward to catch a glimpse of them and when they came out, most went straight to the car but Taehyung walked in a circle and waved at us for quite a while, and so did Jeongguk. [When the car drove away Jeongguk stuck his head out of the sunroof and Taehyung stuck his out the window.](https://twitter.com/V_kun1230/status/729285974857900032) There were a LOT of people waiting, some even drove their cars up to the barricade and sat on the roof. 

**A few notes**

* My Army bomb for Day 2 (a new one) had no batteries so I was kinda... silently jamming and standing up whenever they got near and dancing, so I probably looked a little out of place amidst all the other steadily bobbing bombs.

* The crowds are crazy, lots of international fans and quite a few fan boys as well. Fan clubs give away lots of free stuff before the concert but be prepared to queue.

* There were guys walking around in hoodies and masks of the boys (printed pictures, laminated, rubber bands around ears and all) and you could take photos with them, and they gave you free stickers too.

* Merchandise didn't run out super fast but program booklets definitely did. (Still pissed I lost mine.)

* They really start everything on the dot. Ticket box, concert, everything.

* A lot of fans are really, really young. Like elementary school young or even smaller. There was a little girl seated behind me with her mother on Day 2 and her mum just sat the entire time, but when she stood up to do the Army bomb thing she was only a couple of inches taller than the chair. 

* The boys look just as good in real life as they do on your computer screen, in photos, in videos etc. They look the same. Yoongi and Jimin look especially small, but all of them are pretty thin/lean. Yes, Jimin's booty and Jeongguk's thighs are just as they look in photos.

* My bias is (probably) Jeongguk so I pretty much kept my eyes glued to him the whole time, but Namjoon looks a lot more charismatic? attractive? in real life than he does in photos, and Yoongi in a white cap is very dangerous.

* I don't know how they do it, but they perform incredibly well. Everyone has great stage presence and their live singing is amazing considering the choreo that they're doing; they were really tired after Fire and Dope, definitely. Save Me looked intense too; that choreo is really, really nice.

* I couldn't understand a lot of the stuff they were saying because it was all in Korean, but it was pretty emotional and lots of people around me started crying, mostly during the ending ment. The boys bowed really deep at the end as well.

* Knowing the fan chants is good, but personally I liked singing the whole song with them, even if my throat was super sore afterward. It's definitely worth it to know what are the chants though, especially those moments where everyone is just singing/chanting together.

* Seating tickets are much better than standing. But if you want to try braving the bloodbath... go for it. I know some people who had a good time. 

* In the VCRs there were new tracks; pretty sure one was some kinda remix of INU, another was the one they used in the Epilogue teaser, and there was one more. They all sound amazing. 

* The boys really like to do the thing where they let the audience sing the lines, especially rap line.

**TL;DR** BTS is super attractive in real life, they can dance and sing and rap really well, great stage presence, amazing concert, potential river of tears, mini-dance party with Jeongguk, eye contact with the rest.   

I think that's it! Most of the stuff that happened has probably been posted on twitter somewhere or on the compilation thread that's right on /r/bangtan, so I'm probably missing a lot, especially since I can't speak Korean very well. Hope this has been thorough enough! Will edit if I suddenly remember something. ",18,74

794,2016-5-10,2016,5,10,2,4iklwc,"Jombly, the K-Pop visual radio app, has received a massive update with tons of new features and bugfixes! Free, no ads, unlimited skips, songlist updated in real-time from Korean charts. Works on any device.",JomDarbert,1462814522,"Hello /r/kpop!

About a year ago, [Jombly](http://www.jombly.com) was launched on /r/kpop as a side-project of mine to help find new K-Pop music. Thanks to this community's awesome support, it grew into something pretty big! For those unfamiliar with the app, Jombly is a K-Pop radio app focused on content discovery. Jombly collects the top songs in real-time from Korean [charts](http://www.melon.com/chart/), finds each song's music video (along with lots of other information), and serves it up to you. The app has unlimited skips, no ads, works on any device and doesn't make me a dime - I made this strictly to give back to the community.

Jombly started with just a handful of users, but has grown to have tens of thousands of daily visitors. As of today, [Jombly 2](http://www.jombly.com) is officially live! I know that Jombly had plenty of issues in the past, but I've spent a year squashing bugs and implementing features and think you'll be really pleased to see how far things have come. Go ahead and give it a try! I'm still doing a bit of polish and tweaking, but would love to hear your feedback.

*Note: If you're still seeing Jombly 1.0, clear your browser cache and reload.*

Bug reports and feature requests always welcome at /r/jombly

-----------

**New features**

* Completely revamped UI

* Vastly improved video selection algorithms - the best video is selected 99% of the time. This is especially noticeable when a song's MV is not available

* Songs are updated in real-time! The moment the Korean charts change, Jombly knows about it and updates

* Far more information about a song available - release date, album, current/past chart rankings, artist genre and gender information, etc.

* Can install as an app locally on mobile devices (select ""Add to Home Screen"" from browser)

* Shuffle songs, or play in list order

* Filter the playlist to have only the songs you want - new songs, fast rising songs, only certain genres, only female groups -- the list goes on!

* Choose your aspect ratio - fill your screen, or view the entire video

* Save your song preferences across devices and browsers

* View the most popular tweets about a song

* Open a song directly in Apple Music

**TL;DR**
[Jombly](http://www.jombly.com) is a visual radio app I made to help the K-Pop community find and interact with new music as it's released in Korea. It gathers popular music from Korean charts and collects videos for those songs. It just received a huge update that fixed lots of bugs and implemented new features. Have a look and let me know what you think! :)",152,678

I've never made a subreddit before, so if anybody who is competent at such things would be willing to help make it look better by creating a banner and doing other code-y things, like designing link flairs to look like [these ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/), then that would be super appreciated!

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

I'm pretty damn sure almost all music shows upload the different comeback or debut videos within minutes. Some were even uploaded comparable to the timing by other users, and needless to say, of better quality.  
  
Hence, shouldn't we have a rule to upload performance videos from the official source instead? This too will benefit the artistes in getting their views score when you view their performance from the official source.

1437,2016-5-16,2016,5,16,2,4jgyuw,[Discussion] The concept of PAK (Critical thinkers only),quarkleptonboson,1463332125,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Okay so I've been very pissed off recently due to receiving undeserved downvotes. Let's talk logically here. If you're gonna come here with fan prejudices and false generalizations, get out. I'm not here to preach, I'm hear to present what I know, what I believe based on logical reasoning, and *to learn from what more informed people have to say.* 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Let's get the facts straight first. [Here is a detailed explanation of all-kills, certified AKs, and perfect AKs.](http://onehallyu.com/topic/101390-all-kill-perfect-all-kill-rooftoop-hit-5-minute-chart/) Basically, **one PAK hit equates to being #1 on all daily, weekly and realtime charts.** Since the realtime charts update every hour, an artist can score a PAK once every hour. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Alright, so what am I trying to say now? Well, I'm just a bit annoyed because fans keep overhyping PAKs. So what if an artist gets a PAK? It's too ephemeral. It doesn't say at all how much an artist will sell in the long run. *At best, a PAK only indicates an artists' current popularity.* The best indicator of how successful an album/single is is its longevity in the charts. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My observation in this subreddit is that fans seem to equate achieving a PAK to an album/single becoming super successful and that sales are going insanely well. Uhm, no. PAK is just a 1 hour-only state. Consider this **hypothetical** (absolutely no reference to any particular artist) situation:

* Week 1: Artist A (a 2nd tier idol group) makes a comeback. PAK! yaaayy!!! much higher sales, streaming, etc than last album/single

* Week 2: Artist B (non-idol but a very popular singer) makes a comeback. No PAK. But sales are really really good. Artist A's ranking in charts declines. No more PAK, but sales still good. 

* Week 3: Artist C (a 1st tier idol group) makes a comeback. PAKs all around. Sales domination. Artist A is a bit forgotten, relegated to a lower rank in charts. Artist B still doing good, but goes under the radar.

* End of the year: Ranking in terms of sales: Artist C &gt; B &gt; A


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is my point? Again, a PAK is only an indicator of real-time popularity. In no way does it indicate that an artist will do well in the long run. That is what I meant when I said that the number of PAKs has no mathematical correlation to sales. An artist can score a PAK, then right after fall down in the rankings hard. Another way of thinking about it is that an artist can get a PAK at a time when their competitors are relatively weak. Then that PAK isn't as statistically significant as the PAK of an artist who made a comeback at a time of high competition. One good indicator of success is longevity in the charts. Another indicator is the quarterly sales number (as pointed out by someone below).


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Why don't Kpop journalists in korea start using the proper analytics? I mean the ones similar to what Billboard analysts use, but tailored for the Korean music industry. They keep reporting AK/CAK/PAK but it's quite hard to find, on a regular basis, real good analytics that truly reveal statistical trends. In the end, fans hold the banner of PAKs proudly because those are the facts that are easy to find. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm not gonna pretend I'm an expert though. I don't live in korea, and I'm still building my vocabulary so I can't read korean articles. Is there anyone here who can give a more informed insight into this matter?


**TL;DR: PAKs are a misleading way of judging an artists' success in sales. There are better analytics. Why the hype?**


PS: I'd like to add one more thing though. Regarding Twice's achievement of scoring a PAK around 20 days after release, I kind of downplayed it when I commented because I was bitter that BTS still won on their comeback week. I admit I was blinded by the sodium lol. The fact that they still achieved a PAK so many days after release does say a lot about the longevity of their songs in the charts. This I didn't see immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So yeah, what we can takeaway from it is this: documenting PAKs can become useful at rare times like this when an artist scores a PAK so many days after release. But this almost never happens so it won't be helpful at all to most artists. I still stand by my opinion that Kpop needs better analytics. ",57,0
1438,2016-5-16,2016,5,16,2,4jgzcs,FNC appear to have placed AOA's new mv 'Good Luck' on private on their YouTube channel and have deleted the tweet of the MV on their official account,seulgitho,1463332317,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBJCSzwA5o4 &amp;lt;-- video now private. I think its still up on 1theK though. They probably have a little less control over that one and its likely to also be taken down if there's a serious mistake.

Some people are speculating why and this picture seems to be floating around a lot (nsfw??) http://imgur.com/ImZ7thX

She's the third member to debut from SNSD, and soon, Taeyeon, Tiffany &amp; Jessica will occupy the spots of the **1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd** bestselling first weeks for female solo albums on Hanteo, beating the likes of IU &amp; BoA. Taeyeon's full album will likely add to that ranking when she releases.

This is an achievement for the group (OT9) and a testament to its success as a whole, not just to them as individuals. Your opinion?",32,0

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Solo Artists. A small recommendation by /u/hoviazshi to include solo artists was made in the last thread which I was planning to do! Hopefully you didn't nominate too many solo artists in the group threads, as here is where they shine.

Feel free to ask questions to me or the nominators to see perceptions on nominated songs.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **roughly this time next week**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

Remixes and the final playlist are inbound.

Jonghyun 1st full album will release on the 24th

next will be EXO comeback in june (most likely during the first half)

then it is likely follow by Luna some time after EXO in june (most likely the second half of june)

what i'm curious about is who do you think is going to be the next comeback or debut after Luna?
 
(i really hope it will be Red Velvet with a second full/third mini/repackage that will release on July 7th)

(Taeyeon was suppose to comeback in may or april but i don't that going to happen anymore so she is another candidate for the release after Luna)

Dear fans and supporters,

Hello, this is DRMusic, Rania's management company.
Let us first express our regret over the delays in releasing Rania's 5th anniversary album.

Due to internal issues within the Rania team, and subsequent lack of preparation, we have decided to first release a Hip-hop album (Hyemi&amp;Alexandra unit), followed by a release of a full team album in the month of August.

We would like to sincerely apologize to all the fans who have supported our project at Makestar.
Your help and support has greatly helped in going forward with the album production.

The rewards associated with the Rania mini-album project at Makestar
will proceed along with the album planned for August.

All members are fully committed in preparing the rewards,
along with the new Rania album release in August.
We would like to thank each and every one for the continued support.

DRMusic &amp; Rania

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

1803,2016-5-19,2016,5,19,15,4k18mw,2PM Chansung speaks out about the Gangnam Station Homicide,brianabird,1463640614,"Context: On May 17th, a man stabbed a woman repeatedly in a bathroom. [Korean Herald: Murder suspect admits he is misogynist](http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160518000866#jyk)

&gt;1. What should I say.. That's really low. Would he have done that if it had been a male? The fuse that lit up the motive leading to his action was the fact she was a woman. It was a choice, not an accident. If he could bitterly feel what kind of result his choice has brought upon.. ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/2PMagreement211/status/733146001498742784))

&gt;2. What's more, albeit this incident also boils down to his individual problems, I think it puts our society problems on display, too. I think there are people like that among us, and they naturally blend in. ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/2PMagreement211/status/733146128749723648))

He also retweeted another person's tweet.

&gt;[Chansung's RT] @TYPE4GRAPHIC: The words ""I was belittled by women"" seemed like ""I was belittled even by women"" to me. He says he was belittled, but, the truth is, he was also doing that, and he simply couldn't stand it coming from women. It says he hated them, but in reality he discriminated against them.

1887,2016-5-20,2016,5,20,14,4k6svq,SM Entertainment audition experience.,Yeicheu,1463722491,"February 2016 I went to the New York global audition for SM Entertainment. My name is Stephen, pictures of what I look like instagram.com/yeicheu. I am half Vietnamese, half white. 22 years old. I always dreamed of being a kpopstar since I saw my first MV of Shinees ""ring ding dong"", then my favorite group became 2PM, lover of the rapper roles.
I went to the audition, not looking my best, I was in the perfect relationship and was afraid of being picked, so I didn't dress well or do my hair. I bombed my audition, and 3 months later was dumped, so FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS, DON'T GET BLINDED BY LOVE!! 
OK~ so, New York SM audition.
arrive at the venue, it was a hotel, very long line. Lots of asians, but way more non-asians. You are soon given a number, then seated in a room and given a sheet of paper asking what your applying for, you may only pick one.
 singer
 dancer
 model
 actor
I am not super confident in my dancing, my singing isn't awesome because of my deep voice, so I picked model. I was told models were to do 9 poses. 3 poses, walk forward, 3 poses, walk back, 3 poses.
the waiting room had a big projector screen playing SM music videos. 2 hours later, my group of 10 was taken into a room, singers sang first, then dancers, then models, then actors. 
It came my turn, and I did my poses, they played some elegant piano music. I finished my 9 poses, but they didn't stop the music. we were not allowed to look at the judges, but I glanced up and the judges were giving me the hand motion to do more. I did 6 additional poses.
The SM people told us we would all be contacted by email if we were picked or not. I never got an email, but the additional poses seemed to be a good sign. I'm confident if I didn't try to bomb my audition, I may have had a better chance. 
Moral is.... follow your dreams, try your best for everything, because you never know what good could come of it in the long run. 
If you have any questions I'll answer them the best I can.",9,3

They are currently doing a series of live streams called ""Sonamoo over Flowers"" where they initially used it as a platform to talk about each member and their hobbies.  And now they are extending it with live streams where they talk about what they have been up to and other things.  

In [yesterday's live stream](http://www.vlive.tv/video/8565/%EA%BD%83%EB%B3%B4%EB%8B%A4%EC%86%8C%EB%82%98%EB%AC%B4%EB%B9%84%EB%B0%80%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8%EC%96%B4%ED%83%9D), Sumin, the leader of Sonamoo, was asked the following question:  ""When will you comeback?"".  She replied back with ""Soon""!  You can watch the live stream [here](http://www.vlive.tv/video/8565/%EA%BD%83%EB%B3%B4%EB%8B%A4%EC%86%8C%EB%82%98%EB%AC%B4%EB%B9%84%EB%B0%80%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8%EC%96%B4%ED%83%9D).  Comeback question starts at 26:05.  Do note that she also gave viewers a comeback hint.  The hint was just a ""thumbs up"" though.  In any case, they have already hinted at a comeback earlier this year when they did that Twitter Mention Party, so this wasn't much of a surprise.  Even in their past streams they would talk about how they are currently practicing hard to see their fans again.  I believe this was the first time they gave out a comeback hint, however.  

I'm excite.  

&gt; **UPDATE:** In [Nahyun's solo live stream](http://www.vlive.tv/video/8289/%EA%BD%83%EB%B3%B4%EB%8B%A4%EC%86%8C%EB%82%98%EB%AC%B4%EB%B0%94%EB%9E%8C%EB%B6%80%EB%82%98%ED%98%84) she was also asked about their comeback and her reply was ""I guess it will be on June"".  The part where she talks about the comeback starts at 7:18.  Thanks to /u/Nymeros for pointing that out.  ",17,80

I truly am saddened when groups I have been following practically ever since their debut loose members. I feel like I only have past YouTube videos of when these groups were truly in their prime to look back upon.

*Sigh* Jia just left Miss A and honestly I blame JYP for solely focusing on Suzy and putting the other members on the back burner. Also Minzy leaving 2ne1 earlier this year. Not to mention the other previous idols who've left left their respected groups in the previous years.

I suppose like everything else K-pop is evolving and new groups are debuting more and more frequently. I can't even keep up, hell I just discovered the V Live app a few days ago.",24,0

Personally after being a little beaten up after the horrible hallyu north shinee concert, but this was the polar opposite. Even though Gfriend doesn't even have that many songs out they preformed a bunch of songs, I can't even list them all. They even prepared some songs just for this concert. The fanservice they gave was great and you were able to see them super close up as the theatre was really nice and small.  Overall 10/10 experience from me, highlight was definitely getting to touch eunha's hand. What did you guys think?",34,43

2060,2016-5-22,2016,5,22,22,4kii6c,"Fan account of Key's ""Save The Green Planet"" play",ladauphine,1463922914,"Warning:**Extremely** long winded. Shawol Syndrome abounds (looking at my fellow verbose Shawols /u/alfredfjones and /u/monodramas).

I wrote this for /u/zbzbzbz since she requested it. I marked the spoilerific part for you! But I also wrote it to kind of solidify my memory of the play. I 

So I finally saw ""Save the Green Planet/ "" Today. Twice actually, 3 and 6 pm showings. In essentially the same seat, just one row forward a tiny bit more central the second time. I'm sure the cast were a little perplexed. 

So yeah. This is the fourth of Key's theater productions that I've seen and it is without a doubt the best one so far. 

Zorro was great. Super fun for a fresh off the boat foreign fan with little to no Korean abilities. Lots of action and body gags as well as fun songs with a familiar story. And the set was insane. One of those giant spinning types and there was a nearly life size train car they fought on top of. 

Chess was... Well Chess was Key proving he could do more than just action roles. That he could be nuanced. I fell asleep both times I saw Chess whenever Key was not in a scene. It was boring to say the least. But Key killed his performance as the stoic chess grandmaster Anatoly. Also the most surreal moment of my life was during this play when Key is belting out this fucking insane note and suddenly a massive (like entire stage covering at the Sejong Center) Soviet Russian flag drops behind him for the last few seconds.

In the Heights was so much fun. Really upbeat story and Key was a perfect Usnavi. All of the raps were awesome sounding, the rest of the cast were really good and it was really weird to listen to the cast switch from Korean to English to Spanish all the time. Also in that play the grandmother figure dies and this musical ran just after Key had lost his own grandmother so emotions ran VERY high during that scene. There was also this great character named Sonny whose actor quickly discovered that he adores Shawols and would try to work little bits of View into his dancing if he could. 

Then there is Save the Green Planet. Key's first actual play, instead of musicals. Apparently it's very rare for idols to act in plays here, but I hope that Key will continue to get roles like this because it was amazing. 

I thought the In The Heights theater was small... Haha no. STGP theater is freaking intimate. When it was bright on stage I have no doubts the actors could see us all perfectly. The front rows could probably see up Sooni's skirt if they cared to look it's so close and tight. 

In addition to a small venue the cast was trimmed to just four actors. 

Key as Lee Byeonggu 

Kim Dobin as Kang Manshik 

Kim Yoonji as Sooni 

Yook Hyunwook as literally every other character, circus master, all the detectives, Byeonggu's father teacher and boss. He also played Sonny in ""In The Heights"" and I will refer to him as Sonny for the rest of the account. 

And they all killed their roles. And none of these were easy roles. Sooni seemed to have Downs Syndrome. Kang Manshik is an entitled but hilarious asshole. Yook Hyunwook had like a million lines and had to make all of his characters seem different.

And then Kibum. Key played a high functioning autistic character. And he did it so well, it was so believable. All of the little facial ticks, the body motions, even his way of sitting captured this characters disability perfectly. It was gut wrenching to watch the scenes where Kang Manshik was taunting Byeonggu because of how agitated and uncomfortable Key was acting. He would use the back of his hand to wipe at his face and sit cross-legged with his knees pulled close to his chest and would squint his eyes and scrunch his nose and he would smack his ears when Manshik yelled too loudly. I know these things don't cover all of autism and I acknowledge that I honestly don't know much about it, but from what I've seen in my life, especially teaching an autistic student, it seemed very well done. Not too much, but enough to give the audience a deeper impression of the character. 

**Spoilers ahead for those interested in the movie (which I highly recommend)** 

The play starts of with Sonny coming out as different shitty people. An obnoxious young man, an asshole religious fundie, a crooked businessman and Byeonggu coming out again and again looking all cool and shooting them in what is clearly a fantasy for Byeonggu. After he dispatches all of his enemies Key walked to the front of the stage and said the name of the play and pointed the gun into the audience and ""shot"". This is one of the few times he fell out of character cause you could see his shit eating grin when we all gasped.

The play starts with drunken Kang Manshik being a dick to his taxi driver. The CEO of his company, he is very wealthy and very much a little fuck. When the driver ran off stage, Byeonggu and Sooni ran out. 

Their characters are ridiculous. They are[ dressed strangely](http://40.media.tumblr.com/c2465b193f0e61c84dc52f5ef5ec9b9b/tumblr_o5671fNr1h1u0hmszo2_540.jpg) and are running and jumping around all over this tiny simple stage before knocking Manshik out and dragging him off stage.

This production was on a really simple stage with very few props. A torture trolley, a weird wheelchair for the captive Manshik to sit in and a few stools. To set the different scenes the theater used a projector on the back wall. 

Most of the first part of the play is[ Byeonggu torturing Manshik](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jgI6ZJR3fuY/hqdefault.jpg) with insect repellent, sandpaper, and electric shocks. Manshik eventually starts to show his true character though, which is oddly quite comedic. This actor was really irreverent and brought the more mocking persona to the character than the actor in the movie did. 

These are the scenes where he would shout and shout at Byeonggu, reducing him to a quivering mess or just sending him into a rampage or slamming shit into the walls and on the floor. 

These were also the scenes where Byeonggu would try and get alien information out of Manshik. Omg Key would speak SO FAST during these little monologues, it was impossible to keep up for the most part. Though this was the part where he told Manshik that he knew that he was actually and alien prince and that Byeonggu knew Manshiks real name. The best I can give you is that it sounded like a retching noise plus a cute little nasaly sound at the end. So... waaaooo-waoooo-gyoo. With little air quotes around the ""gyoo"" it was really cute and funny.

Aroung this point, Byeonggu leaves his house and encounters a total dickwad he went to school with. This character is played by Sonny and he came up to Key by dancing the View dance before trying to steal his money and generally be an ass. He also walked of the stage singing a version of Replay. He really knows his audience.

Easily the most powerful scene in the play was the flashbacks into Byeonggu's life. The circus where he first met his girlfriend Sooni (they're boyfriend and girlfriend but it is made clear that it is not a sexual relationship given certain word usage), then getting the shit beaten out of him by his abusive father, being taunted by his asshole teacher and getting beaten by him as well (corporal punishment is still a thing in Korea, especially in all boys schools), then being mocked and degraded by his boss. It was really really difficult to watch.

Then it goes back to Byeonggu in his basement with Manshik. And he starts talking about his mother, the only person that ever believed in him or encouraged him, or well just didnt treat him like shit. He is crying and crying and crying then suddenly Key just sat up with a serene smile on his face and said ""Its okay. Mom wouldn't want me to be sad, so I won't be anymore"". Then its back to normal.

All the while Sooni has ran away cause of some of Manshiks cruel words and the detectives are closing in on Byeonggu (obviously they are looking for the wealthy CEO).

Because this stage was so small, whenever they had to change things around one or two of the actors would just dance around the stage in a silly fashion. Or Sonny would come out. First time he comes out in nothing but tights and proceeds to put on sweatpants without using his hands and then he takes his hat and asks for donations to the circus from the crowd. The second time I saw it today some girls put some strange big boxes into his hat. He was perplexed but continued on. Later in the play he was doing the entertaining thing while the others changed and he showed us what they had given him.

The girls had given him Bushyeo Bushyeo Ramen. And jesus christ did he beat that like a dead horse the rest of the play. It was hilarious. When his detective characters were on the phone he would find a way to work Bushyeo into his lines. It was great.

So the play finally starts to hit its real climax. Byeonggu decides to crucify Manshik and then as he is about to torture him more, Manshik decides to tell Byeonggu that he knows how to save Byeonggu's mother.

So through all of this, Byeonggu has been stealing Manshiks money to pay for his mother on life support at the local hospital. Manshik owned the factory that Byeonggu and his mom worked at before an accident nearly killed her (and the company refused to help with her care). This convinced Byeonggu of Manshik's alien status and is thus why he eventually kidnapped him.

So Manshik essentially tells him that to save his mom he has to use this like alien incantation. And I shit you not, the alien incantation is just a oddly high and strained sounding version of Ring Ding Dong plus a really loud bark or two at the end. 

So he teaches this to Byeonggu who runs off to the hospital and is leaning over his mother (which is actually a part of the wall that just came down and had a mirror on it, so Key was just acting looking at his own reflection) saying this incantation thing over and over again. His mother dies (in the movie there was a liquid it wasn't in the play as far as I could tell) as he is singing high pitched barking Ring Ding Dong and he is like sobbing with despair while singing this and it was really awful to watch. Cause on one level its funny, but on another its soul destroying. This was a common feeling in this play.

 After that Detectives discover Byeonggu and he kills them while Manshik is crucified behind him. Sooni returns. And they go off driving to the coastal factory as that would be the best night for Manshik to contact his alien mother ship.

When they arrive, Manshik explains all about the aliens contact with Earth. How they originally came when the (sentient?)dinosaurs were here, and how they are vaguely responsible for their extintion. Then how they watched as humanity took over and how the aliens are watching earth to see if it is worth keeping. How they are doing trials on certain humans, such as Byeonggu's mother. 

Suddenly all hell breaks loose and Manshik ends up shooting Sooni. This was another one of those hilarious/awful moments. Key is bent over Sooni's face crying into her neck after she dies, while Manshik is at her feet trying to keep her legs closed but they keep falling open so he finally just crosses her feet at her ankles. 

Manshik and Byeonggu end up fighting again and just as Byeonggu is about to detonate the bomb vest he's had on since they left his house, Manshik shoots and kills him. There are voice over reports of how the CEO was found and the madman was killed.

Suddenly Sonny walks out in a shiny green robe. Now he is the alien secretary. First he does the Lucifer dance and points to the first movable wall part and it comes down... then he walks a few steps, does a bit of View (Everybody in the second play) and the second wall part comes down, then he Sherlocks his way over and does a bit more of the Sherlock dance (Ring Ding Dong in the second one) to call open the third wall bit. 

Then fucking Kang Manshik in the most ridiculous white and gold flowy ladies jumpsit and little kid crown floats his ass out and they have AN ENTIRE CONVERSATION IN NOTHING BUT HIGH PITCHED ""RING DING DONG"" AND BARKING. There are subtitles projected onto the wall behind them as they just ""sing"" Ring Ding Dong over and over again. So in the end Byeonggu was right, Manshik was the alien prince and in the end Manshik decides that earth is worth dealing with. 

So then Key comes out again. With the helmet and rainjacket looking all of seven years old and he broke my heart all over again.

He roughly said ""Mom, now we can be together again. But now that I'm gone who will look after the Earth"" in the saddest voice ever and on the screen behind him Earth explodes.

**End Spoilers** 

So yeah. This movie is wonderful, but the play was perfect. It was such an emotional rollercoaster and so well done and yet so simple. Key has come such a long way as an actor since he first started, and even since I first started watching his plays. This role truly showed just how amazing of an actor he actually is. And I am so fucking proud of him right now.

...and a little comment:  
Something amazing has happened! Ive suspected it with recent releases, and now everything is pointing towards that LOEN has signed with Spotify! All albums under this agreement can be recognized by the under license to Loen Entertainment Inc copyright tag on the album pages. This includes LOEN's own artists, subsidiaries and distributed labels. So far, this deal has directly made new releases from following artists available on Spotify:
History, Fiestar, Monsta X and WJSN (Starship), Apink and Jung Eunji (Plan A), Jaejoong, Junsu and Yuchun (C-JeS), Defconn (DI), Afos (DLABEL), April and Rainbow (DSP), Dalshabet and V.O.S (Happy Face) Lee SeungGi (Hook Entertainment), Yoon Han (KeyEast), Nuest and Seventeen (Pledis), Gfriend (Source Music), Teen Top and Up10tion (TOP Media), B.A.P (TS), Vibe (The Vibe Entertainment), and I.O.I (YMC).  
We can also expect future releases from artists on and under labels on [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LOEN_Entertainment_labels) to be available on Spotify.  
Also, Since WM (B1A4) is under LOENs distribution, it is possible that this answers my question from two weeks ago.  ",22,75

I've seen posts about Kakao and Skype both for here and for /r/kpopslumberparty but those posts haven't been very active so here's another try at this.

The link is: http://rkpop.stamplayapp.com/ and it's set up so that it will automatically send an email to you, you just need a username and email to signup.

For those who don't know, Slack is a messaging platform used by a lot of companies/teams but what's nice about it is that people can create multiple channels so we can easily have channels for all the fandoms and then anything and everything related to kpop (help, meetups, selling/buying, etc) and everything is all in one location.",15,11

2096,2016-5-23,2016,5,23,7,4kkvio,Which live performance of your favourite artist should everyone see?,zephr0x,1463956345,"We all like different groups and artist. but i'm sure we do not know all of them, alot of songs and performances we will never see simply because you are not into that certain group or artist. So **what is a performance you feel like everyone should see atleast once?**, whether it is too make the artist get more recognition or just because you just feel like everyone should atleast see this one video before deciding if they like them or not.. ~~Also don't forget to explain why it is your favourite  performance.~~  :)

my favourites are:

[Drunken Tiger - 8:45 Heaven
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAUeXCaP-OQ) This performance is one of a kind, Although Tiger is not as active as years ago this one performance will always stay with me. the amount of emotion in this song is unbelieveble especially in this video you can hear him having a hard time. aswell as the radio dj crying atloud.
for those who don't know 8:45 Heaven was written for his grandmother that passed away back then .



[Kim Jin Ho - Famility portrait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2LM89xw-g) i've seen alot of performances and heard alot of songs, but i think this song &amp; performance in particular is something out of this world. I have never heard any artist sing with such emotion sincerity and power at the same time. Aswell as his raw vocals no need to shape his voice make it feel like he is singing from his heart. 
Although im more a fan of the Immortal Songs 2 version, i feel like  that performances was also helped by the video in the back and explaining his story in this video he didn't do any of those and yet touched the audience

Also shout out too [''PSY - 'DREAM OF GOOSE' Performance at 2013 SEOUL CONCERT ""HAPPENING""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MBlTPLj5-g) dont think this one needs explaination if you watch it :)",163,127

2255,2016-5-24,2016,5,24,22,4ktpwk,Jonghyun's Showcase Fan Account,ladauphine,1464095845,"I tried to control myself... I failed. The Shawol Effect.

For /u/amandapearl2 and /u/GoldenLioness who requested this!!

Since the announcement of Jonghyun's comeback and the notice for this Showcase I've been stressed. 

I tried ticketing through No24. It was over in seconds, I've never seen tickets go so fast. 

I hoped to try for a ticket through the ""White T-Shirt"" event where you could get one of 50 tickets for a   designed shirt after I got off work. This was folly too. Girls had been lining overnight and they gave out those spots at 11 am. 

I designed the the shirt during my lunch break and I'm actually pretty pleased with how it turned out. Even more pleased because a few hours after I had made my shirt the album details came out and my design turned out to be T[HE FREAKING COVER OF THE ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/f4zRC). 

But, I couldn't not try. I worked within walking distance of the venue so I walked over as soon as I finished. There were probably 30 girls hanging around but most of them already had tickets. So I just watched the venue with them across the little street. 

We saw Jjong come back and do a few stage related things with the crew (glass walls and doors) and then more and more girls started showing up. 

Finally they started sorting us. The T Shirt tickets, the ticket winners from online and then my folk. 

The security guy who was dealing with us was really cute. He was really sweet and gentle with us and he referred to us in a really cute way. The word literally means ""those without things"". 

So my friends and I were very close to the front of our line. They put me first cause I'm the Jonghyun stan in the group. And we waited. All the other lines went in and it was just us. 

They made us wait until the last minute. They had to let as many of the official ticket holders in first. One friend felt nauseous. We could hear the screams and seeing the girls waving when he popped out on one of the balconies. 

Finally our sweet security guard cane out with a stack of mini posters and glow bracelets. They only had a few left over from the staff stock. I was the last person to get the glow bracelet. But suddenly two of the staff girls came over and took theirs off and gave them to my friends cause she knew it'd mean a lot more to my friends than it would to her. 

Finally they let us in. Jonghyun was just starting the Deja Boo remix. We went straight into screaming and fanchanting. 

He talked for minute after (I think O.O). Then the live highlight medley started. 

So I'm not going to put this cleanly. He was straight up eye fucking girl after girl the entire time. He came over and made one of those faces towards my part of the crowd and I swear it was only because we were packed so tightly that we didn't all immediately collapse. 

Orbit was fantastic, he had us sing along and we caught on really fast so the impromptu fanchants sounded nice. 

Red had everyone in hysterics. Every time he would say ""I love you"" everyone would lose their collective shit over and over again. 

Dress Up was amazing. The atmosphere was totally like a club everyone was jumping and screaming and everyone was so into it. And Jesus he was singing so hard his neck veins were popping out, hnng. 

During the highlight medley he was just so happy and interactive. He was so into it. Ugh it was great. 

Then the back up dancers streamed out and he did White T-Shirt. The whole reason why we had a dress code. 

When he was saying ""around-round"" I almost died. He was so cheeky my god. The dancer girls were so pretty, the choreography was so eye catching. 

After that Minho cane out. Shit lost yet again, quite the press forward and they said ""whoa whoa"" and had us scoot back. They chatted for a minute then everyone freaked out and looked up and there was Key and Taemin coming down the stairs. 

I could not believe it. Like in hindsight I shouldn't have been surprised. The SHINee members are so into each other's shit, of course a couple would show.. 

It was so cute how most of the time, Jonghyun was rather quiet and just smiled his derp smile while watching the other three argue and tease each other. 

The highlight of this was the Great Roast of Lee Taemin. When he was talking about why he didn't use Cocktail he said it's because he has no experience with the subject matter... Literally all of the Shawols just were like ""eeeehhhhhhh???"" and he was SO UNCOMFORTABLE. The others egged it on too. And Tae just kept digging his hole deeper. 

Bitch we know better. 

Then when the chat was over the three went off the side of the stage while the Behind the Scenes played and Jjong took a break. 

They were within 5 feet of me. A lot of the girls around me were watching them and not the video so Key and Minho moved off into the shadows but Taemin wanted to watch the video too and he was leaning so close. It was so hard to watch the video with him right by me. 

Then Jjong came out and did ""She Is"" and Jesus Christ that was amazing. We were impromptu fanchanting and jumping and everyone was just deliriously happy. 

And then it was over. Jonghyun thanked us and said ""this has been SHINee"" before he left. His dedication to his group even during his solo gives me so many feels. 

My friends and I left pretty quickly. It was late and we all live on the other side of the city.  But we decided to get dinner at McDonald's as there is a really fancy one by the concert venue. 

Pretty much as soon as we got our food I had a feels attack and just started crying in happiness. When I opened my eyes my asshole friends had been filming me. Their justification: if Taemin can do it so can they. :/ hmph. 

We took a taxi home, and passed the workers putting up the banners all along the main Apgujeong road. I thought it was just the one side but this morning I was walking to work and there was [Jonghyun banner after Jonghyun banner my whole walk to work](http://imgur.com/vaXv5Az) (forgive the shit picture, we were late cause I was moving slow on like 3 hours sleep, I was up till 1 for the album release and then got up at 5 to watch Game of Thrones before I got spoiled #priorities). It was freaking great. 

Kpop fan Moral of the story: always go, ticket or no ticket. You never know if a miracle will happen when you get there. 


This showcase meant so much to me. I did this same thing for his debut showcase (no ticket, pathetically lurking like a bad smell) but no pity was taken. I've been low key salty about it ever since not going to lie. But this made up for it. So much. Jesus this was amazing. 

Now to finish my work tonight. THen tomorrow afternoon run around the outskirts of Seoul to apply for fansigns then the Garden Studio tomorrow night from midnight to 2 am. I can sleep when I'm dead.

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated. (This will never happen)

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

SNSD celebrated their 7th anniversary a couple months before Jessica left. 

SHINee debuted May 25th, 2008 on [SBS Inkigayo] (https://youtu.be/wCmicO3AANQ). Their average age was 16.4 years old, ranging from Onew at 18 and to Taemin at 14. 

In this time they have released eight studio albums (four Korean, four Japanese), three repackaged albums, five mini-albums, and four live concert albums. They have also released two albums and two minis (plus a compilation album) as soloists. SHINee has conducted eight SHINee World tours.

I lived in Korea from 2009~2014, and when GD &amp; TOP debuted, they held a special VIP-only concert/performance in a hotel somewhere in Seoul. There was a contest on Facebook where you could submit a comment on a post, and the comment with the most likes would be invited. I think they took the top 20 posts, or something. Anyway, I ended up winning and was invited. The concert was around Christmas time... I think it may even have been on Boxing Day (December 26th to non-Commonwealth countries). I decided not to go because I didn't want to have to take the train up to Seoul, find a motel, lug around a bag, etc... Basically I was just lazy. 

I found out later that GD ended up performing ""Heartbreaker"" and a couple of other solo songs, and that the venue was really, really intimate with only a few hundred people in attendance.

Feel free to downvote or help (your call).**


Hey all!

I'm a mod over at /r/kpopgfys, the official subreddit for Kpop GIFS. Currently, we're doing a complete re-haul of our sub design and part of that is creating a high quality version of our existing [banner](http://i.imgur.com/pf68QSH.png). It was created by a member of our community who has been away from Reddit for quite some time now, so he can't help us out in finding the sources to get high quality versions of the individual stills in the banner.

This is where you could really help us out by identifying the sources (variety show, music show, etc) for the stills in the banner or better yet help us track down better quality versions of them. 

**[Here is the banner again](http://i.imgur.com/pf68QSH.png)** and any help would be *greatly* appreciated.

Thanks all and have a good one! :)

EDIT: Just to clarify, I have tried cropping the individual stills and running a google search on them to see what turned up. No luck I'm afraid :/",19,20

From what I've gathered, $25 for a three-day convention pass isn't too bad (the price is based off of last year's price), considering that my friends and I will probably get P5 tickets. But we're just students, and if our money is going into something that isn't worthwhile, we'd rather not go to the convention at all. For those of you who went to last year's KCON, or maybe even the years before, would you suggest us going to the convention? I know that fan engagements (where you meet the idols themselves) are at the convention (hi-touch, audience engagement), but aside from those engagements, is there anything else special to the convention? Thanks! ",8,5

Boy Groups: I guess I'm a bit biased because of my flair, but I really do think Seventeen has some of the most unique choreo I've seen in a while. I love how they change it up and they make it enjoyable for the crowd. Props to Hoshi. Some runner ups would probably be Romeo and Up10tion. I was initially impressed by Romeo by their synchronization and I've always enjoyed Up10tion's dances.

This is Chaewon (17):  https://twitter.com/DISK611/status/736667339240837122

Chaeyeon was not present at the event for obvious reasons.  And as [previously speculated in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoItAmazing/comments/4jvf3z/rumor_choreographer_ultrawin_tags_current_7/), Seunghee is most definitely out of the group and MBK altogether at this point.  This also explains why [there was only 7 members during their MV filming](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoItAmazing/comments/4j8cjs/info_7_members_were_at_mv_filming_according_to/).  In other words, the current lineup is like this: (Eunice), (Cathy), (Jenny), (Chaeyeon), (Yebin), (Eunjin), and (Chaewon).

All 7 girls will likely start promoting together officially with the upcoming Dream Concert next week in June.  Meanwhile the group will be preparing for their comeback later in the same month.  ",10,32

It was rumored that Brown Eyed Girls' Jea(don't know if this is spelled right) refused to participate in Immortal Songs 2 (KBS variety) and KBS didn't like it, so they gave BEG 0 points for their album sale which made them 11th on the chart(supposed to be 2nd). BEG fans were mad because BEG was going head to head even in almost every category to Heo Gak, who won that week.

**2NE1's I am the best**

This was when T-Ara was a sensation with Roly-Poly, but 2NE1 won with ""I am the Best"" which was released couple months(?) ago. T-Ara led almost every category with a significant margin, but KBS gave 2NE1 around 4K points for album sales only. This caused a heated discussion because another song in the same mini album (Hate you) did not get that 4K album sale points. People speculated that this was a gesture of KBS to end the conflict with YG at that time, because YG label groups did not participate in MBank at that time.


**T-Ara again**

T-ara's You Make Me Crazy vs Kara's Lupin. I did not see this one live, but I later saw the picture of points allocated. T-Ara won by 500 points, Kara wins anyway. Turned out that there was a mistake and Kara's and T-ara's numbers were switched. MCs gave the trophy to Kara, who is the rightful winner.


**FTIsland sets a few new records**

my fave band FT Island sets a few record with their 5th album ""I Will."" First week of April FT Island won with Pray, vs Ice Cream Cake by Red Velvet. FT Island set a record low of 180 points for digital sales point, but still won. Previous record low was 652 points by Super Junior D&amp;E.

 Pray make another record the week after, by placing 47th on the chart. Pray make another record the week after, by being outside of top 50 on the chart. it was the fastest disappearance of all time, but no one talked about it because in the world of K POP no one except Primadonna cares about FT Island any more. (and it was also EXO's Call me baby who took over so everyone talked about EXO)



KBS only admitted their mistake on that Kara vs Tara incident. Other than that they never spoke anything about it.",4,19

See if you can pick out the leader/maknae/visual/main vocalist/main dancer/etc.,abluegold,1464514036,"Taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4az95c/discussion_watch_a_music_video_of_a_group_you/). 

I was bored, so I decided to do this for myself. Picked [Oh My Girl's Cupid](https://youtu.be/fCrCUv6rQ7I).

Here were my results:

http://i.imgur.com/5E3g4aq.jpg
This girl looks really young. The maknae.

http://i.imgur.com/Krbg4uu.jpg
Super pretty. She seems like she'd either be one of the more quiet members of the group or one of the more quirky members. Or both, even. Part of the vocal line.

http://i.imgur.com/q05i67i.jpg
[Joy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BwiGKv4CAAAyVbI.jpg)??
Her singing parts are more difficult and often comes with the main singer. So I'm gonna say she's a lead vocalist. But she also seems like the main dancer?? I see her at the front/center a lot during formations, but I don't think she's the visual. I'm gonna say she's a lead vocalist (specifically, the second best singer) and the main dancer.

http://i.imgur.com/XbHLHVx.jpg I think this girl's the visual. She's more standard-looking. She has a pretty voice. But I think she's a dancer. Though, she seems to get the same amount of parts as the ~~first~~ edit: second girl, who I said was a vocalist. One of the more well-rounded members, maybe?

http://i.imgur.com/yKtR5f1.jpg
Obviously the rapper.

http://i.imgur.com/1iw1ISy.jpg
That high note. Obviously the main singer. My first impression was that she's one of the maknaes; she looks pretty young. I get the feeling that she's headstrong. She probably makes a lot of sassy comments.

http://i.imgur.com/mGe5IHI.jpg
I didn't see this girl come up a lot. She looks the oldest, so I'm gonna say she's the leader. Part of the dance line.

http://i.imgur.com/wOBkJZc.jpg
This girl mostly gets the talk-singing parts, so she's not a vocalist. I'm gonna say lead dancer. She looks like she'd have a super cute personality.

After watching that video like 10 times trying to figure it out, I think I've become a casual fan, haha. Found myself checking out the rest of their music. I like them.

Try for yourself. Or you can suggest videos for other people to do too.",72,63

Also, I recently discovered most of the songs from Sugar Man are available on spotify, just with everything in Hangul. I made a playlist: [Sugar Man](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/0mig8ZaDeeWHXpJPMrbLWq), but it'll probably help to know either which episode the artist you want to hear appear in, or their name in Hangul.  
Also, for you out there with apple/google/other streaming site accounts, I can't link them since I don't have them, but most releases I listed are probably there as well.

2756,2016-5-30,2016,5,30,6,4lmgkq,Jonghyun's Inkigayo Fanmeet,ladauphine,1464559050,"This inki was your usual inki. 4 am check in. Smelly as fuck sidewalk. Too many people on a too long sidewalk with only one person loud enough to be heard on both ends. Only difference. The fanmeet. It was announced about two hours after the notice went up. 

My friends and I had camped at a nearby cafe and we all got really good numbers. I was 46 which is insanely high for a weekend show. 

But we were pissed when the fanmeet was announced. Cause that means that all the fans who normally can't be fucked to come out will show up for the fanmeet. When this happens we always get pushed out of the recordings and we all wanted to see White T Shirt sooo bad. Just to clarify. We were NOT pissed about the fanmeet itself, we were super excited about it. We were pissed because the manager put up the notice so early which means people who normally wouldn't have bothered to show up would come for it. It is nice when the manager puts up fanmeet notices the morning of cause that means it is mostly just the people who would have been there to support Jonghyun anyhow get the special event.

We went to the night check in, and we remembered a few important things. 1) They're using the Odd cards for ranking this weekend and not the Joah cards, and odd cards are much rarer and give us much better positions and 2)Jonghyun simply doesn't draw as many fans as Taemin does. Tae draws a hundred ish a weekend just from Japan, let alone Korea. 

We all ended up getting into She Is at ass O clock this morning. That silhouette sheet made for really entertaining situations. His shadow was really big but if he stepped in front of the back light, you could see his tiny self. The camera guys also zoomed hella up on him (like an intimate view of his nose) and we were dying and he was like ""whaaaaaattt?"". He recorded like 4 times and he was really cute and happy the whole time. 

Then we all went out to a fuck ton of confusion. Shawol General had to decide who was getting into White T-Shirt which recorded second. She decided to let the S7s who'd been cut go first. Then S1. Then any S11 who showed up, and then she kept 25 S4 just in case not many S11 showed. After being sorted I was S4-17. 

Quick explanation: SHINee World rankings are based on what cards you have plus the album and digital purchase printout. Normally there is only up to S10 that is really a thing, but today we had rankings up to 12. S11 was people who showed up after the actual 6 am SM check but before White T Shirt, and S12 are the people who showed up only for the fanmeet.

Well when it came time to organize our lines for White T-Shirt, it seemed that more than enough S11 had showed to push not only all 25 S4 out of the recording but the last 20 or so S1. 

So lets just get this out here. On the best day, going to the live kinda sucks. Even if it is a terrific lineup lives are just weird and pretty dull in my opinion. But on fanmeet days, going to the live is literally the worst thing EVER. And all of the the cut S1 and up to S4-09 had to go into the live, but as I was S4-17 I WAS CUT HALLELUJAH PRAISE THE LORD.

You see the fanmeet is organized by who got into the most things. Those with the least get to go in first. So the order ended up being, S4-10- all the rest of S4, then S5, 6, 7. Then S1, 2, and 3. THEN The Live people, and last S11 and S12. 

So if you're following this. I was in the front row. Again. This happened during Taemin promotions too. But this was better. Omg This was better.

So after they got the live girls sorted, I swear every SM staffer showed up and they all held up janky little signs with rankings and we all organized ourselves by number and rank impressively fast on that small ass sidewalk. Then the Shawol general came over to my line and told us to follow her. 

She was the Miss Clavel to our Madeline. She led us two by two down the road, across the street (shouting at us to run quickly across) and then led us up to the school yard of an elementary school with a raised platform (probably for the gym teacher to stand on and shout at kids). She sat us down in two nice rows. And I was not only very front, but dead center too. It was rather frightening.

It took about 20 minutes for all the staffers to lead their little duckling Shawols over and get us all seated. Then we waited. It was hot as balls. Suddenly we hear a lot of ""OOOOOOHHHH"" and whenever you hear your fellow fangirls make that noise you perk up and look in that direction. It was too early for Jjong (he still had to do the end stage) but it turned out he had bought us all ice cream!! It was actually more like a packaged Icee but still. It was apple flavored and cold and had this weird packaging where you rip off the top and it looks  like a bottle but you either bit or squeeze the stuff out. It was great.

Then finally our General ran over and told us to put our umbrellas away and take off our weird jacket turbans and such cause Jonghyun was on his way. 

He came out and just from the start he was so cute. His pink hair was getting all blown around in the wind, and his black and red outfit looked so nice. And most importantly he was so freaking smiley. 

There was the opening usual questions about has he eaten, did he sleep and he asked the same of us. Then he asked if we liked his gift and there was a chorus of NEEEE's. He turned around and saw the staff had left him one too.

He ripped open the wrapper and immediately dropped the small bit. We all started shouting at him there would be a fine (we were told that) and he was like ""Oh I'll get it later"" but then us front girls were like ""Nah dude, we will get it"". He then ripped the cap off of the plastic bottle thing WITH HIS TEETH. Omg I saw that right up close and personal and he kept it in his mouth for a second and I swear I may have gotten pregnant right then. It was a calculated move on his part, you could see him grinning at our little sighs of distress. Apparently the girl next to my friend whispered ""such a man"" when he did that. Throughout the entire fanmeet whenever he would eat a bit of the ice cream, my entire body would tense up. I dunno I was super fucking close and it was really fucking hot. I won't apologize.

Some of the things he talked about:

* His favorite song from the album is Orbit. When he asked us about ours everyone was shouting Dress Up but but me and like two girls next to me were shoutings   (Oojooga Isseo, Orbit) as loud as we could. It seemed like he was listening for it and so he zeroed in on us (hnnnnggg) and agreed. He ended up singing a short acapella version of the rap in Orbit just after this. Before he started the rap it took him a minute of trying to find his place in the song, he was looking off at the sky and tapping the microphone cutely.

* Talked about the 8th anniversary and how he and the rest of SHINee gathered in a hotel that night (they were in Shanghai on the 24th) and reminisced all night.
 
* Little story about how Roo peed on the bed and his mom scolded her so she hid in Jonghyun's room.

* Said its been 5 years since he wrote Suit up (and that he didn't realize girls would like the song so much -_-), 3 years since She Is, 2 years for Cocktail, 1 year for Red,and like 5 months since he wrote Dress Up and Moon which he wrote both of them in one day each. First Dress up and the next day Moon.

* The reason he doesn't post on Twitter or Insta much anymore is because he forgot his password and changed phones so now if he wants to he has to get his old phone on WIfi. Also just less interest.
 
* Said he goes home every Monday and watches Game of Thrones (I'm totally asking him about this at my second fansign). Asked if we had watched anything good lately and we all shouted CANOLA. Minho's movie. He said it was amazing and that we should all see it many times.

* Said he loved looking at our ocean at concerts. Said that he and the members would always look at us from backstage and talk about how beautiful we were.
 
* Said that he looked up a lot of interpretations of his MV and that a lot of them were right. I'm assuming all of the paranoid ones.

* Said that he wouldn't wear glasses for any performances for safety reasons but that he would be wearing the full pink outfit and that he would wear the glasses to a fansign. I'm very nervous about this as I have two fansigns this week. One tonight and one Wednesday.
 
* Said in reference to SHINee ""We will continue being here. When you find us we will make sure you can see us. Whatever happens to us, the five of us will fight through it"" 


He really didn't come into the fanmeet with any sort of plan so he just fielded questions from us and asked a few back. At one point he was asked to walk around all of us like Taemin did and he said no. Everyone started whining and he mocked us by making really exaggerated crying faces and noises. He is terrible. 

At one point (as this was in the open) a family walked by and he noticed them staring so he turned around and said hello and waved at the little boy who was SO HAPPY. He also saw a grandmother watching him when he came off the stage and he greeted her and bowed to her.

Towards the end, he was trying to finish his ice cream fast and ended up dripping some on his shirt. He looked down at it so surprised and was like ""oh well its a black shirt who cares"".

Finally he was saying goodbye. We had asked him to take a picture and so his manager brought over his phone. He was up on the platform and started crouching lower and lower to try and fit us all in. Finally he just sat with his back against the bars. I was close enough that I could see the pic he took.

It was supposed to be a selca but he wanted to get all of us in as best he could so it was just us with a tuft of pink hair at the bottom. Then as he struggled to get up he realized that SM had sent a camera person. He sighed and sat down again. She took a minute to try and get us all in as well. 

Then he came down off the platform and decided to do the run around us anyhow. He is so tiny. God I always forget how small he is. He smiled at each of us in the front row I swear. Then he took off running. And immediately his sweater fell off his hips onto the dusty ground. He picked it up and went on jogging around us. All I could see of most of it was his pink hair bouncing up and down.

Then he came back to the front to get the piece of trash he dropped. Well it had done blown away (honestly I think it blew past the girl a few down from me and she just kept it) and he wasn't really paying attention so he just picked up a piece of trash.

He looked at it like ""well this isn't right"". The ice cream packaging was yellow and this was blue. But at this point he couldn't exactly drop it again. So there he was just cutely staring at some other dudes trash while we laughed at him. He cutely said goodbye one more time and went to his manager. He tried to give the trash to his manager who just ignored him so Jonghyun put it in his pocket.

Then it was over. The Shawols streamed out. Lots of tears everywhere, especially us front row girls. There was lots of eye contact for us, lots of scrunchy smiles aimed at us, he could hear everything we said. 

It was wonderful. A wonderful end to a really long day (we had been up for 15 hours at 6 pm when he left the fanmeet). Jonghyun is wonderful. Every time I see him like this, I just love him more and more.

Twice - http://fans.jype.com/BoardView?BoardName=twice_notice&amp;Num=158  
GOT7 - http://fans.jype.com/BoardView?BoardName=GOT7_Notice&amp;Num=291  
Day6 - http://fans.jype.com/BoardView?BoardName=DAY6_Notice&amp;Num=52  
  
There are 5 new rules that are the same for each group. A person that does any of these will be permanently blacklisted, and from then on can be held legally accountable if they continue these behaviors:  
&gt;1. Waiting for the group at unofficial schedules (outside dorms, etc)  
2. Following the group or their car to a destination  
3. Following the members' individual schedules  
4. Following the group after they pass the immigration counter at the airport  
5. Trying to touch them or stay/walk too close to them while they are moving (anywhere).  
  
What do you think?  
I personally am glad they are trying to improve the groups' safety! I hate seeing any idols be rushed at and touched and all that. You can still support them, just give them space and privacy!  
I do wonder what they mean with #3 though? It's very vague. For example, Jackson has a ton of individual schedules, but he has great relationship with his core group of fans both from/in Korea and China, so it would be sad to see this rule affect them! ",39,229

2944,2016-5-31,2016,5,31,22,4lv68c,[Eng] GQ Korea interview with Red Velvet's Irene,seulgitho,1464700926,"This is a pretty in depth and insightful interview from GQ Korea. It takes a much different approach than most interviews you get with idols. I thought it would be interesting to post here for those reasons as well as the fact that Irene is one of the more introverted members, not just in her group, but Idols in general. Which is why to see a unique interview like this was an interesting read to say the least and I thought worth posting for discussion.

&gt; *Shes called Irene. She is also called Red Velvets Irene. There are, of course, people who call her Joohyun-ah. 1991-er born in spring. On an early summer-like day.*
&gt; 
&gt; **The weather changed completely while you were shooting.**

&gt; I heard. They said it was raining outside.

&gt; **You dont sound very excited about it. Whats on your mind right now?** 

&gt; I think its my first time coming by myself today.

&gt;**Ah, its your first time doing an interview on your own.** 

&gt; My heart was fluttering, it was simply just fluttering. I couldnt sleep at all last night. 
&gt; 
&gt; **I think I know that feeling, but its true that I actually dont at all.**

&gt; By myself Because Im by myself. **[Tears twinkling her eyes]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dont try to be careful with what you say. Just be comfortable.** 

&gt; In the past, doing anything on my own made me uneasy. As time passed, I came to think a lot about what it means to express myself. I thought a lot about how to express this shoot. However, I didnt get the thought that I would be lonely or uneasy because my members were not here with me. **[The interview halted for a moment. On a rainy, Sunday evening. There was a lady seated in front of me, forcing herself to hold back her tears]**
&gt; 
&gt; **How were you as a child?** 

&gt; When I was young, my very first dream was to become an announcer. In fifth grade, an unnie I knew in 6th grade was the announcer for the schools broadcasting club. That unnie looked so cool. So I told the unnie that oh, I wanted to try, and she told me I needed to take a test. There was a writing portion and a performance portion. On the writing, there were common knowledge questions such as what is the date of the presidential election. But I passed. I got to be an announcer for one year.
&gt; 
&gt; **There are people who quickly go between I want to and I am doing this.** 

&gt; Thats true. If theres something that I want to do, I just experienced it. I wanted to learn makeup so I did, I wanted to become a stewardess so I immediately looked up cram schools for it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Its becoming almost 2 years since Red Velvet was revealed to the world, correct? Its probably a lot different from the times when you were able to do whatever you wanted to. There are people watching you.**

&gt; I believe that people judge me the way they do because I look like that to them. (She stopped talking once more). But it doesnt completely not bother me. I try not to make it obvious. I want people to not know me. Actually, I get influenced a lot [about what others think of me]. But I always think. So that I can love myself more, I can make myself less lonely, I can make myself stronger, like that. **[The interview paused for a long time. The editor chattered away to give her time to settle down].**
&gt; 
&gt; **At first, I couldnt differentiate Irenes face from the others. But one moment I started to, and should I say that there were shadows on your face? If there is light, there has to be shadows; its just an honest statement. How can a human being live within just their concept and character. Although you look like youre having the most fun on stage, when you come off the stage, or after youve come off the stage, you seem like a person who really needs her own time and space.**

&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Do you like yourself?**

&gt; I always write down how I feel about myself. In the past, I constantly wrote a daily journal. These days, I make short notes.
&gt; 
&gt; **When you were given the concept of writing memos in the notebook, there was a reason that clicked. You know the difference between typing away on a keyboard and pressing down on a pen?** 

&gt; I really do. I dont leave my home often, and the only place I do go is the cafe in front of the house. When I go there, I take my pencil case and notebook. Its an empty and quiet place so I stay there for hours writing things down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Do you have a pen or paper you like?**

&gt; I thought about that. I wondered why I dont have any I like this exact pen or I like that pen thoughts. Why do I not have anything along the lines of I like exactly this or I like exactly that? Why do I not have anything of my own?
&gt; 
&gt; **What was the conclusion to your thoughts?**

&gt; Every pen is different. The shape, color, and feeling is all different. I like this pen for this reason, and I like that pen for that reason. I thought that there was no reason in having to only like just one.
&gt; 
&gt;**I suddenly thought of this question. How did you end up becoming a singer?**

&gt; In my freshmen year of high school, my friend asked me to go with her to an audition so I did. But I didnt make it. Thats when I knew. I really want to do this. I didnt know that I would cry so much on the spot where I failed my audition.
&gt; 
&gt;**Your personality of having to try everything comes out there as well.**

&gt; Thats correct. Then suddenly one day, I got a phone call that they wanted to sign a contract with me. It was on the way to eat ddukbokki after self-study when I got the call. I just stood there [when I got the call].
&gt; 
&gt; [pretends to be on the phone] Hello? Hello? (laughs)
&gt; I remember that location and the air. To me, the current me, and the things that I feel right now is important. It all fades away with time. Thats why I write it down. Very specifically. I dont want to forget why I liked this song so much.
&gt; 
&gt;**How about your face? Do you know your face very well?**

&gt; My face? I dont really look in the mirror.
&gt; 
&gt; **Really?**

&gt; When I brush my teeth, I look only at my mouth. I brush my teeth. I rinse my mouth. During those times, I dont look at something else. I just look at my mouth. I look at my mouth, rinse, then come out [of the bathroom]. I dont look at my face much. So I dont realize when something happens to my skin. Someone has to tell me, Unnie, you have something here for me to know. When I go to the hair salon to do my hair, I only look at my hair. My attention doesnt head to somewhere else.
&gt; 
&gt; **Do you have a feeling about how you look?**

&gt; Dont I look a little prim and haughty?
&gt; 
&gt; **You also seem like a face that easily gets erased.**

&gt; Do I really?
&gt; 
&gt; **A face that seems to change without really knowing, should I say? I cant really catch it. Truthfully, Red Velvet as a team has that ambiguity to it as well. Not because you guys dont necessarily have a publicly hit song, but you guys seem to purposely make yourselves unrecognizable and dont stick to anything. So you make people want to keep looking at you. Irene also seems to have a face that fits being an actress.** 

&gt; I did try acting (laughs).
&gt; 
&gt; **Why are you laughing?**

&gt; Its nothing (laughs). I filmed a web drama, and I really liked it. What I got to feel while I read the script, and getting to hear the director explain to me this expression and that expression was enjoyable.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hows your voice?**

&gt; My voice is quiet. And slow.
&gt; 
&gt;**But its not frustrating. Because you dont mumble but speak clearly. Youre a person that listens to others words well, right?**

&gt; Right. People around me tell me, Your expression when you listen to other people is really good. Im not really sure what they mean, but they say that.
&gt; 
&gt; **How old do you perceive yourself?** 

&gt; Right now? (Speechless for quite a while). I dont think I think about my age.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thats fun. When I try to think of a man who may look good next to you, I imagine someone a lot older.** 

&gt; I like someone warm. Someone whose gaze or actions are warm.
&gt; 
&gt; **It seems different from someone whos always just good to you.**

&gt; Thats right. I dont really like the whole pulling out the chair and taking care of me thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Someone like a big tree.**

&gt; That seems right. I never knew how to express it so I just said a big dog (laughs) like person. I really enjoy taking pictures of trees.
&gt; 
&gt; **What kind of pictures do you have the most of on your phone?** 

&gt; The sky and trees. (Suddenly takes out her phone and shows me her gallery). I look up at the sky often. When I was a trainee, I used to ride the swings for a really long time. I realized this is my first time talking about these things. Talking about myself like this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thats what interviews are for.**

&gt; When practice ended, I swung on the swings for three to four hours. I looked up at the skies then. The stars were so beautiful. After that, I ended up looking at the sky more often. Even if it involves making time, I look up at the sky.
&gt; 
&gt; **Do you have a season you like?**

&gt; When the cherry blossoms bloom.
&gt; 
&gt; **Your birthday is around that time, right?** 

&gt; Yes. There are a lot of cherry blossom trees near Lake Bomun in Kyungju. I would always go down there with my family to ride bikes. I heard its raining a lot today, but its still spring to me. It still feels like spring to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summer is coming soon.**

&gt; I also like it when it snows. I didnt get to see a lot of snow in Daegu. After becoming a trainee, I came up to Seoul, and there was so much snow falling. (Now that I look at it, the sandwich on the table is still there).
&gt; 
&gt; **You said you were hungry earlier.**

&gt; Im fine now.
&gt; 
&gt; **What does Irene want to become?**


&gt; I always think. If I were to become a stronger person. If I were to be stronger.
