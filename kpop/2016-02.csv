0,2016-2-1,2016,2,1,10,43m0rw,When did you realize a group had become your bias?,JazzberryRose,1454288957,"I'm freaking out over how hard I fell for BTS. Just 9 months ago, I had never heard of them. I saw a bunch of other Youtubers reacting to I Need U and decided to react myself. Loved the song and video, but didn't pay any more attention to them. Same with Dope, loved the song but still didn't know the members. The only member I learned was Rap Monster because his voice and face are so distinct. It wasn't until I watched Run that I realized how talented (and handsome) they truly are. I started learning their names. Jin quickly shot up to become my ultimate bias with his eating videos. Which is still a little weird to me since I never had a UB before. But the rest still seemed like a blob of guys I couldn't tell apart and didn't really care to. 

Then their Weekly Idol episode came out, and the Bangtan Bomb was dropped. By the end of the episode, I knew all the members. I went on a BTS spree, watching AHL, all their videos and listening to their albums. I finally understand the meaning of bias. Super Junior had been my favorite group since 2007, but I never fangirled over them. I never cared to learn their likes and dislikes or personalities. I kinda feel weird about it considering every member is younger than me (although Jin is only a week younger). But kpop had gotten a little stale for me, so I'm happy to be this excited about a group. When did you bias group shoot up to the top for you?",142,49

4,2016-2-1,2016,2,1,10,43m81p,[PLAYLIST] 2016 | Week 5 - Chill / Mellow,Selphade,1454291826,"Hi /r/kpop!

Your results are in for the next playlist. You provided 173 nominations resulting in 87 songs for the Workout / Hype playlist. There was a lot more voting, which is great! The more desired songs are put on the playlist, so keep it up.

----------------------------

Here are the previous weeks' playlists.

**[\[Week 1 - Cheerful / Mood Lifting\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHg9jrbVhcXJ91Kq7T_jcfSP)**

**[\[Week 2 - Sad / Heartbroken\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjtCQvQftdB1M8FVTpm42Xc)**

**[\[Week 3 - Hip-Hop + R&amp;B\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjig_XDbMrLJYHvti36EuOi)**

**[\[Week 4 - Workout / Hype\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgZDiVNF4H5UOfGKLrF0wBE)**

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Chill and Mellow songs. Nominate your favourte songs that you listen to when you like to lay or sit back and relax. Maybe while you're outside on a nice sunny day sippin' drinks on a hammock, or you just finished a marathon or a test and need some sweet music to keep you company to rest to. 

------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **(Sunday, February 7th, 11:59pm PST)**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

There is not another voting scheme for upcoming themes, as no one has PMed me any themes! To next week, if there aren't any more ideas, I'll brainstorm some more.

Upcoming themes are:

* Dance and Uptempo (Party!)

* Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs

* Kpop B Songs (Songs that aren't promoted on albums)

* Electro / Futuristic Kpop

* Dark / Sinister


----------

Remember to keep voting! If your songs or songs that you liked didn't make it to the playlist last time, it was because there weren't enough songs nominated or there weren't as many upvotes.

In no particular order:

* [Rock] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys)

&gt; This song is simply amazing. The instrumental has layers added to it throughout the song, eventually leading to an incredible climax which gives me chills every time I hear it. The vocals are also fantastic, with booming notes that 'fill your ears' occasionally being broken up by high notes which, due to the contrast, seem to pierce right through the middle of your head.

* [Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore - Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59AA1fNsPQ)

&gt; Smooth (and I mean smoooooooooooooooooooooooth) vocals coupled with an even smoother instrumental. What's not to like? You'll fall in love with this song as soon as you hear the falsetto in the chorus.

* [Rock] [Phonebooth - The End of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDiRbA7Bfk)

&gt; Really interesting sound that I haven't heard from many other Korean rock bands. The drums and guitars keep it relatively low-key until the chorus hits, which gives the song a chill and 'spacey' vibe to it. It's a nice change of pace from other bands like [MAAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5PDERBzkF4), [The Koxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMZYdSh_GzU), [Startline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwn_pK3vvOA), and etc who tend to have their instruments stick out rather than stay in the background.


* [Dream Pop] [Swimmers - Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPBw7XC37XA)

&gt; Korean dream pop might be my favorite thing ever. Definitely check this out if you're a fan of [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), because I get similar vibes from this band (though their sound is much less electronic than Yukari's). PS: [Yukari's new album](https://www.facebook.com/ukarimusik/photos/a.233486646747025.49765.160063190756038/887448564684160/?type=3&amp;theater) is coming out soon! Who else is hyped??

* [Rock] [Every Single Day - Sweet Illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE235n3SN-c)

&gt; Came out November 26, 2015, but I'm putting it on this list anyway! I've had this song playing in my car for the past couple of months and I don't see that changing any time soon. The chorus is catchy as hell and I feel like I want to get up and jump around whenever I hear it (which might not be the best thing to do when I'm driving). Definitely one of my favorite songs of 2015

* [Electronic] [Now &amp; Then - This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNm6-oYuX8)

&gt; This song is just... cool. Give it a listen.

* [Rock] [The Black Skirts - Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq_gsctWHtQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt; Definitely the most mainstream of this bunch, but fantastic nonetheless! Recently signed to Tablo's HIGHGRND.

* [RnB] [Big Brain - Break Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xpg-iWmyFM)

&gt; Might be the best male vocalists on this list. I'm not really an RnB guy (well, besides my boy [Baek Sang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2SdnXuVRU)), but this song is great.

---

I hope you guys enjoyed these songs! I'm hoping to be added as a moderator of /r/KoreanMusic soon so I can sticky a post to the top of subreddit at the end of February where everyone can post and talk about their favorite songs from that month (which I'll then post as a list on /r/KPop). If you have any favorite K-Indie songs from the past two months feel free to share them here!",15,104

All in all, while I agree that the wording, tone and attitude in their comments, were condescending and insulting. I feel the content is incredibly important. It's quite interesting since the word itself Hip Hop, Hip being relevant, informed, knowledgeable and Hop being the movement. Is in itself the explanation to what it is. Many of you might not know this, but Rapping is just a part of Hip Hop, as is Graffiti, Breaking and DJing amongst many others. So in turn, maybe Idol should stop using terminology as Hip Hop themes, Hip Hop style etc Instead should limit themselves as rappers and perform rap music. As it would be unfair to compare Riff Raff and Jay Electronica, even though they both rap. 

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. B-Free made some very real statements about being broke until he made it, without compromising. The Cohort collectively kept it 100. Androgynous imagery is simply not Hip Hop, nor is it accepted by the community or involved in the artistry. Hip Hop was born in defiance of dominant culture and a resistance. Funnily enough, now there is a 'Hip Hop' artist in every Manufactured, Smokey-Eyed, Choreographed, Hyper-Marketed, Over-Produced Boy Band. Maybe instead of the half-hearted answers and backtracking from RapMonster, he could've claimed he just implemented 'rap lyrics' in their songs, while Hi-Lite and the likes, have a more well-rounded and authentic image of what Hip Hop wishes to present. But he (and his fans) enjoy his niche.",15,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUwqWsaE-ro

A few IMHO's that came to mind:

* From the first time I came across Apink I felt that they were obviously templated on Finkl's style, particularly the ""Eternal love"" concept. I'd bet that it's a big contributor to their success (at least in korea).

* Finkl had a killer voice in Ok JooHyun, who's now an internationally recognised musical actress, and Apink owes their success just as much to Jung EunJi's killer voice. I don't doubt that EunJi would be just as successful if she chooses to stay on the music side long-term.

* Apink's other members seem to have worked on their vocals quite hard compared to how they were back when they debuted.

* The song remains as iconic as ever, especially the pinky action, even with people who were too young to have known it when it came out.

For this, we are going to assume the situation is as a first pitch entails: Batter with no count, no runners on. Therefore balks are not enforced (this gets important for some pitchers).

Obviously this list is not all inclusive. I have to save material for next offseason :\^)

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/FloweryNecessaryHog)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWt5Y31zAAw)]

Pitching from the front of the mound. Ball bounces before the plate (even before the halfway point!) and crosses the foul line; an obvious **Ball 1**. Overall form is pretty bad, let's be honest. No glove (no hat, but we'll say the kitty ears pass uniform rules). Overall, a pretty awful pitcher. Stick her on first and hope she can dig some out some balls with her flexibility.

Grade: *F-*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/FlusteredLeanCockatiel)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVeo6QMcbW4)]

Pitching from the front of the mound. Ball makes it ""across"" the plate with room to hit the backstop, but the batter swings and misses, **Strike 1**. We'll say the nerves got to this rookie. Form is different, sure to throw off even veteran batters with her legwork and surprise delivery. Glove is a check. No hat (but look at that efficient and practical ponytail!). I'd give her some time in the bullpen and see if she can make it work.

Grade: *C*

**Taemi ""Tammy""** - *Taekwondoist/Actress* -&gt; *Doosan Bears*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/AmazingGreenGiraffe)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsH8fCtwmRk)]

Pitching from the rubber(!). Ball ""crosses"" the plate. Height looks good, but placement is just a bit too far outside. **Ball 1**. Rookie pitcher, I'm sure it was the jitters again. The Bears really seem to have a trend picking up pitchers with nontraditional deliveries. Again, I doubt anyone would be prepared to see this come out in even the ninth inning. Points for having a glove, but again, just a (practical) ponytail. I'd be a bit afraid of her getting tired and ending up on her back, so she'd do well in finishing the job rather than starting it.

Grade: *B-*

**Soojung Lee** - *Actress* -&gt; *Kia Tigers*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/JampackedWhoppingHorseshoebat)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1aR3GNfSio)]

Pitching from the rubber. Ball crosses the plate for a **Ball 1**, high. So close, probably just wanted to send a message a la Thor. I think the Tigers got a solid pitcher out of this contract. Not afraid to be aggressive with the batters even as a rookie. We finally have a glove AND A HAT. Impromptu ponytail on the mound though. Always be ready to take the field. Overall, she seems like a good, aggressive girl that isn't afraid to play dirty.

Grade: *B-*

**Suji ""Suzy"" Bae** - *Miss A* -&gt; *Dodgers*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/WellinformedInfantileEyelashpitviper)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMha9whJ92g)]

Pitching from the green (not even the warning track of the mound zzzzz). Ball comes in high across the plate, not even Hyunjin Ryu can frame this one good enough for the umpire: **Ball 1**. Rookie eephus pitcher with no confidence, surely to peter out mid season or earlier. If she hadn't taken those extra steps up, she might have had a good pitch into the zone. Poor form, you can see the lob ball coming from a mile away. Hat, no glove, no uni. It's like the Dodgers even know she's not going to be around long. If she had some more confidence, she'd be putting down guys left and right, but it seems she's going to be stuck way below her league.

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/ImmaterialGleamingItaliangreyhound)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-hik3SKxJM)]

Pitching from the front of the mound. Ball comes in at a high arc across the plate, but the batter goes for it. **Strike 1**. A good start, and our first strike in the list. Another eephus pitcher with a Cueto-esque wind-up. The Bears seem to be a bit greedy at this point. Hat, glove, and a goddamn full uniform. Hallelujah! I'd sign her for a 1 year deal if I was the Bears. Looks like she's ready to take on the big sticks.

Grade: *B+*

**Hyejin Han** - *Actress* -&gt; *Hanwa Eagles*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/FeminineEllipticalCuscus)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlGFbwXBOK4)]

Pitching from the front of the mound. Ball comes in way high, catcher can't even reel it in. Batter must have been watching right field do whirly-birds, 'cause he swung for **strike 1**. Form is old school with a double-rock, which hasn't been seen for quite some time. She has a full uniform, but I don't think that multi-tone glove is legal. Hopefully she can get adjusted and give a good performance, practice and experience will be key.

Grade: *D+*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/DeliriousPowerlessGelding)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJV4uRmHrI)]

Dodgers have given up on fielding a pitcher that can pitch from the mound and just covered it with a tarp. Ball comes in high, but somehow lands before the plate and rolls over the foul line for **Ball 1**, but the batter is still in the dugout, so I guess it's still a strike. Takes the time to get the sign from the catcher and make adjustments behind her back, but I'm not so sure about the high leg kick. Dodgers spending too much money on these foreign players, can't seem to get her a glove and hat. Sticks won't touch this girls stuff, and not because she's good at what she does.

Grade: *F-*

**Yumi Kim** - *Miss Korea* -&gt; *Kia Tigers*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/IdioticFoolhardyBluebottlejellyfish)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmeUC9TFuY)]

Pitching from half distance. Way too high, but the catcher reels it in with an outstanding vertical. Batter leaves the bunt out for a **Strike 1**. Form: Shakes off the sign, then switches from wind up to a stretch delivery. Primadonna, thinking she can do whatever she wants. Pink hat, not within uniform colors (noncomformity is unbecoming in a team sport), but she does have a glove. Big ego with nothing to back it up, time to send her down to the minors. She'll come back on her knees.

Grade: *F-*

**Yuna Kim** - *Olympic Team* -&gt; *Samsung Lions*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/VictoriousFirmAsianpiedstarling)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6E1g4nGvvg)]

Pitching from the front of the mound. Ball comes in low and out, but the batter was expecting something else, **Strike 1**. Loose form, almost like an infield throw. Rather unathletic looking for a cross-sport acquisition. Hat and glove. Always good to see someone making an effort. Lions could do better, but she's not a bad player. Only time will tell if she can rise to the challenge.

Grade: *D*

*I'll preface with the fact I'm biased* 
Pitching from the front of the mound. Shakes off the first call, obviously with a plan in mind. Hauls off and beans the batter, laughing at him like a hard ass. **Base on balls**. Dude had it coming. Form is a little too plain for recent Doosan acquisitions. I think this is a solid pick up for the Bears. I like a pitcher that can go out there and isn't afraid to hit a few batters. *Innuendo omitted*

Grade: *A++*

**Bomi Yoon** - *Apink/Taekwondoist* -&gt; *LG Twins*

[[GIF VERSION](https://gfycat.com/UnknownEnviousArcticfox)] [[YOUTUBE CLIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlZB5doMes)]

From the rubber. Pitches it hard with a slight spin away from the batter. **Strike 1** even if the batter didn't swing. Half-windup form, common with idol transfers these days. Ball comes off the outside part of her hand, giving it a running fastball curve, which has it end up on the outside edge of the plate. Her athleticism shines through this outing. LG seem to have picked up a good pitcher. Hopefully she won't get intimidated by the bigger sticks in the league.

Grade: *A++*

**Notes**

*  ""Rainbow"" is performed by Luna, Krystal, and Amber, as Victoria did not have time to learn to choreography. Thus, she only comes out of the end of the song when it's transitioning to ""Pretty Girl"".
* The choreography for ""Gangsta Boy"", ""ME+U"", ""Danger"", ""NU ABO"", ""Jet"", ""RPPP"", and ""Cash Me Out"" is still for 5 people, with KLAV (in ""Gangsta Boy"") or a backup dancer (the rest of the songs) taking Sulli's place in the formation. 
* They also still haven't figured out how to adapt the beginning of ""Electric Shock"" for 4 people, there's still a gap where Sulli should be in the beginning of the song. ""Red Light"" also had a few noticeable gaps during certain parts of the song as well.
* Sulli's voice is heard throughout the concert (though faintly), and whoever takes her part sings over her voice.
* The ""Step""/""Shake That Brass"" medley is actually: ""Step""/""STB""/""Step""
* The studio version of ""Paper Heart"" is used when the lights first dim.
* ""Cash Me Out"" uses the same choreography from 2013 that was seen on ""Go f(x)!""
* The only two title songs f(x) did not perform were ""Chu"" and ""Hot Summer""
* The choreography used for ""Airplane"" and ""Step"" is the same from the 2013 Winter Wonderland concert.

309,2016-2-5,2016,2,5,5,4473od,What makes someone a 'fan',malkavforever,1454616969,"Question for the general population.  At what point do you consider someone a 'fan' of a group?

For example:  I like Mamamoo.  I remember their stage names, but not their real ones.  I have loved all there work on Immortal Songs 2, but I have only liked there debut song enough to purchase.  Nothing after that enough to buy.

By contrast I like Gfriend.  I have bought a couple of their songs, watched them on some variety shows.  However, I can't tell you more then 2 of their stage names.

Similarly with AOA now that I think of it.  Own maybe 3 of their songs, saw them at a KCON fan meeting and concert, can only name half the members.

So, at what point does one become a 'fan' of the group?  When they like a song enough to buy it?  When they learn the members names?  Or is it from the moment they first hear a song they like?",28,0

But from what I've observed, there are fans who'll absolutely tear you down when you insinuate that their idol did something to their face.

I think they make the community hostile, and it makes KPop fans look bad in general.

Translation by [penguinwoozi](http://penguinwoozi.tumblr.com/)

1. **CARAT:** An existence that lets the diamonds called Seventeen shine. A carat is the mass unit of a gem, and the higher the number is the more its value increases. The fandom is likened to that, meaning that the more members bear the name (of Carat) the more Seventeens value will increase.

2. **Tinker Bell:** Seventeens existence is like Peter Pan from Wonderland, and by Peter Pans side, Tinkerbell is always with him, meaning that Seventeen and the fans will always be together.

3. **Tinvely:** The mix of the words Seventeen and lovely, meaning the lovely Seventeens lovely fans.

4. **Same:** The same, with the meaning of same, Seventeen and the fans are the same, meaning they love each other the same. It also reduces Seventeens chant Say the name! (the se in Seventeen and the im in sei deo neim reduce to make seim or same)

5. **Wish:** Meaning that the wish and dreams of Seventeen and fans of becoming one has been realized. There is also a connotation of meaning to keep important things like a wishlist.

6. **Wennie:** We Expect Novelty and Imagine Eternally (The new thing we are expecting and imagining without end). The saying written that has been reduced (We expect the new thing and think about it without end) (A/N idk how to translate it as elegantly..Im sorry)",64,74

We are also willing to offer a room and ride for you if you need somewhere to stay (thing is, we only have a king size bed, and there are three of us going, so you'd probably get a cot or something sorry). We're going to be staying in the city from the 12th thru the 15th, just so you know the timeframe.

- There are 12 Celebrity Judges and 87 Audience members who have votes.
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 12 Celebrity Judges and 87 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

This week's judges:

- Kim Gura
- Kim Hyung Seok
- Shin Bong Sun
- Kim Hyun Chul
- Yoo Young Seok
- Lee Yoon Seok
- Kim Heung Gook
- Yoo Hyun Sang
- Beast's Dongwoon
- Hong Yoon Hwa
- Twice's Nayeon
- Jo Jang Hyuk

Round 1 format: The two singers sing a duet, and the loser performs the song that they would have sang in the second round, while revealing themselves.

Also it might be because YouTube views hold more value than Facebook views? Facebook vids play automatically.

727,2016-2-12,2016,2,12,4,45aolb,I am planning a BIG BANG singalong video to celebrate the end of the MADE tour!,Nokisa,1455220027,"Hello, my name is Nogisa and I am here today to ask you guys if you would like to participate in a neat little project of mine.

There is a series of videos that exist on youtube called ""(Blank) sings"" or other varieties where people on message boards send in audio clips of themselves singing one song at the same time. Here are a few examples this style of video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LjhGNMOoEU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgPtxITnKag

and my personal favourite : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kji-0ceL5yY

Most of the genre are Anime exclusive and Memes but what if there was one for KPOP? Strangely that isn't really that popular enough to have a video like that. But I want to change that! 

Since BIGBANG is coming to an end soon I wanted the fans to gather together and sing one of their songs just in celebration for the success over the years. I want to use Bang Bang Bang because I feel like that would be a very fun song to sing along, and this is open to everyone, you do not need to have an amazing understanding or pronunciation of the language just grab a microphone and sing your hearts out! 

So what do you have to do? Well simply find the lyrics to BIGBANGS ""Bang Bang Bang"", grab a microphone, sing and send the audio file to NogisaBIGBANG@gmail.com with your name as the subject!

I really want this to become a thing  and I hope that many of you will look at this and want to participate, as of now the cut off date is March 1st, 2016 because I cannot think of a better time!

Thank you so much, and I hope to hear from you all soon!!!",5,18

I am watching BIGBANG WORLD TOUR MADE in JAPAN and i'm blown away after only 10 minutes. All of them have great skills, are now recognized as artists, but i tend to think that their biggest strength is their scenic presence and charisma when they perform live.

I had the chance to go to Korea for a whole semester and i went to a few shows. I loved all of the show i went to **But i am more amazed by the live i am watching whereas it is just a video** so i imagine the feelings audience could have during BIGBANG shows.

So, according to you (and maybe your experience, tell me if you had the opportunity to see artists performing live) which group is the best stage performer ?",28,0

Below is a list of 4K 60fps videos that were professionally produced with source material being shot in 4K. None of them are upscaled from a lower source, or are fancams. Not that I have anything against fancams; I just prefer the dynamic shots from official camera rigs.

833,2016-2-13,2016,2,13,16,45j7xx,Nostalgia with DBSK,Raw_Is_Jericho,1455347449,"I've been a long time fan of dbsk since 2005, when my mom and sister used to watch dramas and variety shows on tv. I never liked kpop but dbsk was always the exception. I never told anybody about it because I thought it was embarassing since I was a boy. Eventually I started to memorize a lot of their songs and even knew their fan chants (favorite being ). I was your typical straight A Korean student who took piano lessons and did taekwondo, but nobody could tell I was secretely fanboying over dbsk. I was never obsessed like one of those stereotypical korean fangirls but they were by far my favorite band. 

In 2007, when dbsk when on hiatus in korea to tour in japan, I was pretty disappointed because I couldn't see them on tv anymore. Every day I waited to see if they would come back but gave up after 2 months. At that point I just stopped caring and focused on school and my extracurricular activities. Little did I realize that they wouldn't make their comeback until almost 2 years later, and what a comeback it was. I found out my friends were talking about dbsk's new album and comeback. I was completely shocked since I had more or less forgotten about them. After waiting that whole time, I had high expectations for them and when I watched their first performance of mirotic I jumped. It was crazy how much they changed from 06 to 08. 

I ended up getting the album from my cousins in Korea as a christmas present after my mom found out I was a huge fan of dbsk and asked them if they could get it for me. You couldn't even imagine the smile on my face. As the months went by, my friends and I were busy planning for high school but in our free time, we would learn dbsk songs and the choreography. In a way, it introduced me to a lot of friends and we would have fun every Thursday after school just dancing and singing dbsk songs. It was definitely one of the funnest periods of my life.

Looking back, I think dbsk was the only kpop group I ever liked because they were all so unique and provided something that no other kpop group had at the time. I'm 21 now and don't listen to kpop anymore, but once in a while I like to go back and listen to dbsks old songs again for nostalgia. Its really unfortunate what occured later on to the group and sometimes I wonder if I would still be a fan, but none of that really matters anymore. I've moved on from dbsk but will always be grateful for the entertainment and the memories they gave me.",15,59

With another week of your participation, the Kpop B Songs playlist reached 86 songs (with 176 nominations). Keep it coming!

Here are the previous weeks' playlists.

**[\[Week 1 - Cheerful / Mood Lifting\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHg9jrbVhcXJ91Kq7T_jcfSP)**

**[\[Week 2 - Sad / Heartbroken\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjtCQvQftdB1M8FVTpm42Xc)**

**[\[Week 3 - Hip-Hop + R&amp;B\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjig_XDbMrLJYHvti36EuOi)**

**[\[Week 4 - Workout / Hype\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgZDiVNF4H5UOfGKLrF0wBE)**

**[\[Week 5 - Chill / Mellow\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgm_B9TZNM65v8RGOfcxs4a)**

**[\[Week 6 - Kpop B Songs\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjvLw3FXawz6JHSRrlVBDmB)**

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Driving &amp; Cruising. Nominate the songs you jam while driving your car, sedan, truck, or motorcycle (or regular cycle!). These can be the songs you yell out loud while alone, butchering the song completely but no one is in your car to hear you. 

Or the songs you like to listen on a long drive from different CONTINENTS. A song that you wouldn't hit next through your radio, that'll keep you awake through late night driving, and that makes you bounce in your car.

If you have any questions with the theme, feel free to pm me about it.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **(Sunday, February 21st, 11:59pm PST)**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

Feel free to PM me if you have any ideas for upcoming themes!

Upcoming themes are:

* Dance and Uptempo (Party!)

* Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs

* Electro / Futuristic Kpop

* Dark / Sinister

* Indie and Acoustic Sounding

* Sexy Time / Love Making

* Remixes

* Boy Groups / Girl Groups


----------

Vote more and nominate more! With more participation, the playlists get better.

My Japanese is atrocious, but the gist of it is that:

* there will be a meet and greet to promote the release.
* the DVD will cost 5,400 yen
* the Blu-ray will cost 6,480 yen
* both releases come with a bonus item (most likely a photobook, but  I'm not sure what the katakana says)

Anyone more experienced in reading Japanese able to translate it?

I'm assuming the concert setlist will be relatively the same as the korean setlist, though with the JP version of Danger replacing the Korean one and perhaps including the JP version of Hot Summer.

I know popular, long-standing groups such as SNSD, BIG BANG have immense popularity due to them being in the game for the longest time, but in the current Kpop scene, there are groups such as GFRIEND and TWICE that are garnering fans at significant rates while other groups such as FIESTAR and STELLAR have been going at it without much return.

The question I pose is that do groups have to come out with a hit song that will push them to the top? Or does an out of the ordinary event such as a viral fan cam help spread the word of their existence?Are groups' popularity largely dependant on their song styles and concept directions? I know that SNSD's 'You Think' is a great song and is on par with their other song 'Lion Heart' but locally it did not result in great success due to it not being liked as much by Koreans in relation to 'Lion Heart'.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter. If I came across as being biased in anyway I must apologise in advance. Thanks!",85,49

In the near future, i'm looking at going deeper at the popularity of the genre in both countries (once my arm heals, of course. Yes, this is being typed with one hand).

My question for you all is what more would you like to know about K-pop in either country? Love to hear from you all!

Maybe you know that your style of music fits perfectly with theirs, or that they consistently put out quality songs. Are there any artists that come to mind for you, and why?


Mine would definitely be Epik High/Tablo, Roy Kim, and Akdong Musician (despite only having released one album as of now), and possibly Eddy Kim and Royal Pirates. (And Dean, even though he hasn't released any albums. I trust that man already bc he's a genius)",128,41

Of course, Irene and Joy's hair could just be layered and Seulgi's hair an ombre but their past comebacks have always shown that a conscious effort is made with Red Velvet to make them all look similar to each other, so to have them all go short together at once makes sense. ",62,148

So I've recently gotten into Kpop (about a couple weeks now) and its def a departure from what I usually listen to (mostly hip hop/rap) and I'm really liking it.

Then I tried telling my friends about it (who are also hiphop fans) and their reaction was basically ""lol Kpop is shit tho"" (their reaction to pop in general really) or talk about how the only good things are the hot girls. I mean, I'm not gonna lie, everyone's attractive and all but I genuinely do enjoy the music. I showed some stuff they might like but they didn't seem interested and I didn't wanna push it. So I really don't talk about Kpop to anyone I know irl.

But hey, I found this sub so it's cool to have some place to talk about it.

Do you think the groups that didn't happen would have been popular or just another slot on one of the music shows? 

Groups I can think of:

 * JYP vocal group- Sistar's Hyorin, Secret's Jieun, Bestie's Uji and EXID's Hani could have debuted in JYP as a new vocal girl group before the groups plans were ultimately scrapped

 * [Five girls](https://thekpoprage.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/what-if-5-girls-02.jpg)- After school's Uee, Wonder Girls Yubin, SPICA Jiwon, G.Na,and Secret's Hyosung from what I've heard they still keep in contact with each other. The group did not debut because the company ran into financial trouble.

1245,2016-2-19,2016,2,19,15,46j8za,SM Global Auditions- Experience?,poutytaehyung,1455861833,"Yesterday was my audition in SF woohoo! I thought it would be really nerve wrecking and stuff but no it was kind of chill to be honest :-) So I had school yesterday and I could have left at 2:40 and get there around 3:30 BUT I had to go to a club election because I'm running .-. I knew at the fastest I would get to the audition venue at around 4:45 and I did get there, but they closed registrations. I asked some staff and she told me to talk to another girl. I talked to the other girl but the first girl had to translate. And yeah, they let me register! To be honest, I think they were just thinking, ""Whatever it's just one more person anyways. It won't take that much longer"" or something like that. So I got to audition even though I was like 4 hours late yay. They told me not to do it next time and I'm like yeah I won't, but tbh will there even be a next time? But anyways it was a really interesting experience. I saw my friend there and it got kind of awkward because I didn't want to tell anyone that I was auditioning, but I still talked to her. I only waited for around 1 hour and everybody else waited for at least 3. I felt really bad and embarrassed about being late so I kind of didn't want to look at the staff. They played so many music videos and it was actually really relaxing (to me). When I auditioned, I only had to audition with one other person and she was doing acting. It wasn't that bad considering there were only like four other people in the room. I messed up ^_^"" big time. I tried to play it off but I don't know since they kind of had that ""shocked"" look at me. Oops haha. But anyways, to be honest, it was a great experience! I really enjoyed it! I probably wouldn't be called back since I messed up and all + I was late but it was really fun! 
Well when I was leaving, I was going to take Uber, but I waited 20 min and the Uber driver NEVER CAME. I got really mad to be honest since it usually only takes 2 minutes -.- More on that later though. 
If you have questions, I can answer them! The ones about the auditions and stuff :-) Happy to give you some info about how it works or something.  ",33,5

I made a browser (Kpop) music streaming app based on YouTube. It's basically a media player for YouTube videos! I added some random/recent Kpop albums to test it out. 

You can visit it **[here](http://kpopper.co/)** (www.kpopper.co). It only works on desktop, since it's YouTube based.

I'd love to hear your feedback. I've only had some friends test it out yet. I'm really excited to see if you think this is something you'd use, considering it's not available on devices. There's so much more I can add!

Also, it's running on a really cheap server, so it might be a little slow at first.

EDIT: This is a prototype, so there's not much to it just yet (other than the basics) - so no search feature, etc",55,176

I just finished the sm global audition in nyc and was wondering if anyone has any questions or was interested in my experience. It should be prefaced that I was not asked to stay after my audition implying I did not go straight to the second round. Honestly I wasn't good. I'm also a male and 18 years old. I will post my face if anyone cares. I really messed up my singing and everyone sugarcoats their criticism so I was very disappointed in myself. Got there at 12:45 and waited till 5:30 to sing for about 45-90 seconds. Make a lot of friends because it's such a long wait. The people working are just students of New York university and they were really friendly. A few people were asked to stay after but I didn't get a good look at their faces. I will definitely try again for S.M and other companies but I need a lot of work. Because it's an audition the most important thing is nerves but I really messed that up. A lot of people are obviously just there to maybe meet their stars. Honestly they need to hide that better. If you are into pua check for age first cause some of these 16 year olds look so mature. There's a lot of interesting people to meet so just have fun.

Edit: I forgot to mention I am almost 100 percent chinese.

Or, if there was a K-pop Classics radio in the future, what songs do you think would be played on it?

Don't necessarily have to be lead singles. Just any song that you think will be so universally liked, or have enough of a legacy, that they might end up being classics?

 [Sooyoung announces on Instagram she's in Cali](http://imgur.com/D9Zi2Be) - always a suspicious location ... The number of people anticipating a slip up began here.  

 Sooyoung posts on Instagram with caption [""missing you""](http://imgur.com/dLM0jKD). With Jessica soon following with a picture of her also in Cali with the caption [""missing you too""](http://imgur.com/q4oZE0Q) - this piece of evidence is a bit weak and requires you to probably be a passenger of the ship Soosic to believe. But her being in Cali and Jessica looking to also be enjoying a day out in Cali increased suspicions. 

 The biggest piece of evidence so far is both of them being tagged in pictures among the same group of friends in the same location on the same day. Said pictures [1](http://imgur.com/zKvZJLS) [2](http://imgur.com/lN4RM2e) 

 And of course, due to the uproar, some of these pics have already been taken down. 

 So that's 3 out of 8 members so far I think that have linked in some way to be in contact with Jessica but I think this might be be the one with the best proof. ",86,134

The only thing that makes me happy right now is kpop. Even though this community can be toxic (fighting over your bias and what group is better) I'm still glad to be apart of it. I love watching old favorites and reminiscing, i love watching my favorite groups just slay. It makes me feel happy, and when my group comes out with a new song that slays I feel like im somehow apart of it. Its weird to explain, but if it werent for kpop i dont know how i would cope with life right now. Thank you!

I was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to get the opportunity to work at SM's Global Auditions in Chicago. 

This'll probably be pretty boring for the most part, but it might be nice for some of you to read what it's like to actually work at one of these types of things.

So first, our expected arrival time was 10 am. The two SM casting directors showed up at around 10:20. Not too bad. Some of the hopeful auditionees also started arriving around 10. Unfortunately they had to wait until 11:30 when we finally got set up.

Including myself, there was a total of 9 people working this audition, with 2 SM staff and 7 of us one day workers. Setting up the location for both the waiting room and the audition rooms didn't take too long, it was mostly just putting up banners, like this one (http://i.imgur.com/MmlEiBW.png) and this one (http://i.imgur.com/K9eHciF.jpg)

11:30 hits and we start letting people into the waiting room. At the end, the number of people who auditioned was 183, which really doesn't seem like a lot. Right, lots of parents who stayed to wait for their child. Also many auditionees from Wisconsin, saw a few from Michigan, and even one from New York (why didn't you go to the one in NYC?)

Really, there's not actually much that is terribly interesting about working the event. You just give directions for people to go to, tell them the rules about what they are meant to do during the audition:

- Singer must sing only the highlight (the part that they can best show off)
- Actors... Do whatever
- Dancers will freestyle to a song that the judges choose
- Models will walk up, pose, walk back, pose
- etc etc..

SM did buy us lunch and Starbucks though! Only time I'll ever be able to say that SM bought me a meal. They overbought though. $70 at Starbucks and $150 at Epicburger. Whatever, more food for me.

At the end of the audition day, which ended really early since it was scheduled to end at 7pm but it ended at 4pm, we started taking down the posters and banners. 

SM is so wasteful man. They threw away all of the posters and banners, and we had to cut them up so no one could take any. Of course, that didn't really stop me as I was able to hide a few away... but still... like this one that is now hanging in my room (http://i.imgur.com/JPgPtuC.jpg)

They paid $150 for what ended up being 6 hours of work. Thank you SM for my lunch money for the next few weeks.

Anyway, if you have any questions, ask away. I may or may not be able to answer them.",58,77

However, with so many girls it can get hard to keep track of everything; the rankings, the songs they sing, etc. So, I decided to stay up all night and create a spreadsheet with all of the data in once place so we can easily follow each girls' journey... as well as see how Mnet's broadcasting decisions have affected individual rankings. 

I hope this is as interesting to everyone as it was to me. Let me know what guys think!


**Data Sources/Explanations:**

* **Age** - Produce 101 Homepage Profiles (Technically everyone is a year older in Korean age now since the Lunar New Year has passed)
* **Training Time (Months)** - Produce 101 Homepage Profiles (I derived the times into months in order to have easily comparable data)
* **EP5 Rank** - Rankings from the Episode 5 reveal
* **EP5 Votes** - Total number of votes each girl received
* **Difference** - the vote difference between the girl and the girl ranked one below
* **EP3-4 Song/Team** - the song and team each girl performed. The green colored entries indicates the performances that aired in Episode 3. Red indicates that the performances were aired in Episode 4, the same day the online voting closed
* **EP3-4 Votes** - Total number of votes each girl received from the live studio audience
* **EP3-4 Votes (Adjusted)** - Votes adjusted to account for the extra 1000 votes for the winning teams
* **EP3-4 W/L** - Indicates whether the team won or lost the team challenge
* **EP3 Grade** - Grades the girls received after the Pick Me Re-evaluation
* **EP1-2 Grade** - Grades the girls received after the very first evaluation stage
* **EP1-2 Songs** - Songs the girls performed for the first evaluation stage. Green indicates performances that were broadcasted in Episodes 1-2. Red indicates performances that were not broadcasted (but were posted online on M.Nets homepage)

1695,2016-2-25,2016,2,25,18,47i2q2,Fan account of Taemin's first recording for his Press It album,ladauphine,1456391525,"**Skip to the next bold parts if you don't care about the fangirl aspect**

So M!Countdown really started the Press It promotions off with a bang. Tuesday night I was in my undies, tucked into bed refreshing the notice in hopes of seeing the fanchants for Press Your Number to pop up. Instead I saw the notice for the Drip Drop pre rec which was at 11 pm Wednesday night MEANING I COULD GO! I rarely get to go to Mnet cause of work, and it's easily the best. I started shouting to my Shawol roommate that she needed to put her clothes on and within 2 minutes we went from half asleep to out the door running full stop for the main road to catch a taxi. 

The notice had been up for an hour (a super long time for a SHINee notice) when we arrived at the Mnet building and we got our names on the list and sat around on the sidewalk while waiting to get our numbers confirming the list girls got our messages. This all happened from 10:30-11:30 pm and it was colder than a witches tit out there. I ended up being 78 on the list (a really high number), which is a miracle that resulted from the surprise early notice/the cold/the time. 

But, the notice told us that ALL FOUR versions of the album were required to get our usual ranking goodbye 70,000 won right off the bat. I ended up darting out of work early as possible Wednesday afternoon to get to IFC mall to buy the albums (and apply for a fansign, if I needed to buy so many may as well try for the fansign *if I get in I am going to have him sign it to ""ladauphine Noona"" because I have no shame clearly*). Then I ran to drop the extras and posters off at home and get my roommate. We rushed out and got to Digital Media City with 20 minutes to spare and wait for the check to start at 7 pm. It was already chilly and would only get colder. 

We got our numbers and sat in our two by two lines on the Mnet plaza, ate some kimbap, drank our massive coffees. SM check started at 9 so we had time to kill. Those are usually pretty quick and efficient, even for 300-500 girls, the staff have it down. That is, until they introduced the Odd Card. That added so many new rankings. Also the four albums didn't exactly speed it up. What normally takes an hour ish took the full two hours allotted and then some. There was a 300 person cap but about 450-500 showed. And I think they let most if not all of them in. 

Just after I got my number girls starred screeching and I looked up to the third floor window and saw Taemin standing there waving like a damn fool before running off out of sight. It was adorable. Manager just followed him and you could see him shaking his head and smiling. 

We finally got to go inside about 11:30. But they had us sitting on the second level landing, the stairs up to the third level (my spot) and the third floor landing. Here we waited for the next two hours. Most of the time the head Shawol staffer was running up and down the stairs DRILLING us on the fan chant. She was kept saying do you understand? I don't think you do, let's practice more and not just to the foreigners, to everyone, part of its rather complicated. She's an absolute goddess whom I adore, she deals with all the SM fandoms but her main charges are the Shawols (she is a Key stan in her mid-late twenties) and she is like our General. She expects a lot from us, but she works really hard to get us extras to make up for it. Mad respect for that girl. 

Around 12:30 we realized that Taemin had been worried about us when he saw us in the cold and knew we would be out there all night so he paid for snacks for us. A Capri Sun, snickers, and a Chocopie for each Shawol. I drank the juice, but saved the snickers and Chocopie to add to my growing collection of food I'll never eat cause memories. Sigh. 

Finally, at 1:30 am, we were slowly ushered in. We had to leave all our shit outside and were only allowed our lightsticks. Mnet is all standing so they try to pack us in tight. 

**Drip Drop recording fan account here.**

We walked in and rushed to pick our spot. Taemin was already in there watching the monitor of his rehearsal getting tips on where to look. The stage was gorgeous, all metallic with silvery tassel things hanging all over randomly. 

I had my fangirl boots on (black Docs that add a good two inches to my height, essential for Mnet) and could see Taemin's hair off to my left but I had chosen a spot dead center with nothing but shorties in front of me. This was a good decision. *though I have come to find out that because I chose this spot, I am exceptionally visible in the videos... joy*

Taemin finally came up on the stage and said his usual greetings. He was in all black, with a leather jacket and a white suspender pocket thingy he had in the video underneath. We screamed a lot and he laughed. We asked him if he'd slept and what he ate ( yes and he ate donkatsu), then he asked if we were okay from being outside. We all shouted yes, and he asked how long we'd been there, he guessed four or 5 hours and we lied and said like 3 hours( it was closer to 7 at that point). He asked if we got his gifts, and if we liked the chocopies. A chorus of NEs went up. He asked if we had actually ate them ( he said mokeosseo?) . Another chorus of NE. But me and the girl next to me shouted NE and immediately muttered anmokeosseo (essentially lol nope) under our breath. 

Finally he got into position with his dancers. The fog machine started and it rolled out really high at first and Taemin suddenly dropped down saying the line from Danger saracheyo saracheyo saracheyo saracheyo which is disappearing disappearing disappearing disappearing. Then he stood up and looked a bit embarrassed at himself. It was so cute. 

PD called for standby, and then for Shawols to shout. And then he started. I swear I'll never get used to seeing him dance and especially not so close (like 10 feet away?). He is like watching art. He's so incredible. The way he hits all of those small motions perfectly blows my mind. Also the way he goes from cutie Taeminnie to sexy dancing god Taemin  in like half second is really hard on the heart. I get whiplash from that shit I swear.

The fanchant for this is actually rather intense. In the chorus we do **Drip Drop neon** Han bangool sshik **Drip Drop deo** jeokshikoji **Drip Drop ee** eumak gatchi Drip Drop Drip Drop **ON ME**. Then we immediately launch into saying LEE TAEMIN over and over. No breath in between full the full instrumental part after each chorus. On the notice it just says say Lee Taemin x 00 aka infinity. Its like 15-20 times each instrumental. It's not easy lol. I did some rough math and for four takes that adds up to us shouting his name about 60 times a song and like 200 some times for the entire recording. 

Then there's that part in the rap after the first chorus. Even the Korean girls can't do it. It's so fast and in such a weird place, it's essentially impossible. So we pretty much decided to scream instead.

The first take was a half take, something fucked up with the pds. So he watched the monitor and came back for round two. Now I was front center, tall and very blonde. I was obvious, I got lots of eye contact all night, and while he was waiting on the pds he looked out and said there are many foreigners here. Lots of us don't know Korean, but even those of us who do were silent because we were so shocked that he mentioned us. The Korean girls NEd and giggled because we didn't really respond. 

 Taemin smiled really big and then said the smallest most timid Thank you in English I think I've ever heard. It was precious. I thought my heart was going to explode.

He ended up doing the song three full times. And our fanchants were strong and powerful and confident most if the Time. To the point that we oooood at ourselves listening to the monitor. But there were a couple of parts that were not. 

In the big dance solo at the end, Taemin humps the floor. That's what it is. It's the worst thing to happen to me in recent memory. And it's dead center of the like 20 ish LEE TAEMIN fanchanting at the end. And every time he did the move our chants either devolved to pure screaming or like the most desperate choked out version of his name you could imagine. I screamed the first time (perfect view each time jfc, bless tiny Korean girls) and managed to barely keep going the other times. I hope this distinction is audible in the broadcast *it was hehehe*. 

The other time was just after the floor hump, and I think cause the song was finishing he relaxed a bit and each time it's like the sound of us saying his name over and over just delighted him to his core and he smiled so big. We went apeshit each time he did it. It was wonderful. 

Before the last take he heard us coughing (if you're throat ain't raw you're doing it wrong) and he cutely pouted and rubbed his throat. And then he started doing a really weird owl like head bobbing to make us laugh. So cute and strange, much like him. 

Finally it ended and he kept smiling and spreading his arms wide as we screamed. We started to leave (it was 2:15 ish) and then we heard screams he came back and jumped on stage to wave a little bit more. He was so happy last night. Happy Taemin is one of the most beautiful things ever. 

It was a phenomenal recording. I'm so excited to see the broadcast. He was incredible and I kinda hope they do a behind the scenes of the recording cause it was just so nice. 

Also, I wasn't there bit a friend told me that during his pre rec for Soldier he realized that most of them couldn't have slept more than two hours do he said made a little hand pillow and said go to sleep in English. /dead 

No one did though, of course. No time to sleep. 

So yeah God I'm long winded. Sorry about that.

I'll edit the typos and for clarity when I get home. Doing long accounts on mobile is a bitch. Edits finished now. I switch tenses so much holy hell.",55,76

Personally, I like IKON a lot, but for some reason find Yunhyeong annoying. His singing style probably has to do with it. Chanwoo I don't particularly dislike but I still don't understand what he's adding to the group.

I'm wondering because I realized that for most groups I like a lot, I've actually ended up liking each member near equally, but for some there's just that one member... Am I the only one? 

EDIT: I really don't mean hate-dislike, I meant more that compared to the rest of the members you care a lot less or prefer them to not take the spotlight so you can see more of the other members. It could also be that you just haven't warmed up to a person as much as to the rest.",391,59

**Big Bang** have a full Japanese album later this year and a secret Korean project that people at YG won't talk about for some reason.

**iKon** will likely have two mini-albums this year, in both Korea and Japan with a Japanese concert (tour?) to finish the year. iKon's doing better than Big Bang did in terms of concert sales when comparing rookie years. People taking note of that too.

**New YG girl group,** don't quote me but I got this from a YG Business Strategy Dev associate.. debut in Fall/Winter. (But YG keep changing it)

**Winner** has a full album this year and two different mini releases, KR/JP. And two more concerts in Japan for each mini release.

Also, **2NE1** is penciled for 2016. Looking at the schedule, prob near end of year. Only two songs scheduled. Possibly a digital single.(same rumor from another 'insider' http://i.imgur.com/tXpTyXe.png +boms going to yg a lot +cls album is dropping soon)

**business** The biggest reason YG Plus is making losses is from overheads at HQ for their food business.  in Hongdae is doing well for them. in Hongdae is doing the best for YG Plus at the moment. Turns over around $5.5k per day at an operating margin of 20%. YG Entertainment put in a pretty good clause in their contract for Moonshot, meaning that they don't have to worry about stock/warehouse. Moonshot branding relaunch with G-Dragon as the main vehicle is set to start in March. New CEO is attempting to turn the loss-maker around. 


#YG change stuff so much and often, it's disgusting.

If some of you are interested, what would you pay for it?

PS. Solar &lt;3

EDIT: I've seen some interest for the shirts so I will find a supplier! I will first order a test sample to see if the quality is good with the print and shirt, then I will take orders. It will take me around 5-6 days to get the test sample and another 5-6 days to get the full order. Please PM me and I will order one for you! Or use the quickly made [website](http://oppashop.bigcartel.com/). Thank you for your patience! :)

1866,2016-2-27,2016,2,27,13,47t9ic,Discussion: The future of the Big 3 companies,Newdyjk,1456546829,"Brand  new to kpop and am so intrigued by the competition in this music industry....particularly by these big three entertainment companies:

* **SM: EXO, Girls Generation, Red Velvet, SHINee, Super Junior, F(X).**
Rumors are that SM has a bunch of new things planned but they also face controversy quite often and seem to be overworking the artists they know do well (Taeyeon, for example).  This is said to be SNSD's last year and people still question if their current reign as Nation's #1 girl group and popularity is dying out. They seem to need a successor but I read that the girl rookie talent isn't where company needs it to be to debut another girl group. (There was some article about why Yeri was added to RV so young and late but that she was the only one qualified. They also had controversy over the potential ""White fox"" group...and are noticeably not a part of Produce 101)





* **JYP:Wonder Girls, 2AM, 2PM, Miss A, Got7,  and Twice.**
JYP failed with huge sensations Wonder Girls &amp; Miss A....but now they have TWICE...who seem to be the group people think will replace SNSD when they retire.
TWICE has just started their career but their music video views and media exposure is incredibly high. JYP seem to have more promising rookies  as well...which leaves a lot of potential for their future.




* **YG: Big Bang, 2NE1, WINNER, iKON, CL, PSY.**
YG has huge talent that have reached massive success. PSY and CL are names that a lot of people over here are coming to know too. Honestly I don't know too much about them because I'm not a huge fan of their artists (except for 2NE1) 




Not to mention we have CUBE with Apink, 4minute, Beast and other companies with rising artists and hundreds of rookies that can easily be the next ""big thing""




What do you guys think? 




(*sorry if any of this is inaccurate...double checked my info but there's so much to know about each company that I could've gotten their top artists listed wrong or missed someone*)",45,4

1955,2016-2-29,2016,2,29,2,483xyb,[Fanaccount of D4 Nagoya] f(x)'s Last Concert In Their Japanese Tour,sq02,1456679367,"The venue was very small, didn't seem like a place where idols' hold concert at all. My seat was in the first row on the second floor and felt so lucky at first but when the concert started, the staff came over and told me I wasn't allowed to stand at the front row!! I literally screamed ""what noooooo!!!!"" to the staff's face. 

They were all so playful and cheerful today. They seemed more relaxed and played around with each other a lot. Luna was picking up more and more Japanese and was soooo cute when she was copying the interpreter and speaking Japanese like ""ha~i ha~i (ye~s ye~s)"". Lunber sounded like comedians at one point XD 

When lunber went to get changed, Jsj noticed Amber hiding at the back to scare krytoria and sneaked at the other side of the wall to scare her back. Jsj scared the shit out of Amber and said ""you can't trick me~"". then Amber said ""I hate you!"" In Japanese. Then Luna said ""you're boring/no fun"" in Korean and after hearing the interpreter she keep saying it in Japanese. Lulu is so cute! 

In the talk, Jsj said she ate hitsumabushi (eel rice bowl) for lunch today (squealed ""so delicious~"" in Japanese) and that she and Vic ate 3/4 of the 4 portion bowl the staff had prepared. Krytoria poking each other and laughing while this talk. then Amber interrupted ""what's more funny is that when I saw what's left in the bowl, all the eels were gone"" lol Poor lunber ate eel rice bowl without eels, which means only plane rice lol 
Amber ""I hate you! I hate you so much!"" (In Japanese)
Jsj ""we ate lots of eels so I'm full of energy!"" 
Vic ""I feel like I'm becoming an eel (walking around wiggling her body like a snake)"" lol'

Jsj ""lol We can keep on talking about food forever""

During ice cream, kryber (+Luna) faced each other and did a dorky dance leaning back and wiggling their bodies together (like how Amber dances when being dorky)
Jsj-Vic-Luna-Amber walked in a line at the end and they poked the butt of person in front lol

During Traveller, Amber gave a tight backhug on Jsj waist for good 5 sec.

When the intro of airplane started, I couldn't contain myself and went to the aisle on the back and started jumping but caught by the staff during BS*sobs. So I might have missed that hand holding moment when I was having a quarrel with the staff.
During BS Amber approached jsj and sang to each other's faces. 

During Papi, kryber walked to the left end and played around, Jsj pretended to slap ber. So much public violence lol

During Deja vu, kryber went to pick up the towels to throw at the fans. Amber probably thought she's gonna be slapped by it but instead jsj wiped Amber's sweat on her forehead with the towel. Amber looked so shy *squeals. With another towel, Amber wiped jsj sweat on her forehead. Fans who got those towels are sooo lucky!!

During so into you, they went around the audience and when jsj walked below me, she waved at our direction *waves fan crazy.

Towards the end of HS, Luna started crying seeing the crying fans. Amber hugged and comforted Luna and jsj laughed but wiped tears off her face with a tissue. When Luna was struggling to talk holding back her tears, jsj was watching her face from below really close lol.
Fans chanted ""daijyoubu~ (kenchana)"" to take responsibility for making her cry. 

In ending page, Luntoria was sidehugging and creating the world of their own as usual, and Amber kept approaching Krystal but Krystal tried to slap Amber (read on Twitter that Amber was making a heart with her fingers to jsj then OMG how could I miss it).
