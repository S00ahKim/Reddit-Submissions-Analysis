But I feel like JYP has really fallen off their game for a while now and is only living on their reputation alone. A rising company like Cube may take over. JYP's front runners are 2PM and Miss A, respectively, and 2PM has really regressed since their Heartbeat days and it's been a while since Miss A has done anything relevant (except Suzy will film commercials until the end of forever). Cube has (including A Cube and Cube DC) Beast and 4minute who are incredibly successful and Apink as a rising superstar. I'd say BTOB is about as popular as GOT7, as both are pretty mediocre, and it's safe to say Beast is more popular than 2PM with the way things are going. 4minute (plus HyunA) and Apink are both a lot more on the rise than Miss A. I'm not sure if JYP even cares about 2AM anymore and obviously even more so for the Wonder Girls (they're basically retired). What are your thoughts on JYP, do you think any of their older groups (2PM, 2AM, Miss A, Wonder Girls) can make themselves relevant again with a huge comeback, or maybe a fresher group like GOT7 will lead a new fan base? Or will they keep regressing and pave way for a new company to take the title as one of the ""Big 3?""",62,53

___

**UPDATE**
Translations, courtesy of a OH member - chickenfan, of the Baidu post that started this whole thing. Dumbass is apparently what the insider calls the CEO of SM... *Charming...* (but fitting!)

&gt;""He still wants to terminate his contract with dumbass, he rather pay the penalty fee but will not go to court. Perhaps this is too naive because dumbass will never let him get off that easy, he's still fighting for Luhan to come back, with the promise of making proper changes to his contract and let him participate in 1018 Shanghai SMT""
 
&gt;""It doesn't matter what dumbass does, it will not change the end result. There's no way he's going back. At this point, contract termination is a sure thing. He (Luhan) just doesn't want to get ugly, so he rather just pay the penalty and get out, he's pretty rich""
 
&gt;""His condition has been terrible recently, especially in the past few days. Vomiting, facial bloating, eyes are swollen, excessive tearing, passing out. He hasn't been able to eat any food since a few days ago. The doctors say he also has migraine"".

&gt;""Luhan gave dumbass until the 8th. If dumbass still does not address the issue publicly, Luhan will"".

&gt;""His mother has been by his side every day, she's in pain seeing her son like this. But with good rest, Luhan is expected to recover in about two weeks"".

&gt;""Luhan is very well connected. You shall see next month"" (I think OP is saying Luhan will not have trouble finding work after he leaves SM)""

**UPDATE#2**
Korean fansite for Luhan, *Luvely*, [closes down] (https://twitter.com/luvely900420/status/518035103176327168).

His tweets had initially targeted the CEO of SE Entertainment to be the source of the frustration and he later used more in order to call for action from fans and the public against his company and its allies (companies doing similar injustices and the media outlets who shield them, etc.).  I followed through most of the scandal, but after a few days it quickly quieted down.  

What do you think will become of him and the rest of ZE:A?  Nine Muses and the other acts in SE? Do you think he's being silenced or that he simply gave up his fight?  Do you think this will blow up further into something worse? Share your thoughts.",9,12

Thanks to some awesome people on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2e90rq/smtown_tokyo_tickets/) a bit more than a month ago, I was able to buy a ticket for SMTown in Tokyo! And I took photos! And I may or may not have snuck my camera into the concert! It's currently 3 in the morning in Japan so I'm going to go to sleep but I can answer any questions you guys have when I wake up. 

Fun observations I remember from the concert:  

* Overdose had some really ugly background shit  
edit: I do remember now that it began with tao being in the air in a ""helicopter"" and being shot, but that doesn't justify how terrible it looked with blood splattering around.
* MrMr's sound and background and all got cut off in the middle during Sunny's part and it at first seemed like a transition to another song or a capella of the song (which they were beginning to do) before it started working again a couple of seconds later.  
* Red Velvet was pretty well received, but they were labeled as *SM Rookies' Red Velvet*?    
* Stop shoving SM rookies down my throat SM",65,148

**DONT** stan their personal life counterparts. Don't dig deep into their personal lives, you may not like what you find.

You paint an image of your favorite idols based on how their company wants to present them. Their personal lives are not connected to their brand. 

I know an ex-physical trainer for JYPE circa 2008-2009 and the shit he's told me about certain idols from the company is really disheartening.

Something we all might forget is that whoever we stan for isn't necessarily who they are behind the scenes, and we tend to blur those lines a little bit then react appalled and flabbergasted when we find out something that might contradict what *we thought* they were like.^SNSD ^and ^Jessica ^for ^example

It's very weird seeing people call their idols by their birth names, but that's just me and my two cents.

Let me give you a back story, this guy's Twitter alias is kysadrian. He was rude to EunB's death on his twitter account and made two vines about it, I think. I think he made two pictures of him in the shower with his right hand on his left eye to represent Epicanthic fold and one where he is in the bathtub floor full with water but people in Twitter said it's about EunB's death. This is where the turning point begins, the **REAL ARIANA GRANDE** on Twitter blocked him on twitter because of him being rude to EunB's death; he made a tweet about him being p****, I think. The next day, someone emailed his school about it and I think you can tell from the third picture in the bottom. 

[His tweets about making fun of EunB's death.](http://i.imgur.com/wEsU7KA.jpg)


[Someone mentioned in Facebook about Ariana Grande blocking kysandrian on Twitter.](http://i.imgur.com/X133qXI.jpg)


[His last tweets on his account.](http://i.imgur.com/C6NOnm6.jpg)


His twitter account did get banned and deleted his two vines but made another one under [expresshunty](https://twitter.com/expresshunty) but after that, he hasn't been tweeting for the last few months. 
What do you guys think? Did he deserved this or is this too much?

**Note**: I got these pictures in twitter. ",4,0

So I'm a huge EXO fan/avid fanfiction reader, and I was wondering if you guys have any K-Pop fanfics you highly recommend? EXO fanfics are very much appreciated (and encouraged! :D), but you can always recommend those that center on other groups, too. As long as it's well-written and has your highest recommendations then why not, right? ;)


My favorites so far are *Anterograde Tomorrow* (Kaisoo) and * Like Smoke* (Taoris), mainly because by the end of the fic I was crying like^a^little^bitch lol. If you're an EXO fan who ships these otps then I very highly recommend them to you :)))",7,5

You could go through all those frames and not find an unflattering picture for any of those girls. But it's not just cause they're hot, but the camera operator is mimicing the draw of a human gaze as the camera pans in and out upon the girls faces and tilts the camera to an interesting/flattering angle. It's forcing you to put your eyes focused on these girls emoting faces, and the song is also literally telling you ""oppa/unni look at me please i have a miniskirt""

I found links finally, of me getting Taeyeon's Shirt. Apparently I got some hateful comments saying that I took that shirt from a little girl. 
1. You weren't there.
2. It was mostly 3 people I had to jump over
3. It was really crowed. 
4. Be jealous bitch.
How I got it:
If you guys were at Kcon you would notice at P1 there was a little ledge that separates P1 and P2. I boosted myself of the ledge and was able to jump over 3 people for that shirt ^^. Ps. I almost got a shirt from Suga but it bounced off my hands. ):

It just published [alleged screenshots](http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/k/2014-10-10/09024221628.shtml) of Luhan's complaint. 

EDIT 1: ""Luhan filed for a contract nullification against SME at 9AM KST"" - [Koreaboo's translation of the Sina report](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/99610745568/breaking-sina-reports-exo-m-luhan-is-filing-lawsuit)

EDIT 2: ""Luhan to be represented by lawyers of Kris and Hangeng"" - [Koreaboo](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/99612235453/breaking-luhan-will-be-represented-by-hangeng-and-kris) 

EDIT 3: [Lay's Weibo update:](http://fy-exo.com/post/99616190827) ""My dear friend, goodbye, lets perform again together if theres ever a chance. As a brother Ill support your every decision. Best wishes to you."" ^awwwww

EDIT 4: We just found out, and are not certain about the details. We never heard anything from Korea about Luhan having thoughts on termination from his contract. - SME's Chinese branch according to [Koreaboo](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/99620569083/breaking-sm-entertainments-chinese-branch-releases)

EDIT 5: Sina revealed 4 reasons for filing the lawsuit: 
&gt; 1. SM Entertainment is not able to give good future development plans for Luhan.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. There is a discrimination in terms of treatment between Korean and Chinese members
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The allocations of resources are not reasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Experiencing health issues due to over-exhaustion in both body and in stress. 

The artist is reported to have revealed, It is a working environment where it feels like [we are] robots in a factory. - [Koreaboo](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/99622166468/breaking-sina-reveals-luhans-4-reasons-for-filing)",391,268

And I realized besides being obsessed with with SNSD I don't actually have a great grasp of kpop. So I tried to scour youtube and just watch recommended videos. For reference [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCck8R8bxr2kPojhasLSFMIz_QI77bKm1) is the playlist I've been adding songs too. 

After this I came here to /r/kpop where I've been lurking/been posting some, for help and checked out the side post for ""New to K-pop"" but it didn't give that much info about finding new artists to listen to. So I wanted to ask, not just recommendations for new music, but is there any website or listing or something that has a history of kpop and famous songs I should know. 

Similarly if I someone were to ask me where to begin when it comes to something like anime or rock music I can tell that person some big things they should watch/listen to historically and what's good now and why.",28,31

433,2014-10-12,2014,10,12,4,2iytxx,"With the rumor of the other two Chinese members also looking at departing from EXO, what do you think of M line and it's potential fall? Also, how would you feel about having two new members added to save EXO-M and their promotions in China?",ricerain,1413055299,"&gt; A source has divulged a rumor to allkpop about the potential departure of the remaining Chinese members in EXO-M. This source previously revealed to us that Jessica would depart Girls' Generation and Luhan would file a suit against SM before they were made public. Because of the accuracy of his / her previous predictions, we have decided to publish this latest rumor.
&gt; 
&gt; Following Kris and Luhan's lawsuit with SM Entertainment, there is now a rumor spreading that the remaining two Chinese members of EXO-M will follow suit, sign on with the same Chinese entertainment agency, rebrand, and form a new boy group to promote in their home country.
&gt; Allegedly, Luhan's negotiations with SM Entertainment fell through, which is why he made his desired nullification of the contract known to the public. However, it appears that this might not be the end of it, which would continue one hectic year for SM Entertainment.
&gt; It appears that Tao and Lay, the remaining Chinese members, may hire on the same attorneys to handle their separation with SM Entertainment, so they can rejoin the others in China to form an entirely new group. Considering Kris is on the verge of signing on with Hwai Brothers, the three others may sign on as well, so that the Chinese agency is essentially taking artists trained and previously active with SM Entertainment and launching them as their own group in China.
&gt; 
&gt; This departure, however, is all dependent on whether SM Entertainment accommodates the remaining members requests, but we feel this is not so far fetched, especially due to the fact that SM Entertainment had stated, ""We believe there is someone behind the scenes who is pulling the strings.""
&gt; Lay so far has shown his support for Luhan's decision, calling him his ""brother"" and wanting to ""stand on stage together"" sometime in the future. He wrote on Weibo, ""Brother goodbye! If we have the chance let's stand on stage together again. As brothers, I support your every decision. Good luck."" What would be your thoughts if this turned out to be true?


If anyone is going to stir up trouble, it will be Allkpop. 

I'm curious to hear from those who aren't huge fans of EXO how this all seems on the outside and what would they would see to be best without such an emotional attachment to the members. As a huge fan of EXO I want to see what's best for the members but I also want EXO to be as whole as possible. However I can also see how putting two new members in or have Lay and Tao leave could be best for EXO in the long run. Super Junior had members added and they turned out fine so I don't see why SM wouldn't add trainees to EXO.",15,2

I was obviously very curious about seeing it and wondering if it was true so was basically wondering if there was any mention of those two together in China around that time that might back up it's validity? I didn't tear the page out the page like a crazed fan or anything but would love to know if it was them, especially as that was the page the book was open on, making me think they were there around the time I was.

It could just be fake but I thought it would be worth asking or showing for anyone interested.",6,0

Notice that picture was posted three days ago. OK. Seems like a normal quote, right?

But you add in these pictures, her Twitter biography sections, one from [August] (http://gyazo.com/fc08ec8b0c32fccc941dfac5a0157bd7) and another from [right now, this second] (http://gyazo.com/943f91bae460cbc2ba378717cb7afb2e). Spot something missing? OK. Now re-look at the picture and if that isn't making anything dawn on you, perhaps factor in CL's solo... and maybe you now agree that I don't think 2014 in K-Pop is done yet.... *panics*

 (, one time, one meeting) - The term is often translated as ""for this time only,"" ""never again,"" or ""one chance in a lifetime."" cr. [@inheaven_wjyj](https://twitter.com/inheaven_wJYJ/status/522983939393077249)


Edit: Resubmitted with new title as I am not sure whether the single is Japanese or not.

Edit #2: [Translation from @inheaven_wjyj](https://twitter.com/inheaven_wJYJ/status/522983425687293953) suggests Japanese single.

Edit #3: The article above has a mistake, ""Thanksgiving Live In Dome"" was held in 2010.",9,27

696,2014-10-18,2014,10,18,2,2jj9h3,[Story] BTS Concert: The Red Bullet - My experience,JV8,1413567655,"**Intro**

- Let me start off by saying that BTS is my favorite guy group so this post may seem a little bias but whatever

- This is also my first K-pop concert I've been to that features only 1 group so I can't really compare it or judge it which is why I won't call it a review.

- For the sake of whoever plans on going to the concert themselves on Saturday or Sunday, I'm going to try and not spoil anything. I will mention some songs here and there, but I wouldn't consider those spoilers. Things I won't spoil would be like the ending songs, or videos that play ect.

- Lastly and sadly, they didn't allow you to take pictures or videos inside the venue because they don't want people to post them online and spoil it for others who are going on a different day or for those who are going to watch it when it's online.

**Before the concert**

- Me and a group of friends got the place around 6:30ish and got our tickets. Since it seemed like most of the people there had already gotten their tickets and were waiting to get in, the line for retrieving the tickets was non-existence. That was kinda nice, but it also kinda sucked because we got their too late that we weren't able to buy any merchandise because apparently they stop selling them 2 hours before the event starts.

- After we got our tickets, we had to stand in line of our section for about 30 minutes. This has nothing to do with the venue itself, but I hate standing up for a long time while doing nothing so I was sad :(

- It was funny because when we were walking to our section line, people were giving me I wouldn't say weird looks, more like ""this guy is into BTS"" looks. Well, because I was like 1 out of maybe 4 other guys I saw there but mostly because I was a foreigner.

- At around 7, they escorted everyone into their respective sections.

**The venue**

- I'm only going to talk about this briefly since I don't wanna bore everyone. So the venue basically looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/a5Y21bK.jpg). We were in the standing section in the back. Even though we were in the back, we were only maybe 100 ft. away from the stage, maybe a bit more. There was also a section literally right above us, but I didn't feel like adding it in because I hate them for being able to stand :( Just kidding. Anyway, technically we had seat numbers, but once we got into our section, it was pretty much free-for-all. I decided to stand in the back near the guard rail because I was taller than most of the people there and I didn't wanna block their way, it made it easier for myself to see them, and most importantly it wasn't crowded and I had a lot of space to work with. I would say about half of my section was crowded towards the front, and then the other half had people scattered around, mostly by the guard rail like myself.

**The concert**

- The concert started off with a little intro with back-up dancers and a short video introducing the members by their real names. When the back-up dancers showed up, I was like ""huh, is that BTS, doesn't look anything like them"". Then the stage opens up and then BTS comes out and I was like ""oh, I'm retarded"".

- The first song they performed was N.O. and they started it off with a bang. It was unreal seeing them perform in real life after only ever watching performances through YouTube and such.

- As far as I can tell, they all performed without lipsyncing but they did sometimes have a backtrack which I honestly don't care about. They all sounded great.

- They performed all of their title songs. Not too surprising. It would've been kinda stupid if they didn't. I really liked all their performances with choreos. Oh who am I kidding, I liked all of the songs they performed. As for other songs, I'm pretty sure they performed almost all of the songs on their 2 latest full albums, a few from earlier albums, and special songs like Miss Right. I can't really remember but if you want to ask if a song was performed, I'd be happy to answer. I'm sure if you mention a song, I can say if they performed it or not.

- Some of the more memorable performances for me would first be Hip Hop Lover, mainly because it was one of my favorite songs from the D&amp;W album. There wasn't a choreo, it was pretty much them just running around the stage and doing their thing. It was really fun to watch, especially Jimin and Rap Mon who were getting really into it (I'll talk a little about the members later on). Second would be Rain and Let Me Know for the same reason as the last. This time however, they each had mic stands and standing on different sections of the stage. It was really nice and relaxing. The performance that caught me off guard the most was the Cypher Pt. 3. The hype was real. They got the whole crowd into it and they even got Supreme Boi to make a guest appearance. Everyone was so hype. Anyway, doesn't really need explaining but all of their title songs were top notch. I'll talk a little about their Just One Day performance later. I would write down everything, but I can't completely remember everything and I also don't want to spoil too much. Let's just say everything was great :D

- The concert plus the encore lasted about 2 and a half hours. This should give you an idea of how many songs they performed. Dat stamina tho.

**The members**

- I gotta give props to all the members, especially Rap Mon, Suga, and J-Hope who were pretty much on the stage the whole time except when they had to switch clothes or while a video played, for basically giving 100% effort 100% of the time. Their dancing was really on point and they didn't show any signs of slowing down towards the end either. They really looked like they were having fun and enjoying every second of it along with us. No one had the ""fuck this shit, I'm so done"" face at all.

- While all of them had great presence on stage and I applaud them for that, to me I think the most fun to watch were Rap Mon and Jimin. They really got into their parts and it showed. But like I said, each member had their moment.

- The one that impressed me the most however was J-Hope. I always considered Rap Mon and Suga to be the best rappers by far because they did underground work before, but damn, J-Hope can do lives incredibly well, both his rapping and his presence.

- Hmm, I'll call this the Panty Dropper Award. So during the introduction of each member and whenever a member was talking during breaks and such, the crowd would give a reaction and scream and whatnot. While for the most part the crowds reaction to each member were really close and about the same, I think the loudest would have to be for V. Don't quote me on that though, but it just seemed like he got the most reaction.

- A lot of people say that k-pop idols look different in person than in the MVs but I honestly thought that each member looked the same as they did through a screen. Hmm, I would say the best looking one to me was Jungkook, no homo.

- Oh one more thing, V kinda seemed like in his own little world sometimes lol

**The crowd**

- Korean crowds and fans like to get a lot of flack during concerts but I think I hit the jackpot with this. My section was nice; no one pushing, people watching what they were doing, no pushing and shoving, ect. This possible could be because people weren't able to record or take pictures, but whatever.

- Damn do Koreans love their groups and their songs. The screaming was unreal but tolerable and it didn't bother me. It was actually really nice hearing all the fanchants and fans singing along. One particular performance for Just One Day, during the whole chorus, the crowd was almost as loud as members it seemed. It was pretty awesome to hear.

**Closing thoughts**

- Was it worth it? Fuck yeah it was, I was not disappointed. Does this justify my reasoning of why they're my favorite guy group? Fuck yeah it does.

- I know this is a bit greedy, but I'm kinda sad they didn't do any fanservice like bringing fans up or throwing shit into the crowd (except in the very end where they threw like 1 thing).

- If you have a chance to see BTS live, definitely do so. They do not disappoint. They bring energy and it stays throughout the whole concert. And if you're going to the concert this weekend, you're in for a nice treat!

- I'm gonna spoiler tag this just in case others are going but in the end **SPOILER** since the unwritten rule is to have an encore ready, before they began performing again, a video rolled of just some memories throughout their career with BTS and some clips of predebut I think. It was really nice and the crowd sure loved it. After they performed their encore songs, a credits thing rolled. After it was done, I screened basically said to stay tuned for something. Can't exactly remember what it said but I'm sure it was a tease for an upcoming album or track.

**Stuff**

-  Let me know what you think of this story experience thing. Did you like it? Did you hate it? Just let me know, don't be too harsh though :3

- Since I'm going to be in Korea till the end of December, I may go to another concert, most likely a girl group (APINK PLS). Let me know if I should do one if it happens again.

- If you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability!

Anyway, thanks for reading this ridiculously long post about my experience at the BTS The Red Bullet concert. If I remember anything to write about, I'll try and edit stuff in. Hope you enjoyed!

The disadvantage of being an unknown and debuting is really a question of familiarity, most people don't know the artist, and unless the song is really catchy, the artist won't stick.  However, if someone competes in The Voice, that gives that artist a primetime spotlight for 10-12 weeks, as well as exposure and coaching to the biggest stars.  I feel like that would be a much better route to go.

This has happened for Tessanne Chin, who is a famous artist in Jamaica and won The Voice.",15,0

We wanted to get some feedback about the AMA, as well as who you'd like to see next. It's very tough to convince idols to do things so public and open like this, but /r/kpop really showed us there's nothing to worry about.

Thank you all for being polite, respectful and helping us to show that there are still new ways for fans to interact with their idols! Hopefully in the future, we can have them stay longer, answer more questions and be even more interactive. 

[MyMusicTaste](http://www.mymusictaste.com) and [Koreaboo](http://www.koreaboo.com) will be bringing a lot more AMA's in the coming months, so stay tuned! :)

I'm not kidding, if we combined all the tracks that Tukutz and I made, it would total over 100.**"" 
  

He went on, ""We made that many songs and **we cherry picked the 12 tracks that we really wanted our fans to hear** that was included in this album. I'm not being modest but I am really nervous."" 
  

Tablo then frankly revealed his thoughts on their comeback and said, ""It's really scary releasing something after two years, and **we received a lot of criticism for our seventh album, which is why I am very nervous about the response for this album.** I'm not even thinking about bad responses.  I am nervous about the fact that these were twelve songs people needed to hear,"" suggesting he was nervous about the statement they were trying to make more so than the criticism their music might receive.  He continued, ""I hope they'll like it.  I'm really nervous.  We worked really hard on it."" 
  

Mithra Jin added, ""**For the last five years, there was never a time my heart beat was as fast like it is now**, but my heart is starting to beat faster and faster as time goes by."" DJ Tukutz also revealed his thoughts on the comeback and said, ""I want to pretend like I'm not [nervous] but I can't help it.""

Billy Korean on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/gobillykorean), 'that white guy who teaches Korean'. I've posted here a couple of times before, and I'm a long-time lurker on Reddit.

This month I finished creating my new book, ""Korean Made Simple 2,"" the sequel to the first one which I made thanks to your help through Kickstarter. This new book has over 1,000 new vocabulary words, notes on Korean culture, food, and holidays, advanced notes for advanced learners, as well as extra appendix sections on idioms and additional reading practice.

You can check out the new book either through [my web site](http://www.gobillykorean.com/p/learn-korean-with-korean-made-simple.html) or directly on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Made-Simple-learning-language/dp/1502722216/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414284297&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=korean+made+simple), among others.

Knowing Korean has helped me a lot over the past 9 years, including being able to enjoy any form of Korean entertainment that I'd like (such as Korean music). If you're not studying Korean, I'd highly recommend starting.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, as well as any Korean questions, or also translating any Korean song lyrics.",22,32

1046,2014-10-28,2014,10,28,2,2khaof,The Controversy Surrounding EXO's D.O and f(x)'s Sulli,bluesea2327,1414430189,"Do you like EXO? Are there any fans of f(x)? Yeah, EXO and f(x) are the representative popular Kpop idol groups. Well, however, two members of the groups are caught up in controversy now. Let's talk about the controversy surrounding the two top kpop stars.

Did EXO Fans Disturb Reporters at the Premier of D.O's Film?

Recently, a premier of a film 'Cart' was held in Seoul. D.O has been cast in the film, and of course, the idol star attended the event. However, right before press conference, a furore was caused in the theater.

Some personnel for the event asked all the people sitting in the front seats to identify their themselves and asked them to leave the theater if they are not photo journalists. However, some of them were unyielding and didn't bet an eye. Because of this, the event was delayed.

At first, many people in the theater thought that they were fans of EXO who wanted to take shots for D.O. So, some of Korean entertainment journalists reported that EXO fans disturbed reporters at the premier of D.O's film.

But, it was not true that EXO fans made a disturbance at the event. The people who were sitting in the front seats as if they were real photo journalists were not EXO fans. They were merchandisers who sell Kpop idol stars' photos to make profits. 

Actually, in Korea, some have a bias against EXO fans. EXO is the most popular Kpop idol group, and people think that fans of EXO are blind with love of the group. Because of this, people sometimes assure that EXO fans must be thoughtless.

Of course it's not true, and at the premier, the EXO fans were polite and tried to do something for D.O. In front of the box office, the fans were all smiles and said hello to journalists, saying, ""Please take care of D.O."" They asked personnel for the event of they can get into the theater, but after taking no for the answer, they just waited outside the gate.
 
In a separate incident, D.O decided not to give a personal interview to journalists even though all the Korean actors who appear on upcoming movies usually meet journalists and talk about themselves. Do you know why D.O does not want to meet journalists? Well, f(x)'s Sulli is in the same situation.

Secretive Sulli

f(x)'s Sulli will appear on her film 'Fashion King' to be released on November 6. As I mentioned above, all the Korean actors who appear on upcoming movies usually meet journalists and talk about themselves. When the actors sign up for the movies, they sign contract for their public relations too. But, just like D.O did, Sulli decided not to give a personal interview to journalists.
 
As you know, it has been about 3 months since Sulli stopped her activities as a member of f(x) last July. At that time, SM entertainment announced, ""Sulli has been suffered from abusive comments and false rumors, and she is exhausted physically and mentally."" And at the same time, Sulli admitted to be in a romantic relationship with Dynamic Duo's Choiza.

If Sulli gives a personal interview to journalists, all the journalists would ask her about those, and that kind of thing will be pretty puzzling for her.

The situation is same for D.O. EXO's Luhan recently decided to leave the team, and all the journalists would ask D.O about the incident in the interviews. Furthermore, events, great and small, occurred in rapid succession in SM entertainment. Girls' Generation's Jessica left the group, while Super Junior's Sungmin announced he will marry musical actress Kim Sa Eun.
 
Actually, I can say it's not D.O or Sulli but SM who does not want to say something in front of journalists. SM might tell D.O and Sulli not to give a personal interview to journalists.

Oh, if there are big fans of Sulli and you are curious about her status, don't be worry. She's doing just fine. She and her boyfriend are hitting it off great.

1077,2014-10-29,2014,10,29,2,2kl89k,"Kpop Album Review: Epik High Knocks Down Beast, Gaeko and More",bluesea2327,1414518771,"Do you know Epik High's Tablo? Many of you many know of him because he's currently appearing on KBS' entertainment program 'Superman Come Back' and he's a member of YG family. However, some of you may not know that he's one of the greatest hip hop musicians in Korea because it has been so long since he released his new album.(even though he appeared on Mnet's 'Show me the money 3' as a hip hop producer)

Well, Epik High released its new album after 2 years of hiatus. The hip hop group, comprised of Tablo, Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz, recently gave an interview to Korean media outlets, and Tablo talked about their hiatus, ""During the period, Mithra has experienced a slump, and we were not able to release our new album because of our desires for a better album.""

It was worth it. Right after being released all the 12 tracks of Epik High's new album got the top spots on various online music charts. The songs even knocked down new songs released by popular Kpop idol group Beast(B2st) and Dynamic Duo's Gaeko, who is one of the most famous hip hop musicians.

The album's title is 'Shoebox'. Can you figure out what this means? Usually, when they go out to work in the morning, Korean people(I'm not sure about other cultures) say good bye to their family members right by a shoebox which is at a front door. And when they return home after finishing their work, they say hello to their family members right by a shoebox. Yeah, shoebox is a symbol of meeting and farewell, while Epik high wanted to give people comfort, courage, and hope.

The album has two title tracks, 'Happen Ending' and 'Spoiler'. Both of the songs have emotional melodies and lyrics, which are the important elements of hit songs these days.(In Korea, such a song is gaining great popularity among people)

Tablo, who certainly proved his outstanding ability as a rapper and hip hop producer through the two songs, talked about the songs this way, ""I think the two songs are just one song. I started to compose the songs two years ago when my father passed away. It was an enlightening experience. I had to part with him, and it was irretrievable.""

Some of you may think it's strange because 'Happen Ending' is solecistic. However, Happen Ending's 'Happen' doesn't mean 'Occur' in this case. The song's Korean title is ' '(Wasteful Ending), and the word '' is pronounced as 'Happen' in English. The song is about a man who repeats love and parting too often.

Have you watched the music video of 'Spoiler + Happen Ending'? In the music video, a pretty girl show off her innocent and pure charm. Do you know who she is? Yeah, she is YG's trainee Kim Jisoo who will make a debut as a member of the company's new girl group soon.

Big Bang's Taeyang was featured as a singer in 'Rich', while a English version of Taeyang's hit 'Eyes Nose Lips' is also included in the album. Through the two tracks, Taeyang, who is well known for his attractive voice and outstanding singing ability, proves his competence as a top Kpop idol vocalist.

And please do not miss 'Born Hater' too. Korean top rappers Beezino and Verbal Jint, and YG's rookie rappers B.I, Winner's Song Minho, and Bobby were featured as rappers in the song, while the lyrics are about haters who automatically blame the rappers. If you want to know about a real Korean hip hop, you've got to listen to this song. I'm certain that the 5 musicians, Tablo, Mithra, Beenzino, Verbal Jint, B.I, Song Minho, and Bobby, are top Korean rappers. You will be able to feel their rhymes and flows even if you can't understand the language.(DJ Tukutz composed and arranged the music)

Tablo said, ""I appeared on 'Show me the money 3' with B.I and Bobby. Especially, as a team, B.I and I had a long time journey together. Actually, we were the first to be eliminated from the tournament. B.I had so many haters in a short period of time. He reminded me of myself.(laugh) I though B.I should sing the hook of the song. And I think Bobby is really attractive and is a terrific rapper.""

Epik High will hold its exclusive concert 'Parade 2014' at the Blue Square Samsung Card Hall in Seoul from November 15-16.
