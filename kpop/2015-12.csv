We are a couple K-music fans building a new mobile streaming service for K-Pop and other K-Music    - link here: [www.doremi.fm](http://doremi.fm). We've been listening these tunes since 2006, and K-Pop was the mental anchor for us during the mundane / crazy 2-years in the army (Yoona kept us sane :). 
  
Now finally back to civilization &amp; currently studying in the US, we just wanted to have KPop on-the-go with us, and have decided to build a mobile app that streams K-music. We pulled together a few lists based on our personal favorites for everyone to enjoy, and have posted it on the preliminary site here - [www.doremi.fm](http://doremi.fm) (credit goes to /u/JomDarbert for sharing the initial codebase). 
  
Right now, as we are exploring different features, we just wanted to get input from **you** to make sure we build the best app that everyone will enjoy. We are looking for feedback in 2 areas:  
**- How is the current selection of music? What songs / artists / themes do you listen to?** We are actively creating playlists, but they are mostly based on our preferences, so we'd love to hear more.  
  
**- What features do you find useful?** Here are a few on our list right now (of course, suggest anything that might pop into your mind!): 
x) Playlist mixer - Have a playlist for EXO and VIXX? You can ""shuffle"" play between the two.
x) Discovery function - Explore new songs or re-discover old favorites by ways of playlist recommendations.
x) Subtitles - Providing English / Korean subtitles (karaoke-style).

Love it? Hate it? Let us know!

I was most hyped about SNSD's [Mr. Mr. Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uw5gudgWQA) and it delivered for me! Not the MV but the song and the performances for sure. (Definitely know this isn't a popular  opinion)

I was most let down by [Sistar's comeback image teaser](http://cdn.kpopfighting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SISTAR_1434327395_af_org.jpg) . I was expecting something different and more edgy. I'm also not a huge fan of ""Shake it""",48,24

1) ~~Temptastic~~   
2) ~~John Travolta Wannabe~~  
3) ~~Black Eyes~~

For those who dont know, Seventeens leader S.Coups tripped during their Mansae stage for MAMA yesterday. The [angle that Mnet filmed from](https://youtu.be/p075Bb-EcTU?t=3m50s) made it seem pretty straightforwardhe tripped and missed some linesbut watching fancams from other angles has made me realize how badly the whole thing could have gone. He nearly fell off the stage entirely, but reacted quickly enough to [jump onto a narrow platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE68bvYeXpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m6s) that was separate from the main stage. Heres [another fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQOIYEIuc3s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m8s).

Idk Im really impressed. He had a split second to realize his momentum was going to throw him off the stage and made the decision to jump. He could have missed the platform altogether and fallen off the stage during the biggest, most visible performance of Seventeens career thus far, but that didnt happen. Even though it was noticeable that he tripped and missed some lines, it could have been so much worse.

Then there are incidents like [Gfriends infamous Me Gustas Tu performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag2R7Mt8yI8). Even though I dont really know much about Gfriend, I respect the hell out of Yuju for getting up so many times.

So /r/kpop, what are some other good saves that averted disaster or displays of professionalism that gained your respect during live stages? I know there are some good stories out therenear misses with falling stage equipment, handling of fans who run onto the stage, etc. Please share!

**Edit:** WOW thanks guys, I didn't think this would get so many responses! Oftentimes you're not gonna notice these things unless it's a group that you already follow closely, so it was really fun to watch all the random fancams that I otherwise would have never come across and to better appreciate other people's favorite idols.

I'm concluding the 'giveaway' here.
  
I'm surprised at the sheer number of responses I got even for the albums that were not signed AOA. May luck be with those who didn't get anything this time. I *may* do another giveaway after New Years, or in a few months time should I find anything else I want to get rid of.  
  
To everyone who received your requests, congratulations. I'll start shipping them out this coming Monday and hopefully it'll reach people by Christmas. The next PM you receive from me shall be when I ship them out, so please don't send me anything else :)

Fan : A member of EXO posted on SNS about their daesang award and turns out the one they received is a Best Producer Award trophy. So it's a mistake, right?


Staff : Didn't they the one at fault for taking the wrong trophy when the award was delivered? Because usually the situation was so frantic at that time


Fan : Is there a chance that the trophy was handed wrongly?


Staff : If EXO received JYP trophy then they should've checked the label once they got off from the stage, then they could exchange the trophy backstage


Fan : So are you saying that this is not Mnet's fault?


Staff : Rather than it's because of our mistake, it could be that they were the one who took the wrong trophy, Beside, this is not a big issue and we don't receive any internal report regarding wrong trophy delivery. Actually, if you look at award ceremony, it's possible to receive the wrong award too. If EXO checked the trophy once they got off stage, they could exchange the trophy immediately tho

Also, if your wondering there is a difference between a singer and vocalist. You can judge a singer based on how they portray emotion and how good they sound, but vocalist judged on how they use their voice as an instrument.
I think, for female vocalists, Ailee, Hyorin, Raina, or U.ji. For male vocalists, Khyuhyun Ryeowook, and Sandeul. I chose only idols so that the choices would be more narrow, otherwise you'd have a hard time not choosing Kim So Hyang.

I've sorted through multiple butt-tons worth of releases from the past week and curated a playlist for your listening enjoyment. Same as last time, artists/songs that were posted on the subreddit won't be found here; the purpose of this post is to introduce you to songs/artists you likely would have never known about. However, if I found a song to be generally glanced-over by the subreddit but fits the overall playlist sound well I will stick it on at the end of the playlist. (This week's playlist is a lot less sonically cohesive than last week's though :/) 

To keep my own biased tastes out of the playlist as much as possible, I've chosen these songs based on the quality of the track rather than how much I enjoyed it. As a result, the genres of the playlist can be pretty varied. To help you all get right to the songs you'd like, I've included the genre next to each song title. Additionally, if I felt the official melon-listed genre did not fully capture the heart of the music, I included my own whack genre labeling as well after it. 

Without further ado, come pull up a chair and vibe out to this week's songs! Each song is linked into a set playlist, so to listen to them all in full just click the first link and enjoy~ If you're looking to listen straight through the playlist and would like less abrupt genre changes, I made an [alternative playlist]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyKSmNMhiHW-519xiMI-VBgREPzm-R1SK) that will hopefully ease you into those changes.

I'm big into fantasy football and I wanna combine that with my love for kpop.  Basically my idea is that we'd get a bunch of people to ""draft"" k-pop bands for 2016 so you'd have your roster for the year, and then based on the number of music show wins the bands you chose get during that year determines the winner.  Probably would have to be over the entire year rather than week to week match-ups.  No idea how I'd go about organizing it but wanted to see if there was interest.

EDIT: Also if anyone has any ideas of like, organization or wants to help me out with that hit me up, we can discuss.

EDIT 2: In an effort to actually get this going, please check out /r/fantasykpop! There's a thread up right now where we can discuss rules and how this will all go down.",63,165

336,2015-12-6,2015,12,6,12,3vma4u,The happiest performance of your idols,valdemaar,1449371353,"So im pretty sure we all notice after a while that everyone in kpop kinda half asses performances or just doesnt look as excited to perform. Of course there are some really extreme cases where people look straight up bored but i was wondering what is a moment that you recall of your idols being the happiest while performing? Im not really talking about performing a happy song, i hope that was clear lol. 

I guess what i mean is when do you think your idol was genuinely happy and not just ""oh god i have to hit this note"" or ""oh no im out of sync on this dance move""

To give a few examples: 

I have watched a lot (like a LOT) of Ailee fancams and i dont think ive ever seen her as happy as in this [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDNO_UMMCuM) of Dont leave me by JYP. The rest of the concert is also really entertaining, you can find it in the related videos. Also the live vocals were pretty good.

Another example is Davichi's Kang Min Kyung which is probably my favourite idol. They usually sing ballads which dont allow for much happiness, but even while singing happy songs i always get the feeling its just a show. [This performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0quHxL3UDUQ) of Love and War is probably where i remember her being genuinely happy.

394,2015-12-7,2015,12,7,8,3vpuih,"The controversial topic of ""breaking into the american market""",Appleyrice,1449443182,"Hello.. After reading [this](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-american-dream-takes-on-new-meaning.html) article on NB I would like to hear everyones opinions on what k-pop buisnesses are doing wrong and why they cannot be popular in america doing what they do now. This is just my opnion. I would like to hear what everyone thinks as well.

For me:

* Promotions

Promotions in america are not the same as in korea. Korea promotions consist of usually 1 song of the album. They will preform this song on music shows(which america does not have.) Promotions in america happen after a full album release(usually) and consist of country-wide tour in almost every state.

* Albums

There is not really such a thing as a ""Mini Album"" in america. We have EP's of sort.. but usually EP's are not really recognized like a full album. We don't have ""title songs"". ""Title Songs"" is usually 1 song that they promote in k-pop without promoting the entire album. 

* Dancing??

American music is not really associated with dancing at all. I laughed at Ariana Grandes attempt at dancing in some of her songs.. 

* Image

I don't find america to associate image with music often. K-pop industry relys heavily on Visuals and Dancing. Most people who listen to Billboard Top 100 probably don't even know the artist looks like unless they saw them on the news or in a magazine. I find that when ""attempting"" to break into the market they change their style of music. They shouldn't have to do that. Just make GOOD music.

* Radio

I feel like almost all top songs in america are played on the radio and become popular from the radio. A lot of artists I hear for the first time on the radio and their songs become a hit pretty fast.

* ""Companys""

K-pop artists usually do what the company tells them and a lot of artist have little or no say on their music. Even though a lot of american artist don't write their own music they usually have say in some of it. Record Labels in america are certainly not the same as in K-pop. K-pop companys seem very very restricting. 

Please post your thoughts.. I know this is a very controversal topic but I think a lot of Netizen are not aware of american music culture and always blame the race card. 

TL;DR. Groups trying to break into the market cannot do the same things as they do in korea.

So far I've included SMTown's 2011 Winter Album - The Warmest Gift, Got 7's MAD Winter Edition, and SNSD-TTS' Dear Santa in the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdFuNPUhnl4ChOuK8J9nbmyQyqQ-W2sI). I'll also add in SMTown's newest winter album once it releases later this month.

Comment below with a link to one of your favorite holiday songs and I'll add it to the playlist too. Happy Holidays!

Edit 1: grammar

Edit 2: Added EXO's Miracles in December and December 2014 - The Winter's Tale (I've listened to these songs so much in my relaxing kpop playlist)

Edit 3: Just finished adding in all of the songs up to this point and we're at a total of 67! Great job everyone; Let's see if we can get to 100 next!",39,64

They debuted with their concert series, [2PM - First Contact In Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WuyxTBpdL8&amp;feature=youtu.be), and have since achieved many accomplishments, including 4 studio albums, 10 singles with 8 certified Gold, and 7 concert tours with 79 total concerts performed in Japan. They have received professional and critical acclaim for their efforts in Japan, including by [Ranking Box](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/12/2pms-junk-ranks-in-top-10-best-concerts-in-japan-by-ranking-box) and [Tahara Akio](https://www.reddit.com/r/2PM/comments/3u62pg/must_read_151106151108_tahara_akio_official_line/) (photographer and interviewer for the magazine ""Shukan Josei."")

Three members (Jun.K, Wooyoung, and Junho) have also held successful solo promotions and tours, all self-composed and produced. Chansung has also starred in the new movie ""Wasureyuki"" as well as a side character in the Japanese drama ""Kaito Royale,"" showcasing his skills as an actor and fluency in Japanese.

They've definitely worked hard in Japan for the last five years! Congratulations, 2PM!",0,20

751,2015-12-12,2015,12,12,17,3wht8q,BTS - Boy In Luv (Draft),xero_01,1449909348,"For those that don't want to visit koreaboo.....

""Do you love hearing the original versions of songs  before theyre polished and remixed by label producers? Well, BTS fans have just made a fantastic discovery.

We received a tip that there was another version of BTSs Boy in Luv  revealed through the choreography video of a group of dancers performing an earlier draft of the slick moves the song is known for. This choreography video was uploaded on December 18, 2013, whereas the final music video for the song was released February 11, 2014 and there are a lot of differences between the two versions.

From our first listen, the original Boy In Luv had a much edgier feel, with more of Rap Monsters husky voice and a louder chorus. The choreography matches this original version as well  with even more tough guy moves than the original, if thats possible.

You can tell that the song being used is a demo from the random voice that appears periodically (sort of like an audio watermark)  added to keep the song from being leaked early. But, as long as you dont let it shock you you can still enjoy this new (old?) version of Boy in Luv!""

[removed: link]

Personally i think it's interesting to hear different drafts of songs and to see the drafts of choreography. What do you guys think? 

Update 1: Oh man my bad. Like a redditor (u/LineArk_) said below, it was a soompi article not koreaboo.

Here's the link to the article itself
http://www.soompi.com/2015/12/11/bts-fans-uncover-the-original-version-of-boy-in-luv/

Unfortunately i couldn't find another link to the video, sorry guys :(

Update 2: Thanks to u/LULUTRON and u/SenpaiDoesntLikeYou for another link to the video

Below are some songs that never made their way onto the subreddit but I believe are still worth checking out. Sorry Im posting this later than normal (Ive been aiming for midnight KST on Saturdays), Ive been bogged down in my last week of assignments and didnt get a chance to go through all the new releases until just this morning. As a result, a song really had to grab me right away this time or it didnt make the list (which apparently made for more songs than normal &gt;&lt;). I reposted Sanchez and Microdots song because the one uploaded to reddit was a fine mound of ground poopies. I also broke the rule I made for myself last week and included a Christmas songit made me happy though so whatever heheh. Hope you all enjoy!

I think that these are some of the things that make kpop as a genre distinct from American (or British for that matter) pop.

1.) I grew up in the 80s (yeah, I'm old), went to high school in the 90s, and to me kpop in many ways reminds me of pop music from the mid to late 90s and early 2000s. It feels like much of it is designed for the club with heavy bass lines and lots of electronic sounds to keep things interesting and danceable. Having said that, kpop doesn't seem to oversaturate the songs with synths, and the variety of electronic and other sounds they use is way beyond what was used in the 90s.

2.) Part of what makes kpop feel very 90s/early 2000s to me is the large number of boy and girl groups. American pop music doesn't really do that anymore. Music arranged and composed for five or more voices ends up coming across much different than music which was arranged and composed for maybe a lead singer on guitar or piano and some backing vocals. 

3.) I don't know why, but the sound production in kpop generally feels much higher to me than the sound production in American pop music. I don't know if that's because in Western musical culture the emphasis is on personal creativity and so artists end up using equipment that's not quite as good? While in the kpop world that doesn't matter so much and the entertainment companies can afford to have the best recording equipment on hand for all of their artists and do it in house, rather than have the artists go just wherever to do it?

4.) The emphasis on rap &amp; hip-hop is definitely something that separates kpop from western pop music. Almost every group will have a rapper and most kpop songs will have some rapping in them. Some groups do this better than others, but it's ubiquitous. In western pop music there's not much crossover between the pop world and the rap/hip hop world and those that do crossover (e.g. Macklemore) tend to not have much respect (though I guess the same is true for the idol rappers and the underground rapper scene in Korea).

5.) Speaking of production, it seems to me that generally speaking the production value on kpop music videos is higher than that of western pop videos. Stylistically I think Korean pop music videos tend to have much more going on in them than do western ones and I think there's more value placed on the music videos by both fans and artists in kpop than in western pop music.

Thoughts? Are my ideas completely screwed up? Any other trends or tendencies about K-pop music that separate it from western pop music (other than the language of course)?",121,108

The aesthetic for their first ever comeback has been amazing (and consistent), from the teasers, to the [MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk), choreography, song, outfits, and even the physical album. It's set up like a [storybook](http://i.imgur.com/4eqxfM4.jpg) with [beautiful photos](http://i.imgur.com/huLfZ29.jpg), and the even the [photocards](http://i.imgur.com/SFUXfEO.jpg) fit the theme.

**Seventeen - 17 Carat** - Their debut album, packaged pretty unconventionally. The box is a square, looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/X18gHaw.jpg). Looks like metal in that pic but in reality it's cheap cardboard. Inside it is a large poster featuring the members, lyrics, and such, all folded origami style so the zigzaggy blue pattern peeks through the openings of the box. It's a bitch to get back in the box, but impressive nonetheless. [This blog post](http://www.aminoapps.com/page/k-pop/7416302/i-seventeen-17-carat) summarizes the packaging well. The best part about the album is that it comes with 13 LARGE photocards, one of two possible sets. I wish some of my fave girl groups would bless me so. (a word of warning, it WILL be dented when you get it :( )

**Seventeen - Boys Be** - This group really spoils its fans. This album comes in two editions, ""Hide"" and ""Seek."" Each come with equally huge amounts of content, including multiple large high-quality photocards, a big poster/map/collage thing, a member photocard, a CD (in a sleeve!), a photobook, and STICKERS, for some reason. And the poster, photos, etc are totally different for the two versions. See [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/28955a19202550ee9510a40d8e31a903/tumblr_nuk3m35Fin1r3lxrpo1_1280.jpg) pic for an idea. [[source](http://verseols.tumblr.com/post/129029747229/seokmint-boys-be-hide-seek-ver-cr)]

**f(x) - 4 Walls** - Nothing can really ever top [Pink Tape's](http://media.tumblr.com/96cb891b4774ebfccd8eba15e6e941b3/tumblr_inline_mqj8opV4Dh1qz4rgp.png) beautiful VHS, but 4 Walls doesn't lack in style either. It's not really unique in terms of packaging but it's got this weird Ikea motif that only f(x) could pull off so well. Pics: [1](http://kpoptown.com/shop298397/cd/fx-4th_4walls.jpg), [2](http://kpoptown.com/shop298397/cd/fx-4th_4walls_2.jpg), [3](http://kpoptown.com/shop298397/cd/fx-4th_4walls_3.jpg). 

**Honorable mentions**: [Shinee - Odd](http://i.imgur.com/L4CIZe3.jpg), AOA's sports trading (photo)cards - [here](http://upload.enewsworld.net/News/Contents/20150611/85211508.jpg) and [here](http://upload.enewsworld.net/News/Contents/20150611/37759532.jpg), [EXO - Exodus](http://cdn.koreaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EXO_EXODUSImageViewerEShop.jpg) (not even Wolf could crush their aesthetic). 

**Honorable honorable mention**: [Super Junior - Magic](http://d23mdu6au44x93.cloudfront.net/32998-37937-thickbox/super-junior-special-album-part2-magic-.jpg), because SM spent all their money on everyone else this year.

I'll start off with how my own turned out:

- Big Bang returns. **Boy, did they ever! I'm still upset I missed their concert in Toronto :(**
- Brown Eyed Girls return. **With a fantastic album, I'm still jamming to Brave New World. Gain's comeback was also amazing.**
- Red Velvet will be on the rise. **I feel like this is definitely true. I didn't see Yeri coming, but The Red is probably my favourite album of the year.**
- SNSD will unfortunately be on the decline. If they release a next single, I'm sure it will get lots of attention, but be ultimately met with mixed reviews. **CMIYC was definitely a decline, at least based on the reactions here. I think it's still mixed, but with all the promoting they've done, and Lion Heart/Taeyeon's solo/TTS, it's probably safe to say they're holding ground!**
 - (Jessica hopefully reconnects with members again, even if she stays out of SNSD)**(Maybe not, but Jessica solo coming soon!)**
- CL has a successful US debut! **....come on YG, stop teasing it. US debut, 2ne1 comeback, give us something.**
- Groups like Spica and C-Clown get more attention. **Sigh...I couldn't be more wrong with this one, hopefully I didn't curse them. C-Clown disbanded, and barely a word from Spica all year, please have a comeback soon :(**
- After School returns, but so will Orange Caramel (and probably more than once). **Wrong again..they had the final song for Jooyeon, and that's it. Raina's solo is coming soon though! And on the bright side, we got Seventeen, one of my favourite debuts of the year!**
- Kara has a very successful year, after being rejuvenated by Youngji. **It's hard to say if it's a ""successful year"" but come on, who doesn't love Youngji, honestly.** 
- Shinee loses a member (hopefully not). **Praise SM, or Seungri, or the Red God, that the curse stopped taking SM members from groups. (Sulli was kind of already gone).**
- T-ara continues to not care what people say. **There hasn't been any new drama, but probably true lol.**
- SMTown comes to Canada (please!) **Pleaaase, I'm still waiting.**

And my ""crazy"" predictions:

- Kibum returns to Super Junior. **There's less promoting members than ever right now.**
- 4minute breaks up. **On the contrary, releasing one of the best tracks of the year. Also find it funny that I posted this under ""crazy predictions"", before they released Crazy!**


How accurate were your predictions, /r/kpop? And sorry, /u/chocolatesandwiches, still no #1's for Chad Future :P 

PS. Since people are asking, I can post a 2016 prediction thread soon before the end of the year, so hold on to your guesses! Thanks for being my favourite subreddit, [you guys are the best!](http://i.imgur.com/mQzqysg.gif)",53,91

&amp;nbsp;

So for some time now I have been curating a Kpop Simulcast. Recently we've done some updating to it and I would like to share it with you guys because I think some of you will like it and it would nice to have some feedback on any features you would like to see.

&amp;nbsp;

[HallyuNoonaTV](https://hallyunoona.com/hallyunoonatv/) now has 6 channels that can be switched between with a 'TV Guide' on the bottom of the page. The current channels are: Megamix, New Releases, Ballads, Hip-hop/R&amp;B, Rock/Alt and Festive songs. 

&amp;nbsp;

All the songs are updated and shuffled at least once a week (usually a few times a week) and everyone tuning in to a channel sees the same thing as anyone else watching that channel, plus or minus a few seconds!

&amp;nbsp;

If you have any recommendations for other channels you would like to see please let me know here or e-mail contact@hallyunoona.com and we will see what we can do!

&amp;nbsp;

While I'm here, you might also like our three podcast/radio shows each week. I do a show for [Southwaves Radio](http://southwavesradio.co.uk/) and we [upload a copy](https://hallyunoona.com/hallyunoonaradio/), a very self indulgent [Top40 chart](https://hallyunoona.com/hallyunoona-chart-show/) and a general [K-Pop show](https://hallyunoona.com/hallyunoona-weekend-round-up/).

&amp;nbsp;

Feedback on what you would like to see for either of these features (or anything else) would be very welcome and my apologies if this isn't of any interest to you!

But I was wondering what groups/song you thought went somewhat unnoticed this year (or didn't get the recognition you thought it deserved), or even last year below I will list some of mine.

**[ASTRO - Innocent Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4oi5pze_Lg)** - Okay, so, this is probably not underrated as this group hasn't even debuted yet, but I really like this group, so wanted to share with you all their cute song from their drama ""To be continued!""

Now the real list starts!

**[B2ST - Hands Up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz8ULSMUaIg)** - Personally I thought this song brought a nice refreshing beat and had me singing along for days.

**[ BIGFLO - Obliviate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEtpfu_ro6E) 
[ BIGFLO - Delilah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKKJ5N0soRk)** - BIGFLO are a group I quite like, and I feel are quite unappreciated, but that might just be my personal taste, they have quite a husky (?) low tone which I personally quite enjoy.

**[HIGH4 - DOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJBoTu_gogk)** - Okay, so perhaps not so underrated, but a song I really enjoyed nonetheless! I feel these guys deserve some more love!~

**[KIXS - Beautiful ft. San.E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ29X5Dwang)** - DALMATION's Jeesu's solo debut with this chill and catchy song was one that I really enjoyed!

**[K-MUCH - Tie my hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtMItMUPEbE)** - Another group I really enjoy that I wish were more well-known, again, quite nice and chill and very enjoyable to listen to!

**[Standing Egg - Starry night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2uSCayVWJo)** - Standing Egg are an indie acoustic pop trio that have some of the nicest, slowest songs I listen to, and a lot of really nice instrumentals. 

**[ SoReal -  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8djoUjR4oU)** - A slow song and an emotional MV, these boys are so sweet, and I find it a little sad they have under 20k views on an MV that's nearly a year old!

**[Snuper - Shall We Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB6eX7Lc2CY)** - Maybe not so underrated, but a new group none the less, so shower them with love!

**[ZEST - My All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsAheEb2XIs)
[ZEST - Last night story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UtpWl-3o9I)** - I chose these two songs because I felt it showed not only their cute and sweet side and also their manly side. A group I really enjoy.

**[HEART B - Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlFjWpzVfag)** - Again, another emotional slow song, I really enjoy listening to this groups music and would definitely not mind if they had a few more views on their lovely videos!

**[HALO - SURPRISE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aEl6jiUyOc)** - Thought I would end my list with a very happy pop-py song from HALO!

I hope you all thought this list was reasonable and maybe you even just found your new favourite through it! Please post your underrated songs/artists down below!",58,56

Everyone's seemed to enjoy the last two years of prediction threads, and a number of people were looking forward to another one for next year. So now, with just under 2 weeks left, what are everyone's guesses on what will happen in K-Pop next year? I'll start us off with my own:

* SNSD-SHY debuts! Full group releases 4th Japan album

* SNSD Sunny returns to variety yet again, now that shes free from radio

* 2NE1 returns after CL's US debut (if that ever happens)

* Red Velvet releases a ""Velvet"" album of smoother songs, and their popularity continues to explode

* 9Muses win a music show

* Youkyung appears with AOA again, in one form or another

* Spica and After School come back pleeease

* Twice will be huge; Lovelyz, G-friend and Oh My Girl continue to get more and more popular

* More love for Crayon Pop and Laboum

* EXID continues their win streak

* Rainbow splits up (hopefully not)

* Ladies Code releases new music

* Fiestar wins on a music show, after Yezi's new popularity

* Wonder Girls drop a new album, continuing the band concept

* Block B returns

* Troublemaker releases a 3rd album

* EXO goes a year without losing a member

* Seventeen wins on a music show, not once, but twice

* Day6 releases just one album

* Return of JJ Project as a GOT7 subunit

* SM boy group debuts and does better than iKon

* Another SuJu member gets married

* SMTown comes to Toronto (I'll post this every year damn it)",196,152

When they sing it really resonates, something that is hard to find all over in the K-pop industry. Though it's expanding and we get to see a whole lot more talent.

I personally enjoyed the song and I can see why people wouldn't but it is a great song to break into the US market. I just don't get why people keep bashing others for not liking it. I agree sometimes the hate is a bit much but the critics are usually the loudest and besides, music is completely subjective so people are gonna have differing thoughts on it, not a big deal. If you don't like it, you don't like it. If you do, you do, not a big deal.

At the end of the day, you can like it or hate it but kpop fans(who comprise a very small amount overall) opinions don't really matter. If the general public likes it, it'll do well and hopefully open up the gates for more artists to come over. As much as I like Hello Bitches, I'd much rather songs like **The Chaser** or **Ice Cream Cake** do well, kinds of songs that aren't really mainstream in the US and are more interesting to listen to.

Like Google, MelOn also offer rankings and lists of search trends, but they take a step further with this feature by adding demographic statistics.  

Search trends on MelOn are organized in different categories:  

* [**Real-time Rankings**](http://www.melon.com/search/trend/index.htm) / [*Visual Guide*](http://i.imgur.com/YA0Tu4m.jpg)

* [**Rankings by Category**](http://www.melon.com/search/cate/index.htm) / [*Visual Guide*](http://i.imgur.com/jCl4NEs.jpg)

^ I provided visual guides for the respective pages to help with navigation and to tell you what you are looking at.  Note that you can select and deselect the age groups next to the pie chart.  This allows you to compare specific age groups.  I wished these changes would have reflected on the gender percentages though.  Also, keep in mind that these are search trends and not ""how many times people played *said* songs"".  It's still interesting to see what people have been searching for on Korea's largest digital music streaming service.  ",3,12

Would love to get some more ideas to add to the collection.",minabruins,1450962777,"I saw people doing these on a different subreddit and I figured I should do some of my own. A lot of these are based on doppelgnger discussions I've found on forums/Youtube. I follow mostly girl groups so I apologize that a majority of them are female idols.

If you guys have some ideas/feedback I can use, I'd appreciate it!

**EDIT: I have added a couple of more that I liked from this thread. Tzuyu is also Eevee now.**

The tickets are in the Orchestra Right Center section, Row Z, seats 206-208. I'd prefer selling all three of them together, but if you only want one or two that's fine too!

I'm selling them at face value $144 ($125 for the ticket+ $19 I had to pay in fees). However I really want to get these off of my hands so I'll also be accepting reasonable offers. 

These are e-tickets, so once I receive the payment I'll promptly email you the tickets so you can print them at home.

It was kind of a shot in the dark, but I was randomly curious about Cheska and her current whereabouts and what she's been doing so I sent her a message asking if she could answer a few questions from the Reddit community. She agreed:

&amp;nbsp;

Please let me know what you'd like me to include in my informal quasi-interview and I'll be sure to forward it to her. I plan to send her the questions on Monday afternoon EST so I guess cut-off would be around Monday morning.


Also refer to this interview and make sure you're not asking a question that has already been answered here:

Thanks all :)

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: 20151226 @ 23:16PM - Asked her for a proof photo. Awaiting her response.

Edit #2: 20151227 @  01:59AM - Replied and said she will send me a proof photo.

Edit #3: 20151227 @ 03:25AM - Extended the deadline to Friday morning EST to give people more time to see this and submit questions. Also to give her more time to send a proof photo as I'm definitely not going to pester her about it. I have also linked a previous interview in the post.

Edit #4: 20151229 @ 13:09PM - Per a [conversation this morning](http://i.imgur.com/jo6NkvN.png), she's been busy with work but she'll try to take a proof pic tomorrow.

Edit#5: 20150101 @ 3:08AM - Due to the holidays it took a bit to get a proof photo but she was finally able to get it up on her Instagram. Hope it'll do. I'll also extend the deadline again to Monday morning EST as I'm sure people hesitated to comment until this was provided.

Edit#6: 20150104 @ 20:00PM - The deadline has come and I will submit the questions below to her along with more questions of my own. I'll post her responses as soon as she sends them back to me. Thank you all for your input :) I'll be sure to add your names with your questions.

Here are some of mine:

I was absolutely sure that GOT7 would be bigger by now and challenging EXO as the most popular new generation Big 3 boy group.

I thought Sistar and EXID would be one hit wonders.

I thought Girl's Day would be stuck in nugu-dom forever.

When I first watched Invincible Youth I thought Hyuna was annoying, but now I really like her.

I thought Nayeon would be the most popular member of TWICE overall, and Sana would be the most popular foreign member. But of course this still has some time for it be proven right or wrong.

EDIT: I thought of another way to word the question. Have your opinions about certain groups or idols changed?",169,76

Yuri: 'My mum? She has a very bright personality, extremely optimistic and foremost very strong. I've never seen her crying before. One day I was about to go out but she didn't see me off like she usually does, the dogs didn't show up at the foyer as well. I didn't pay much attention to that initially, I just yelled I'm going out again. Then I found the dogs near the balcony trying to get out, then I curiously check to see what's over there. That's when I heard someone sobbing, it was my mum crying. I thought: 'why is mum crying?!' It shocked me when I approached her seeing she was really crying, that wasn't the mum I've always been familiar with. I didn't understand why she had to hide on the tiny balcony to cry (Yuri began sobbing) so I asked her why. 

It was only then I found out my mum has been ill since I was grade 8-9, she even underwent operations, yet she never mentioned...It was because I've been going to lessons since grade 5, I returned home very late at night and I was always saying I had things I wanted to do. Maybe, maybe from mum's perspective, she thinks I'm having a tough life and thus she doesn't want to become a burden to her daughter. Even when getting a sickness like this, she still didn't tell her family about any of of. She secretly underwent operations and got better without informing us from the start. 

A long time after that, the day when I found mum crying right outside the balcony, it was when her illness returned again. I only realised she had cancer because it came back to haunt her again. Only then I started putting bits and pieces together, like a solving a puzzle, looking at incidences one by one. There was one time when she didn't pick me up when I was in secondary school. She went to the hospital to pick up her diagnosis report, she was told she only got a few months left. Even so, she hid it from me, and she was very, very optimistic and happy even at times like that, even constantly reminding me to eat on time and eat well. She never shows any signs for me to raise suspicions on her health. 

I understand her much much better now and I'll treat her even better from now on. I will become a strong woman like her.'

MC: Is she better now? 
Yuri: Yes, thankfully, she's all healthy now.",24,165

1655,2015-12-30,2015,12,30,8,3ypt0j,I honestly appreciate r/kpop so much more now...,huangt,1451432866,"Hello! This is my first post in quite a while and I think people here are not as personal with each other as people are on the site on which I have incurred quite a few grievances on that I will mention soon so you may not really know who I am. Anyway, I digress. I just came back on r/kpop tonight and am really, really astonished by the positivity. It may not seem like much to you guys, but this community is REALLY nice. I was on **OneHallyu** from around f(x) comeback and drifted there until about now. At first I really, really enjoyed it because i stayed on the f(x) official thread most of the time. Everyone on that thread is extremely passionate about f(x). During the actual 4 Walls comeback, there were so many posts and I didn't ever feel the need to really drift away from it. However as promotions ended, the thread slowed down (rn its basically like 20ish posts a day which is slow). 



I got bored and just went to the home one day. This is the section in which every thread is posted. It is a cesspool of hate, immaturity and annoying perverted users. Ive realized that the people there seriously can't take ANY criticism about the groups they like or they blow up. Yet most people there don't like some groups and say the same bad things about other groups. Also there are so many trolls everywhere and many target Yeri and other underage female idols and make terrible, terrible jokes like ""When can I take her away"" and ""when will she turn legal"" and stuff. There is SO much fighting between TWICE (a girl group which I really kinda have a negative view of because of the absolutely immature fans on OH), GFriend and Red Velvet stans. The bashing thread is probably one of the most active threads and it makes me want to lose hope for humanity because not only are the things said there extremely spiteful but also almost all the posts gather tons of up votes. 



And this is just the beginning of it.
The final straw for me there was when a user made a thread about SNSD and their success and some person was like ""red velvet will top SNSD's peak"" and then someone else replied saying ""no they'll only reach fx level popularity"" and then another person was like ""don't even try to compare red velvet or snsd to fx. they are a trash girl group and only fx delulus think anything like that"". This extremely vitriolic comment got like 10 likes (that is a lot for OH because it's more like a forum not like a reddit format thing). Yeah I was pretty upset. But yeah thats all. 


you can check the site out here: onehallyu.com (no they don't have that adult website redirect anymore)
here are some threads lol 
**THIS is the thread I'm talking about:** http://onehallyu.com/topic/264330-people-need-to-stop-putting-snsd-as-the-point-of-success-for-girl-groups/
another stupid immature thread: http://onehallyu.com/topic/264691-gfriend-vs-twice-this-should-prove-whos-better/

**bashing thread:**http://onehallyu.com/topic/201387-the-official-bashing-thread/


tl;dr OneHallyu is a cesspool of immaturity, hate and trolls. r/kpop is a better KPOP community that doesnt make me lose faith in humanity. 

EDIT: I just wanna say that I think the group official threads aren't that bad (i only know f(x)'s and the people there, like I've said before, are really nice). also formatting",210,118

Anyway, what are your thoughts for KBS Gayo as of now? Personally, I think KBS Gayo is much better than SBS Gayo after watching part 1 of KBSs because first of all I like the line-up here better with much more collaboration between the idols. Zion T and Jungkook collaboration performance were the best for me for part 1 as well as Tiffany and Wendy's performance. I thought it was an emotional and meaningful performance.

Many thanks to you all earlier in the month for watching my video on my time as a K-pop journalist. I greatly appreciate you all, the subs, and the people's I inspired to want to be a go-getter! 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3vdjwi/this_mans_experience_as_a_kpop_journalist_in/](Thread for reference)

With this in mind, i'm looking at doing ANOTHER 30 day challenge! This time it's an AMA video challenge! For 30 days, I will answer the best questions about my previous time as a K-pop journalist with NO holding back on what I know (I kept certain things secret but i'm like eff it now). I will also answer any questions you have about Korea in general and the Kpop scene here. 

To show my thanks, those that ask the best questions will be in a raffle for a free giveaway. What am I giving away? K-pop socks! If I pick your question, I will ship a pair of socks to you around late February or March (my job is starting camp right now and I MIGHT get surgery on my jaw next month, hence the late arrival).

Here are the socks (though if I find more in Seoul, i'll post here):

Link 1: [Socks 1](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=325820886)

Link 2: [Socks 2](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=229270610)

Link 3: [Socks 3](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=350157082)

Many thanks again to you all! Hope to hear your questions!

Edit: I've decided to make this a New Years Special. I had to go to the dentist today and get one of my wisdom teeth removed. I'll have to get the other side done next week. Instead of going through IMMENSE PAIN in trying to do this in 30 days, i'm just going to do it in one. Whoever's question I answer will still be able to get the socks as promised. My mouth is in SO MUCH PAIN right now, it isn't even funny. On the plus side, once I get this done, my mouth will look MUCH better after February! Thanks again!

Edit 2: Here's the video!
