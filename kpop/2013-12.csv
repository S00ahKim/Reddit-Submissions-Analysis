2,2013-12-1,2013,12,1,10,1rt5tv,[Event] Miss KPop Ohio 2014,Garbanian,1385862504,"Hey everyone, I can't say I'm the biggest Kpop fan, but I do like me some korean music for sure.
That being said, I'm going to be hosting an event in Quarter 1 of 2014 for Miss KPop Ohio 2014. This is going to be a drag event for drag queens. It's going to be a pretty fun thing.

I do require a bit of help from anyone in the northern Ohio (Akron area) for this event.
I need 2-3 judges to assist in judging performances based on a few criteria.
1. Lip Sync (These performers will ALL be lipsyncing mixes of kpop, or normal kpop songs)
2. KPop Fashion (I'm far from good with Kpop fashion)
3. Choreography. Part of the contest will require groups (3+ at this point) to perform a Kpop routine from a video/live act.

Due to this being hosted in a bar/club setting, all judges will be required to be at least 21 years of age.
If anyone has questions about this, or would like more information or would like to be a potential judge please shoot me a message.",8,6

63,2013-12-3,2013,12,3,4,1rxj5e,[News] SMENT clears up confusion; EXO's title track is going to be sung by only 3 members,E-X-O,1386012710,"It appears people have been confused about whether EXO would be making a comeback as a whole group or as a sub-unit.  This may be due to the fact that only three members will be performing on this week's music shows and that even the MV teaser featured one scene with just three members looking like something of a small band.
 
SM Entertainment addressed people's confusion on December 2.  The agency said, ""It appears people are saying that EXO will be promoting as a sub-unit with three members, but **they are not an official unit; rather, they are part of a special stage**.""
 
The rep continued, ""It is true that **Baekhyun, D.O, and Chen sang the title song for this album**, 'Miracles in December.'  We also plan on dressing the three of them up for this week's music shows . . . However, this does not mean they are officially promoting as a sub-unit.  **We are planning to henceforth have other members also go up on stage for varied performances**.
 
We are preparing diverse performances because this album is a special album that captures the essence of winter and is filled with thanks for the fans.  In addition, we plan to have only three members on stage just for this week and believe it is not correct to call this a sub-unit activity.""

'Thai Perfect' is a pun on SJ-M's last release before Break Down, ''. '' or 'ti wnmi' translates to 'too perfect' (or 'perfection', sometimes). Go puns!

**SS5:**

**Notable performances include...**

* [KRY's rendition of Gray Paper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUi3rCnGAw), Yesung's last OST before enlisting. Yesung sang this as a solo at the SS5 dates that he participated in. Kyuhyun and Ryeowook sing parts, with a recording of Yesung appearing on the screens and joining them.

* [The crossdressing stage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep0FFnPlch8), because no SuperShow is complete without one. Parodying female soloists, it features [Sungmin as Hyuna](http://24.media.tumblr.com/4f0a9e6c458da298a7ce9906bb9848ae/tumblr_mkkviyhCno1re2v87o1_1280.jpg), [Ryeowook as Bada](http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/781796809.jpg?1371362245), [Kangin as Gain](http://d1i45kki000yqu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kangin-inside.jpg), and [Siwon as...someone-I-can't-remember](http://desmond.yfrog.com/Himg814/scaled.php?tn=0&amp;server=814&amp;filename=i9zfe.jpg&amp;xsize=480&amp;ysize=480). For SS5 Macau a couple of days ago, [Heechul took over as Gain](http://i.imgur.com/QUmNQWS.gif) [~~with a bonus featuring Gunhee~~](http://i.imgur.com/acYvgrA.png).

* SS5 Macau experienced some technical difficulties with audio cutting out entirely. KRSZ (Kyuhyun-Ryeowook-Sungmin-Zhoumi, the substitute ballad-unit) continued harmonizing and finished their [How Am I Supposed To Live Without You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tLeNwG7zwk) completely a capella out of the blue. Donghae took the opportunity during a talk portion to tell the fans that they were so hot the wires burnt out...&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;.

**Speaking at Oxford University:**

Super Junior was invited to speak at Oxford University. Kyuhyun, Eunhyuk, Kangin, and Siwon went to speak about their music, their individual activities, and Hallyu in general. They did have translators there, but [the boys introduced themselves in English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kswOtwf8DY). They also played [rock-paper-scissors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhJx1b3bDk) a few times to decide speaking order. There are a lot of fancams up of the different speeches on YT, I haven't linked more than the opening.

**8th anniversary:**

Super Junior celebrated its 8th anniversary by going to Hawaii, both for a vacation and to shoot for the Memory in Hawaii photobook(s), also known as the time that Donghae and Eunhyuk hacked into SM's official Youtube channel to give us stuff like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsrgJHmRoTY), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdG1PetXABM), and [this, the hula dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB24M5MvrOE). The MIH is basically a whole project of SJ going around Hawaii, having fun, trying to pull planes around, learning how to surf, and so on.

**CFs:**

* **Super Junior**: Kyochon Chicken (previously with Ailee; I can't remember if she's still on them); Lotte Duty Free, SPAO (with f(x))

* **SJ-M**: Tony Moly

* **Kyuhyun, Siwon**: SK Telecom LTE Nut (with Yoona, Seohyun)

^(~~I just remembered a few of these off the top of my head, this certainly isn't an exhaustive list.~~)

And for the flipside, has an artist ever released a song that's made you either begin to dislike them or simply made you think...less of them, I guess would be a way to describe it.

Can range from plain indifference to to loving them, all the way to simply losing respect for them somehow.

Just a few off the top of my head for me:
 
* **Girl's Day** - [Oh! My God](http://youtu.be/O-Ep0N5Eyeg)

Probably the biggest one for me on this list. It started when I was kinda browsing around YouTube and saw this video from a group I hadn't even heard of previously and I decided to check them out. A few days later I had most of their songs on my iPod and was helplessly obsessed with Sojin (soon devolved into me simply liking all of the members, with a slight bias towards Hyeri after watching Kira Kira Slim. I miss Jihae...). While they weren't all that popular before, I'm so glad that Expectation and Female President has caused Dai5ys to increase exponentially (also, I'm happy they all have their own dedicated subreddits).

* **APink** - [Nonono](http://youtu.be/n3XJQtJWKJM)

To put it simply, I never really looked into APink before since, according to my friend, they were just a ""shameless ripoff"" of SNSD (since apparently one of their MVs copied concepts from SNSD MVs or something like that, as if groups hadn't had similar concepts before). Now, though, I'm absolutely in love with them, especially at the moment after I recently when through their APink Diary videos (I wish Bomi would get more solo stuff...at least she's been getting some features!)

* **Nine Muses** - [Ticket](http://youtu.be/_aOq_1T8XY0)

Similar case to before, this was another *alleged* shameless SNSD-ripoff group, and really, I have no idea what that friend of mine was talking about. Nine Muses really has their own distinct sound that I can't help but like (probably because all the members of the group sing simultaneously a lot, or something like that, can't really figure it out). Ticket was like a gateway drug of some sort, and though I don't really like them as much as other groups on this list, I still keep an eye on them. 

And just to make the list a bit more diverse,

* **Infinite** - [Be Mine](http://youtu.be/DeuejYoRbps), [Before The Dawn](http://youtu.be/F8s8v9Mj8XM), and [Paradise](http://youtu.be/Sj0FvZGSzCo).

Simply put, I wasn't really all that into many guy groups around before (I was into 2PM and Shinee, yeah, but they were pretty much the mainstream back then. Now Shinee at least alternates with EXO, kinda, and 2PM comes back once a year, sometimes not even, and then explodes into oblivion until the next time). After I learned a friend of mine was into K-Pop, I asked her to recommend some songs and these three were among those she told me about, being a huge Inspirit and all. And, while I haven't really found too many exceptional songs by them since, I kinda adore Infinite, in a way. They have just enough members for me to be able to match names and faces easily (unlike SuJu or EXO), and they're not *too* pretty boy-ish, in my opinion (like, say, Boyfriend). From what I recall, Wooyoung from 2PM said in an interview that he hopes he can one day manage a group similar to Infinite (it was back during his Solo Debut era, I can try to look it up if you guys want).  


Anyways, that's enough rambling from me. There hasn't really been anything that's made me *dislike* a group too much, but I'm sure there's cases where it's happened, or maybe I'm just not in the right state of mind or it to come up...


What about you guys? Have there been any songs that have swayed your opinion of a group in one way or another?",46,27

For me the intro of IU's [Good Day MV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeqdYqsrsA0) has that really light fluffy feeling that I love about the Christmas season.

So tell me what K-Pop songs really get you into the holiday spirit?

**A Pink**- They have had a really great year with No No No being a huge hit. With Eunji's roles in dramas and Naeun on We Got Married they've amassed a lot of public recognition. 




**Girls Day**- Things didn't look to well for them this time last year but they made the comeback of a lifetime with ""Expectation"" earlier this year. All 4 girls have been pursuing solo activities to build public interest and it seems to be working as they are one of the most talked about groups this year.




**History**- This one is kind of a wild card for me. They only debuted this year but LOEN seems to be heavily pushing them to be the next big thing with 3 comebacks this year. I feel like they've also found their niche sound with their latest release ""What Am I To You"". 




**VIXX**- This one for me seems almost inevitable. VIXX has been on a roll as of late with multiple comebacks this year each bigger than the last. Their unique dark concepts keep people guessing and I can't wait to see what they do next.

Ok well I'm not sure exactly how true this is I'm just trying to piece together a few theory's of mine so lets not jump the gun. So it goes like this I was on omegle a week maybe two back and I came a across a girl asking me which company I liked better sm,yg or jyp. I told her sm n she then started telling me that she was a trainee for a new group named interG. Of course I'm freakin out n asked why she's on omegle n she said because her manager asked her to survey. she had to go after that she never told me her name but here's my theory. perhaps it was seulgi one of the sm rookies maybe she will debut In the so called group interG, I guess we will just have to wait n see theirs still the chance it was just some random girl and I'm just over thinking. idk what do u guys think?

The song does not have to have been a hit nor do you have to like it; It simply has to scream 2013 to you.

For girl groups I'd say that it was [T-ara N4 - Jeon Won Diary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74_3c_5SVBM)
I nominate this song because it is an IGAB style bi-polar song by a hip-hop styled sub-unit. And all of these were big trends in 2013.

For guys I'd say it was [VIXX - On and On.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TcXHDJIShI)
I say this primary because it is a dark and gothic song which was a popular choice for a concept this ear among guys.

Are there any K-Pop songs based around this concept, or that even mention it in passing (i.e. those lines like ""even if I'm born again, I'll find you"" or whatever)? I thought really hard but could only recall J-Pop songs. I'm so sure there are K-Pop ones though. Please help?",3,6

I also feel there are a few of us that have been listening to Kpop for over 10 years. So just out of curiosity how long have you've listened to Kpop?

Personally I started to listen to Kpop in the late 90's and was introduced to it by my buds. At the same times I was also listening to a lot of Jpop as well. Ever since then I've been on and off on Kpop and started to listen to them again because of my friends now. So how about what's your story?  ",68,15

447,2013-12-14,2013,12,14,10,1su8rb,[MV] EXO -Growl with [Audio] EXO - The Star,[deleted],1386986376,"I noticed that The Star and Growl share the same tempo so I tried playing the one shot [MV for Growl with the Audio for The Star](http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/52abb7c8ba882-exo-the-star-audio-with-growl-mv.php).  I think the timing is mostly there, particularly when the camera for Growl swings around for verse 2.

If the mashup doesn't load for your browser properly you can just open two windows of YouTube.  Let 'The Star' play until about 12.5 sec, then start 'Growl' MV from 0 sec.

If anyone is clever enough to actually bounce these two videos and repost, that would be great, spread the holiday EXO.

In my opinion, I believe that while indeed, K-pop does have some good things going for it, I believe the bad things are simply way too plentiful and large to simply sweep under the rug. I often think about behind the scenes, how our favorite groups are probably very much fractured alliances. I also worry about the mental health of the idols, as Ahreum as shown us.

508,2013-12-16,2013,12,16,19,1t00jg,KPOPPY.com 2.0 is coming (with your help)!,alleybetwixt,1387191276,"Hey guys! I'm planning to roll out the new site for the new year.

KPOPPY.com is nearing its first year of being a thing. I know many of you continue to use it, recommend it for newbies, and send me suggestions of artists to add, which is totally awesome. That's what it's for! I'm thrilled to see it being a helpful resource.

[Like I said in the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1bsobc/kpoppy_a_site_i_designed_for_kpop_newbies/), the site was made for fun and was pretty clunky. Especially the navigation. Ive spent a couple months streamlining the structure. What was eleven pages is now three (plus a sitemap). 

**WARNING: There is a strong chance you will crash it. Im poor, so it doesnt have robust bandwidth. Lol. You crashed it last time, so youll probably do it again. Please dont let that deter you from visiting the site in the next day or two (or week) and e-mail or comment/message me here with your feedback.**

Here we go... **KPOPPY 2.0**: (1) [INFO](http://kpoppy.com/info.html) (2) [MUSIC](http://kpoppy.com/music.html) (3) [MEDIA](http://kpoppy.com/media.html)

(The [original KPOPPY is still up](http://kpoppy.com/), but there is no link from it to 2.0 right now.)

Once again, Im calling on you to be my guinea pigs. The main purpose of KPOPPY is to serve you guys. Ideally, you can help me fine-tune the site to your needs. On to business!

* Better or worse? Your overall impression of the new structure.
* Does the top navigation work for you? It should be fixed at the top and highlight each section as you click the navbar or scroll. (Bonus points if you can tell me how it looks/works on a tablet or smartphone. I have neither.)
* The page navigation (INFO, MUSIC, MEDIA circles) is in a strange spot. Is it okay or is it too difficult to figure out?
* Does everything appear to be loading (quickly): graphics, webfonts (in the navbar/header if you can tell), content?

General content questions:

* Anything glaringly missing? Possible sections I havent thought of?
* All groups/songs/MVs and group descriptor buzzwords are open to change or debate. (For example, how do you feel about replacing Wonder Girls (now on hiatus) with 4minute in the Top 20?)
* I need your help filling out the MEDIA page more. Any links to where you watch variety shows or vloggers, listen to radio, participate in fan communities, read blogs, etc hit me with em!
* Im not a skilled writer. If youd like to write some blurb or paragraph for the INFO page, or anything else, go for it! Ill credit you with a nickname/handle/link or whatever if you wish. Id love to get more of you contributing. PM or e-mail me.

No need to respond to everything (unless you want to), just whatever is relevant to you. Ill be replying to all feedback. Whatever suggestions Im able to implement will go up over the next few weeks, then Ill update the links on 2.0 so that the KPOPPY homepage will take you right to the new INFO page that will be in the first week of 2014.

Enjoy the Holidays, good luck on midterms/finals, and a preemptive Happy New Year!

The concert rep stated, ""This party will stray from the format of other concerts going on during Christmas and the end of the year and will enable fans to freely listen to and enjoy music... The concept of this party is a combination of a concert and festival and will exude a fun club-like atmosphere.""



Only those 19 years of age and older will be able to attend this exclusive Christmas party so if you're in the area on Christmas Eve, this party just might be one you won't want to miss! so grab tickets on Interpark's website!

(More information inside)",bestfriendkpop,1387402803,"First let me say that I totally do not know anything about Kpop. Hes tried to show me before and I just... its not my thing. I think its great and everything, Im just not a pop music kind of person, you know?  
  
Second, I know that you cant really tell if someones gay from the music they listen to, but this is bigger than when *I* listen to music. This is like a real honest-to-god obsession with these kpop guys, and I just want to know him better and- yes, okay, Im kind of in love with him and Im just asking the question before I tell him that (or dont, because hes gay and Ive thrown myself in front of a bus or whatever).  
  
So Ive tried to learn the bands he likes, and I know he likes a group called Shiny (a lot, like a lot a lot), Newest (also a lot a lot), and another called Infinite. There are some abbreviations ones, I think? B.T.S. (He all of a sudden became obsessed with them like a few months ago), EXO (he has an EXO poster in his room actually so Im sure I spelled that one right), and B.A.P. (which he said was super awesome, then suddenly sucked, then was awesome again).  

I dont know if the groups matter exactly but I think hes into a style of kpop music - I mean at least he talks about it like therere a bunch of different types of fans anyhow - so I put it in incase its important because:  
  
The thing is, he has like a tumblr and its just this continuous stream of super attractive kpop guys, and sometimes theyre like shirtless and sometimes theyre kissing each other? Or pretending to kiss or whatever? And he goes *nuts* over that. I mean I get shipping or whatever, although Ive never known another GUY shipper, but these guys actually seem to be all over each other. So maybe there are gay groups? Or something? There was definitely a gay video that he showed me, where it was clear at the end that the guy was freaked out about his friend getting married, I remember that one VERY clearly, about a year ago, maybe? So maybe that group is gay and I just get them all confused?  
  
When I say hes obsessed, I mean he can get onto youtube, and start watching these videos (he has like 250 youtube subscriptions), and like 10 hours later hell still be there, just as completely edge-of-his-seat focused as he was when he started. He practices the dances (we go to a performing arts HS and hes studying dance - also kind of unusual for guys), he gets stuff shipped from korea, hes even learning Korean. He even has like an kpopy hairdo (he's white). It's sexy (he's super sexy) but it's also kind of.. I don't know.    
  
He spends ALL of his money on kpop albums and posters and tickets and anything he can find. (Which makes Christmas super easy but.)    
  
I mean, its not like he misses school. Hell (seriously) forget to eat if you leave him alone with youtube all day, but other than that its not like hes in danger or anything. But its way, WAY beyond anything Ive seen over music before (and we go to a music school!) and its all about these guys and I just... want to know if it means anything. Before I talk to him. And because I want to understand him better.  
  
And its pretty clear that the whole thing really embarrasses him. Like he just shrugs and says foreign music if someone ever asks what kind of music he likes, and if someone asks him about a dance hes doing from one of these videos he just shrugs and says its something he saw online and when he went to some concert in LA this past summer he just told everyone he was going to LA, not to a concert. He doesnt like to talk about it, which is part of why Im asking you.  
  
So can you help me understand him better? (I can get more details if you need them.)  
  
Oh, he's not into Reddit so I'm not worried about this post. He's more of a tumblr/facebook/instagram guy.   

TLDR: my best friend is obsessed with pretty male kpop stars who hug and hang all over each other. Is he gay or just crazy or is this how kpop is or what?",35,0

For those of you who have been curious of the singer the character Yoon Jin from Reply 1994 is obsessed with, yes, it is Seo Taiji. 

He was already a huge hit when he debuted with his first album in 1992, and, even by a guy like me who was born in 1994 and lived most of Seo Taiji's career as a little baby, he is remembered as a substantial influence over the young generation and kpop in general. 

I wanted to share this song that came out in 2009, the year I left Korea for the U.S.. This song and the entire album really have helped me deal with nostalgia to this date.

On a side note, I could not find any legitimate translation of the lyrics, so I decided to do it myself. I will have to explain that some of the translation is not direct translation, because I was trying to keep the original sensation the lyrics gives to the listener. If I chose to translate it from word to word, the lyrics would be a hot mess of unintelligible phrases. 


&gt; Additional Info: 

1. Seo Taiji rules

2. The lyrics of this song is heavily related to losing virginity and the first sex. I won't explain why and how. It's for you to find out.

3. To give you a little hint, in Korean language, the words 'Island' and 'Sex' are pronounced very similarly. So you can substitute sex for island. 

4. For Korean learners out there, DO NOT WORRY if you cannot understand a single word he says. Even I can't understand them without reading the lyrics. He is infamous for his bad pronunciation, whether it is intended or not. 

5. He started his career as a hip-hop musician and then changed to rock genre. I agree that it is a weird transition, but many people consider him as both 'father of Korean hip-hop' and 'a great influence over Korean modern rock.'

6. He married the girl in the MV

Every time I listen to Kpop or watch a MV or any sort of video relating to Kpop, he constantly annoys me and says things like ""Why do you listen to music in a language you don't understand?"" or ""What the fuck are you watching?!"" (I was watching part of a Crayon Pop documentary with English subs). 

I feel like I constantly have to justify myself when doing anything relating to Kpop when really it shouldn't bother him. Anyone else live or lived with anyone like this? Not too sure what I can do in this situation, I'm sick of telling him that I can watch or listen to whatever I want as its my business but he still does it.",83,15

As an American high school student, I know of only five other K-Pop fans in my school and all of them are also A+, which makes me feel as if actual publicity isn't the issue. So what is?",6,0

Girls' Generation will be collaborating with hit rookies EXO in an energetic performance at the '2013 SBS Gayo Daejun' for what promises to be a memorable event between the nation's girl group and one of the most exciting up-and-comers of the year!

Following the SBS performance, Girls' Generation's Tiffany will perform a duet with SHINee's Key at the '2013 MBC Gayo Daejaejun' in a performance that is sure to bring out some of the best vocals in SMTOWN.

This is sort of a question. I'm listening to kpop since 2009, i'd say that my fave groups are snsd but mostly f(x) , but as you may know they are not really active atm.
What could be the reason of them releasing less stuff and having no solo concerts? What is SM afraid of? Do you think they are about to disband?

I am going to be traveling around in Korea for about a month very soon and was peering/searching around various subreddits and sources about ideas of what to do. I've noticed there are accounts and experiences of much of the Korean cultural influence that you can see around (like temples, cultural centers, stuff like that), with only a couple things here and there specifically for Kpop. 

To what I've found out and around are the very general things that are easily searchable, such as: Kpop shops in Myeongdong, Everysing and very basic things on how to get to concerts or where to possibly go for music shows. Maybe that is all there is to Kpop in Korea, but I'm curious to see if there is more. I do understand that Kpop is a small part of Korea, and that there may not be much to do but it'd be nice to have something of reference to when making travel plans in a specific area and there may be some small surprising things to do.

With this in mind, I'd like to try to compile a bunch of information from the experiences of myself after I've done my travels alongside the information/experiences from everyone else into a possibly stickied information thread. I'm hoping the thread will have a large variety of information as detailed as possible for various groups of interest (SONEs, VIPs, etc.). Basically, a mega thread for anyone visiting Korea that is interested in Kpop.

What I'd like to request from everyone is that you write (from knowledge or your own experiences in Korea) what specifically stood out for you about Korea when you were looking for Kpop-centric attractions (ie. music shows, shops, things to do, fansigns for specific idol groups, your stories of what you did to get into shows/concerts/etc.). Documented things are nice (like blogs) and anything for a wide variety of Kpop groups in general. Having more is better than having less, so details are welcome. I'll try to make specific sections for various fandoms so even if your experiences are specifically for one group, it will help. Another thing that you can bring up is where to get notified of concerts/get the tickets (I have http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_concert.htm for example for the concert dates, and the yes24 site for tickets in general), and maybe how you booked your things/found your way around.

Please feel free to message me with your experiences/information, or leave them below in the comments and within a month and a bit I'll try to get said guide/thread out.

Thank you all for your time in reading/contributing!",20,22

I look at SM and you can slowly see groups like SHINee fall out and f(x) is treated pretty badly as well. Is it true that SM only really care about EXO and maybe Girls Generation? Yes, I have no idea how they actually treat their artists but from an outside perspective I don't see any of the older groups getting more popular any time soon. As much as it kills me to say it, I even think f(x) might be  in for a rough 2014.
