I know many of you have been waiting for a new version of the census to come out. Sorry for the long delay - here it is in all of its glory:

**[Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&amp;formkey=dGJ0VmN2Y3MzZkwwRXlBZmtNS1N0QWc6MQ#gid=0)**

Please let me know ASAP if you notice any issues with the survey. I've edited it based on feedback from last year - including allowing the selection of multiple favorite artists, changing the 'region' question, and adding more year ranges for the question 'How long have you been listening to K-pop'. 

Results will be published after the census has been up for a few weeks. Thanks for being patient! :)

&lt;3,

JessiTee",146,125

My youtube channel is based on weekly tops of the newest kpop songs (ocasionally I might also do some Kpop video reactions, videos random old underrated songs I like, or whatever you suggest) and was inspired on several other youtubers (such as DJ Digital, MyKpopChart1, Santish XY, KPop Andy and Titibooh.) I just loved and respected their work and wanted to do the same.

136,2014-2-6,2014,2,6,7,1x4f6g,Your girl group ranking 2014,[deleted],1391638387,"Inspired by the girl group ranking that just came out, I wanted to create my own ranking. That ranking was based on popularity, but this ranking should be based on how much you like each group's music. I feel like there are always discussions about people's favorite group, but I'd be curious as to how people rank everyone else below their bias.

My ranking:

S

Brown Eyed Girls - So so talented and they own their maturity

Nine Muses - I've consistently liked all their recent work

A

Girl's Day - Really liked their comebacks last year but Something is not as good

SISTAR - I was a big fan of Give it to me and their recent stuff

SPICA - Please don't kill me but I liked their older work better than Tonight and You     
    don't love me, so talented I wish they'd get recognized

SECRET - Love Jieun's voice, I like Poison and I do I do, Talk that's not bad

T-ara - Love their old work (first album), make really catchy songs even though 
    they're not that good at singing, I kind of like them more now than before their 
    scandal because they're bad bitches and they keep coming back to spite the 
    haters

(Wonder Girls - pretty solid)

B

f(x) - Pink Tape was a pretty solid album but I don't like many of their title tracks

SNSD - Recent releases have been meh but overall they have some good stuff

2NE1 - Pretty hit or miss group for me, last year was meh

miss A - I really want to like them but they always let me down, peaked with debut
    Hush was OK

(KARA - pretty hit or miss for me)

APink - I don't like all their stuff but I really like a bunch of their side tracks

C

After School - All their songs are kind of bland to me, I feel like they have no good
    singers, but Shh was one of my favorite songs of 2013 + like what someone else
    said I feel like they're always in a talent show with their tap shoes and pole 
    dancing etc.

Ladies Code - liked their debut album but didn't like their following comebacks
    I feel like they still need to find their style but I think they have a lot of potential

Rainbow - Liked their 2 comebacks in 2013 but I don't have strong feelings about
     them 

Hello Venus

AOA - didn't like their recent comebacks

D

4minute - Have never really liked any of their stuff

Dal Shabet - I can't get into them

Crayon Pop - Can't take them seriously

150,2014-2-6,2014,2,6,15,1x5qd1,Crayon Pop reported to make a comeback in April without their helmets,Crayon_Pope,1391666659,"&gt; The girls that took over the K-Pop scene with ""Bar Bar Bar"", Crayon Pop, are reported to be getting ready to start another dance craze with their comeback this April!
&gt; 
&gt; A rep from Chrome Entertainment is said to have told Star News for their exclusive report, ""Crayon Pop are going full speed ahead in their album production with the goal of early April... **They are preparing their first full-length album**... Although there can be slight changes to the release date due to their various domestic schedules, they will make a comeback in April.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""They are receiving songs from Kim Yoo Min, the composer of 'Bar Bar Bar', and other composers... Since it's a full-length album, we are paying more attention to the song selection and thoroughly preparing for it.""
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the concept this time around and whether the girls will be sporting their famous helmets, the rep apparently stated, ""Although nothing has been decided yet, we will take on a different concept... Because we showed a lot of the helmet concept, the probability of using [the helmets] is little to none.""
&gt; 
&gt; Another rep spoke with 'Sports Seoul' to confirm that an April comeback is indeed in the works, ""We haven't decided on the specific date and concept, but an album is planned to be released around April... We're still in talks about a new concept, and we're also not yet sure of how many songs will be included in the album."" 

Emphasis mine.

I feel like most of the thought-provoking stuff I've read are on random forum threads or blog posts but unfortunately, the ideas that are presented don't really get fleshed out.

Can you guys post some articles that you found insightful? I've been super into K-Pop the past few years but unlike most other music I listen to, there isn't much discussion surrounding it or analysis of the music + videos within a larger context.

All articles that touch on K-Pop in anyway are good so post as much as possible, I'd really appreciate it! And thanks in advance!",11,35

I'm a long time lurker and K-pop fan, and I've been teaching Korean through [my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/gobillykorean) for over a year. I'm a bit different in that I'm a non-Korean who's learned to speak fluent Korean (white guy speaking Korean here).

Today I launched my Kickstarter project to create a new book for learning the Korean language. Specifically, it's targeted to people who've never learned any Korean before (it even teaches Hangul completely, including sound change rules), but it also has detailed tips for people who want to learn more about what they already know. You can check it out here: **[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-a-beginners-guide-to-korean](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gobillykorean/korean-made-simple-a-beginners-guide-to-korean)**

Being able to speak Korean means I don't need subtitles for songs. Often times, things are lost in translation, including hidden meanings or nuances in words, and the only people who can understand them are those who know Korean. If you're not studying Korean already, I'd highly recommend starting.

I'm also happy to answer questions about anything, including Korean questions. I'd love if more people became interested in this awesome language.",117,265

Rep: Hello?

Anchorwoman Kim Hyun Jung: You are currently running an agency, right? Does that mean you also manage idols?

Rep: I am not currently a manager but I am indeed working with idols. I have 17 years of experience in this field.

KHJ: Have you recently seen the music video of the girl group in question?

Rep: I have indeed.

KHJ: What are your thoughts on that?

Rep: I think that you have shown every inch of skin realistically possible. The industry is a war field at the moment and I feel that they went as far as they could to stand out in such a battle-like environment.

KHJ: You called the industry a field of war, right? Exactly what do you mean by that?

Rep: In one month, there are hundreds of rookie girl and boy groups that debut. Especially with the market now being all about digital singles, there are hundreds of teams promoting at the same time. Groups need something special to stand out in such an environment, and that leads to desperation for some.

KHJ: Among managers, do you all ever discuss about some groups taking it too far?

Rep: Of course. But we all realize it as the result of a harsh reality and the desperation to get the name of their artists known.

KHJ: So do you feel that sexy concepts definitely bring a quick response?

Rep: It's easy to obtain media attention/publicity.

KHJ: Would you consider noise marketing as a form of marketing?

Rep: Of course. It's easy to be picked up by the media and no matter what people say, good or bad, they're still talking about it and taking a look to see ""just how bad it is"".

KHJ: Then do you receive more broadcast invitations as a result of the noise marketing and media attention?

Rep: We do. It's easier for PR and broadcast companies will actually be the ones to search us up and invite us since our name is now known and out there.

KHJ: You do realize that once a sexy concept is caught by the media, there are a lot of hateful comments under that. As a member of the industry, do you consider that success?

Rep: There are some that do, but these idols are still young children themselves so they do end up getting hurt by the comments.

KHJ: But realistically, do these idols have any power to outright say, ""I don't want to do this. I don't want to wear these fishnet stockings""?

Rep: Idols are a member of a team. The team must survive in order for themselves as an individual to survive. It's hard to have an opposing opinion in such a situation as that.

KHJ: I can understand that, especially since idols go through 2-3, even 5 years of training. One missed opportunity could change the fate of their group.

Rep: That's right. It's difficult for a team to pull through with a concept if one member isn't on board.

KHJ: How much money is required to raise one such idol group?

Rep: A lot. Astronomical, actually. From dorms to outfits, choreography, singing, concept planning... it's truly astronomical.

KHJ: Could you ballpark a number?

Rep: At the minimum, 200k~300k USD to 500k~700k at the most.

KHJ: This is just for a debut?

Rep: Yes. There's a lot of planning involved and that period alone has a lot of expenses.

KHJ: So even if they manage to come up with the expenses and actually debut, only one out of hundreds actually make it, which is why groups constantly go for sexier concepts with more skin showing.

Rep: It's all for survival. You need to catch the eye of the public. The mindset is, ""Since that team is wearing fishnet stockings, we must wear fishnet stockings AND rip them. The next team is going to wear lingerie, then,"" and so on and so forth. None of us know, however, how far any of us will go in the end...

KHJ: As a CEO yourself, how do you feel about such a reality?

Rep: I'm a father of two daughters myself so I'm concerned about the commercialization of women and how they'll grow up to perceive these concepts. I'm also concerned about young children copying such concepts...

KHJ: Then as an industry expert, do you feel that such concepts have longevity? Are they for long term success?

Rep: I'm sure everyone's thinking the same thing... and it's that the concept will only last as long as you can continue to come up with a concept more provocative than the last, and there is only so much further you can go.

KHJ: So managers know that it's for the short term but they're desperate for instant attention so they do it anyway?

Rep: Yes, it's all for survival.

KHJ: You have a very negative view of the concept... I'm sure other people in the industry share your view but go with the concept anyway, right?

Rep: Yes. These groups take a lot of money and planning so we're all scared about debuting them and having them end up forgotten or never known. The seduction of the sexy concept is real.

KHJ: Then how much more do groups earn once they get their name known for a sexy concept?

Rep: The only income in the industry right now is from digital sales and performing at events through getting your name known. Once your name's out there, you get that many more invitations, and sometimes that little difference could mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in income.

**Comments**

1. [+459, -14] If we really want to improve our music industry, what we need to do is not leave hateful comments on articles about young female idols but actually purchase the albums of talented artists when they make their comebacks. In the entertainment industry, even hateful comments are seen as a form of interest so the more you leave hateful comments on sexy concepts, the more they're going to think they need to keep up with it for more interest. It's only until they stop making money off of it that they'll turn their interests elsewhere. If you truly want a better music industry, think of other methods to change it...

2. [+187, -1] I suppose it's the same concept as makjang dramas getting better viewer ratings

3. [+44, -6] In the end, it's because the public wants it. I don't want to see it but that's what the public wants so that's what they're providing.

One of the comments informed me that there isn't a lack of producers. This was just an assumption that I made. Thanks for the interesting discussion!** 

The paragraph below isn't worded very well but **please share your opinion on whether or not kpop is saturated with idol groups atm?** (The question is not whether you think there should be fewer idols and more ""artists"", but whether or not the industry can fit more idol groups.)

In kpop people are always like ""there are a hundred new groups debuting every month"" so it's really competitive and hard to get noticed, but then I feel like beyond that point, the number of groups with recognizable names is really small. Like sometimes there are several weeks at a time when I feel like it's just nugus promoting, so there should be room for more idols in the industry.
And a lot of these nugu groups are really talented even if their song/choreo doesn't show it off very well. I think what puts a lot of people off is when these groups can't afford a legit producer so they get stuck with some generic song.

Also the existence of concepts makes genericness an even bigger problem because instead of being creative they intentionally put themselves in boxes that are already overflowing

Another thing is the music show setup makes everyone focused on winning #1, which further reduces the number of groups the industry can ""hold"" because it's not seen as a successful comeback unless you win #1, so when planning a comeback everyone tries to make sure they pick a time when nobody else is really promoting. If management cared less about winning the shows and more about making quality music then theoretically the top 3 or 5 or whatever of the music shows could all be good promotions and get some public recognition 

The industry really isn't that competitive at the higher levels, just look at how all the top groups maintain their positions in the tier lists even if they have one or a few meh comebacks in a row. Scandals or disbanding are more likely to affect the tier lists -_-

**tl;dr There are** lots of talented groups, but too few good producers. It seems like everyone thinks the solution to this is to have fewer groups, but I feel like the number of groups isn't problematic since a lot of them are really talented, so rather the shortage of producers is the bigger problem, but idk how to change that.  

This video makes me realize just how few non-nugu groups there are. Obviously it doesn't include boy groups, but idk why they even made a top 40 video as if there were non-nugu groups that didn't make the cutthe last few are all nugus.

Warning: This is a controversial topic so if you are one of those people who believe that their bias group is perfect with the members it has then please reconsider whether you want to view this thread as this discussion will contain views different from your own.

I feel like we should make this a more objective thread, like in the sense of which members are needed for the group to continue **making money** and also have the ability to **produce music**. So I guess I'm saying you probably can't remove all of the most popular members and you probably can't remove all of the (most) talented members.
If this were more subjective it would essentially be asking ""what's your ideal subunit?"" but I think that's a discussion for another thread.  

Should we add the requirement that they still perform choreographies so you can't just form ballad groups? Not that ballad groups can't be successful, just that ballad groups would be the obvious answer if we don't require them to dance. 

I think organization-wise we should try to focus each comment on one group and then reply to those comments to keep the thread organized.

579,2014-2-22,2014,2,22,12,1ylifz,[Updated w/ Fine] Jaejoong's slanderer gets punished with a fine,picflute,1393041293,"The malicious person who consistently slandered JYJ's Jaejoong on the internet has been punished with a fine.  The Seoul Central District Court revealed on February 21 that they have fined ""A"" with 1.5 million won (~ $1,400 USD) for defamation.  

Judge Yang said, ""Through this offense, the defendant arbitrarily interpreted, reproduced on a large scale, and maliciously distorted rumors that were being talked about on the internet, severely damaging the victim's reputation.  The victim may be a celebrity in whom the public has an interest in, but as the content in the defamation was strongly affiliated with his private sphere, it is appropriate to deem it damaging.""

From August to September of 2012, a lot of slandering content related to Jaejoong's family relations and sexual preferences were uploaded onto the internet forum of one fan club so that the person responsible, A, was ultimately charged with defamation.  

Source: [allkpoop](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/02/jaejoongs-malicious-slanderer-gets-punished-with-a-fine)

During the process of the trial, A had claimed that A had purposely pretended to be an anti-fan to provoke sympathy for Jaejoong",5,19

I really like watching [Younha - Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDm3W5ozED4). 

It's got such wonderful visuals and I freaking love how in the entire video all she does is run forwards, looking back here and there, and at one point being ""pushed"". Even if she looked down and out, she just gets up and keeps running. The whole thing's just really great, and I love the ET reference. The bit when she gets the rocket booster and that whale comes in was the best of the visual wonder that this video pretty much is. 

Edit: There's another MV for [Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJ3m3xTrlc), also as visually appealing. ",6,0

684,2014-2-26,2014,2,26,15,1yyuz2,I have had it with YG. ( Rant post),Dagachi_One,1393394766,"2NE1 merchandize came out before the Crush album. Its all a business, I don't think its about the music. The music is just condiments to make money. At least G Dragon's Coup d'etat merchandizing came out one day after the album. Even that was a shock to me. 
Do you see American artists with merchandizing. Yes, but not at this level. Its like fast food merchants selling toys with a happy meals. 

That is why YG gets richer while the kids get poorer. Millions of these Blackjacks are preteens or teenagers. Of course millions of them will disagree with me. I get why so many redditors are dissing 2NE1. 

Enjoy listening to the album that was recorded 2 years ago. Yes your happy meal was cooked last year. Having said that I am still looking forward to the songs tonight. Prepared for down vote, but you are more than welcomed to agree with me.",8,0

707,2014-2-27,2014,2,27,12,1z20di,GENERAL DISCUSSION: How many kpop (non-south korean area) fans do you know are in your area?,illegalAz14n,1393472584,"I currently reside in Long Island, Ny. So far, through my peers and community, I rarely get the chance to meet a full on kpop fan. Sure there are people who have heard what kpop is and have stereotypically saw I got a boy as their only kpop vide oewitnessed. It saddens me to see that their aren't many kpop fans i've come in contact with. I've even made the general assumption that i'm the only Kpop fan in my school. I only know one other kpop fan, but he just recently enjoyed the music. However, does anybody in the world have any friends or acquaintances that are true kpop fans? I love discussing my love of kpop with as much poeple as i can. However, most people I acquaint myself with are hopping on the EDM bandwagon, so my communication is limited. Yet, I feel like a rare unicorn at my school, and a little hipster-ish if kpop is ever a fad in my school  

Edit 1: For few years, upon loving the SNSD Gee era, i've only been strictly SNSD up until 2011, in leaving my comfort zone, exploring other groups like f(x), Exo, Suju, etc. I've only been ever-expanding my knowledge and music library since.

Edit 2: I just want to thank everyone who shared their experience with kpop. I really enjoyed knowing there are people like me who doesn't have a lot if acquaintances out there to express. Their love of kpop. I like the fact that I got to even comment back to you guys. Anyways, it's 1:43 am and I'm pretty tired rn. Ill see the other comments (if there are any) when I wake. ",119,18
