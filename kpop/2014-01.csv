3,2014-1-1,2014,1,1,10,1u4tcf,"[Review] /r/koppers, did you miss After School's 6th maxi single this year? Check out this quick review and consider taking a listen.",Scandalbaby,1388541408,"This is a little review thing I decided to write to inform anyone who may have missed After Schools maxi single this year. Mind you, in all honesty, I did not pay attention to After School before this mini album. This mini album was the first After School purchase (and listen) I made, and after giving the album many many listens, I decided the entire album was something to awe at. After some judging, I find it to be the best mini album release this year. 

Mind you i'm not doing this for money or press..or anything,really. I wrote this up for you guys and girls because I felt the album was the best and most unique release of the year.

After Schools 6th maxi single:  ended up packing quite a big punch that I dont think anyone (at least, not myself) expected. I have to say that I always buy physical copies when I can; I enjoy collecting CDs, ect, and kpop albums always seem to give a large bang for the buck when it comes to packaging (unique casing style, photobooks, posters, post cards,ect).

However I bought  on a limb. I really enjoyed the song and choreography was mesmerizing. Even as someone who learns choreography, I would never attempt the title track because..pole dancing. Although, it would turn out that this mini album would become much more than just one song. I expect filler songs on all kpop albums. Songs that are kind of ehhhh and just exist to make the tracklisiting longer. 

I got none with .

The second track,  (First love), is the song that was promoted. The song features a very prominent and loud bass rhythm, and the jazzy saxophones encase the song in a rather transient way. The vocal trade off in this song is very even and it allows us to keep a fresh taste in our ears! What seems like a simple beat with a piano quickly escalates to a pulse pounding emotional chorus. Throughout the chorus we can hear a faint guitar melody that helps bring the bass to life and gives the song a bit of a light-rock feeling. Following the chorus, we have our nanana part with heavy jazz instrumentals and vinyl scratching. The vocal trade off in this song is done very well; there isnt too much, but there isnt too little either. Combining all of this with our classy pole dance and youve got a song that truly stood out throughout the entire year.


The third track, Dressing Room, ended up becoming a selling song for me. This song is a digital synthesizer dream wrapped up in lustful vocals and lyrics. There is a lot of effort put into the seductive manner in this song. A slight echo effect and the repetition of the moaning voice/noise is a prominent theme throughout the entire song. It plays together to make a song that *sounds* like lust. The vocal work here is AMAZING as the trade-off is VERY consistent; each member gets 1 line of the lyrics and it is traded to the next person. This keeps the song sounding very fresh. But while youre lost in a digital dream, the chorus hits. And man, that chorus. We hear a consistent bass drum and a light pitterpatter of cymbals/snare going on. All this while the vocals take a unique escalating position. Perhaps it is the lyrics themselves and how the Korean language sounds, but the vocalistic flow and elevation throughout the chorus is just awesome. The chorus starts slow, but builds into a more frantic feeling towards the end until it sounds like an outburst of emotion. Following the second chorus we are treated with an extended instrumental of the chorus with some altercations; and following that we go into a slow build of the chorus lyrics accompanied by more digital dreamy sounds. Finally, the song closes out with some fantastic vocals by Raina at a rate more on par with the end of the chorus. This song is the best on the album by a long shot. On a short note, the English used in this song is actually good; I find it fits and flows very well.


The fourth track, Times Up, adds more digital sound but this time with a spicy bass guitar. We first hear a piano and some English; the song then transitions with a heavy bass drum and into the chorus. During the chorus with hear that spicy bass guitar and bass drum; the piano plays a slight melody behind all of this. Lyrically, this song appears to be a well written poem, so I give props to the lyricist. Vocally, the chorus has a distinct trade off between Rania and E-Young that feels melded together in a blender of sexy. The verses keep a sense of urgency (to go with the tone of the song) and provide a unique feel as the instrumental doesnt slow down per say, but the vocals themselves sound delayed a bit. Right in the middle of the song we are treated to a rap portion by NaNa and Uee. The rap honestly isnt the strongest in this song and it does take away a bit; but after the rap we flow back into a solo by Rania, which then flows back into another chorus. The way the bass guitar rocks throughout this song I feel really gives the song volume; Im a bit biased because I love the bass guitar as an instrument. However, I feel it sounds &gt;great&lt; when combined with After Schools tone and vibe.

The fifth track, Love Beat, opens up with some daring echoing electronic beats behind a blaring bass. Moving into the first verse we open with some electronic voice effects as well. We open with Raina, who sings normally, but transition into Nana who has some echoing effects layered on her voice. Following this is more vocal transitions, all while the instrumental is winding up in preparation for the chorus. This wind up explodes into the chorus. Now, granted, the chorus may be the weaker part of this song. For the simple sake that the chorus may be too long and overstay its welcome. The chorus opens with Raina before transitioning to Jung Athen to Lizzy..then to NaNa..then back to Raina. It sounds solid but again, it may overstay its welcome. The instrumental during the chorus, however, is vibrant. It takes those electrical noises and plays them at different pitches. This allows the transition into the after chorus to sound a lot smoother, because I find the after chorus to actually be the highlight of this song. We are first treated to an electrical echo sung by NaNa in English. We are then treated to a mix of English and Korean sung by Uee and Ka-eun, who are supported by the constant pounding bass and repetition of the electronic sounds, which then pause and break into an instrumental that focuses on more synthesizer sounds before we enter the second verse. The second verse has the same framework as the first, and I think the songs strongest parts would be the verses and the after-chorus areas. The song does close out very well. After the final chorus we are treated to another after-chorus with Nanas electronic echos with differing lyrics, and Ka-eun closes the song altogether with some nice English. Regardless, this song sounds very club oriented; the pounding bass and electronical instrumentals seem perfect for club dancingand rightfully so, as Ive had a blast swinging my hair around to the bass and rhythm. 


The final track,    (Makeup and tears? Cried while applying makeup?) is a ballad duet with Jung A and Raina. Ballads are always very very hit or miss for me, so I will admit I put on a @_@ face when I first heard the song start up.  To open this, the lyrics are really painful for me as they hit a little close to home so it made it a little difficult to judge the song. Now, on to the vocals and instrumental.. we open up with a slight piano and into a piano with a guitar as Jung A sings our first verse. The melody is very slow and sweet, but has a very soft sound to it. Jung As voice is extremely clear here and it sounds very pure. We slowly elevate and a bass guitar (yes!) is added to the mix. The piano becomes more apparent and we move into a relaxed chorus. Jung As voice remains relatively steady throughout this entire verse.  Raina opens our next verse with all of our instruments so far. As Raina sings, however, her voice becomes more and more louder; drums are added into the mix and we hit the chorus. It is the same chorus as before, but this time Raina is singing it at a much higher and more intense pitch than Jung A. However, right as that ends we transition into an after-chorus with lyrics that are rather harsh and unforgiving. The emotion in this part from Raina is incredible. I would honestly say this part is the entire song; in retrospect it feels like the entire song slowly builds to this moment. Instruments being slowly added into the mix and Rainas voice slowly getting louder. Afterwards, the two close out the song by singing the chorus with all instrumentals on full blast, and close the song with a small piano instrumental.

I highly suggest, if you havent, you give the entire album a fair listen. You may end up liking it (at which point I suggest you purchase it as the photobook is gorgeous!). The SMOOTH vocal trade-offs in each song really show a unique strength in After School, and the amount of actual instrumental work and rhythm really came together to make this one of the more unique releases in kpop.

We are currently testing out a ""crate-style"" model where fans can subscribe to a monthly fee and receive a box full of k-pop items (possibly themed to different companies and their artists). Is this something fans would be interested in, or is it better to pick and choose?

Are there some items that you just cannot find anywhere? ie. Epik High Hat, Illionaire Hoodie, etc.

&gt;""If you promote someone who did not even help or manage things, what does that make those who stayed by my side to help and manage?  Did you make a choice based on good understanding?  Even I as a celebrity in the company do not understand this so would the fans of the company be understanding?  JYP needs a reformation in 2014.""

&gt;""The company needs to reform to become one in which people do not just insert the hours they worked but actually work hard. The entertainment company does not even entertain its employees, so how could it satisfy the public?  Whether or not the company is in the top three, it is time to not attach great importance to that title and ensure internal stability.""

&gt;""If our company wants to aim to be the best once again in 2014, I think it might not be only in the power of the producers but also in the power of the company's employees.  For the unappreciated JYP staffs who deserve the actual credit.""

I hope that you understand that the post came from a lot of affection and passion for my agency JYP to be the best. I will become a Ok Taecyeon who works hard and communicates even better with my agency""

^\(I ^combined ^user ^flairs ^belonging ^to ^the ^same ^artist. ^For ^statistics ^about ^each ^individual ^flair, ^see ^the ^raw ^data.\)

Unsurprisingly, the list is led by by artists of the most popular labels, such as SNSD and BIG BANG. In fact, SNSD flairs alone occupy three out of the top five spots, and combined have almost four times as much presence on this subreddit as the group that comes in second, 2NE1. 

If you feel like you don't see nearly as many users with SNSD flair as this list might indicate you are supposed to, keep in mind that it is a accumulation of all users that have ever assigned flair to their names, including those that only lurk and people back from the days when this subreddit was predominantly /r/snsd. 

^^^\(Also, ^^^Crayon ^^^Pop ^^^\&gt; ^^^EXO, ^^^but ^^^that ^^^should ^^^be ^^^obvious ^^^to ^^^anyone ^^^\&lt;3.\)

184,2014-1-7,2014,1,7,10,1ul2pj,/r/kpop Discussion Series: Trainees,JavelinAMX,1389056862,"So I decided to start a series of discussions based on controversial topics found in Kpop today. For my first one, I decided to talk about what some can consider the start of idoldom: the trainee process.

 

Just a few days ago, the South Korean government put legislation into place which has restrictions on young trainees promoting after 8 PM. While you can definitely get into the debate about the semantics of said law (One big loophole of the above law is that promoting after 8 needs parental permission) that isnt what Id like to touch on.

 

What Id like to talk about is whether or not the trainee process is manipulative or not. We've seen many young Korean trainees, some barely out of their pre-teens, be dropped into public light, SMROOKIES being the most recent case. We've also seen shows chronicling the lives of trainees, mostly recently YGs WINNER, that paint the trainee as rough, hard hitting and generally not very pretty. There have also been concerns that if and when trainees are put into groups, are they getting dropped into what amounts to slave contracts? The breakup of DBSK presented the fact that SM dropped the group into an unnaturally long contract and negotiated without their knowing or permission.

 

So with that in mind, I present the talking point:

1: Are companies in the wrong for placing their trainees in what is almost a Battle Royale type of situation for public sympathy, like WINNER, or getting the word out about extremely young trainees, like SMROOKIES?

290,2014-1-10,2014,1,10,16,1uv8r1,[Rumor] Taeyang's solo album to be released in Japan on March 12...could be a sign that his solo album in Korea is imminent,nobaraotome,1389338241,"http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9C%AA%E5%AE%9A-2%E6%9E%9A%E7%B5%84ALBUM-DVD-SOL-BIGBANG/dp/B00HEGA5ZI/ref=pd_sim_m_2

I was browsing Amazon Japan looking at Bigbang stuff when I came across this little interesting listing, which is for Taeyang's ""Japan solo album debut.""  Assuming that it's not apocryphal, and that they mean he's releasing new stuff, it could mean that his new solo album is coming sooner than March 12 in Korea, because usually Korean releases precede Japanese ones.  Note that the title of the album means ""To be determined.""  We shall see what happens, but this seems like it could be a good sign...

As you may know, Koreaboo is about to launch ""v2"" of our website in early February. We're about to complete the new platform and send out beta invites to all of the Redditors who have applied (in my last thread) before the end of January!

Before we do complete the project, we'd love to get input from everyone here as to what ""your perfect k-pop website"" would be.

Please be as open as you want about what you dislike or like about K-POP websites and what you REALLY want from them. Be as general as possible, or as specific! :)

We will be picking 3 people from this thread who give us the best feedback and awarding them with a gift card for our shop when it opens. :)

Hyeri is reported to have fainted on stage after Girl's Day's performance of ""Something"" on 'M! Countdown'.

After she lost consciousness, she was immediately taken to the hospital. Agency Dream Tea Entertainment stated, ""Hyeri had been suffering from the flu. She still wanted to perform, but when she went on stage, she must've been tired as she fainted. We're planning a break for her after she receives an IV drip at the hospital. She's been quickly taken to the hospital.""

Hopefully, Hyeri recovers from the flu soon and gets back to her normal self. Stay tuned for updates on Hyeri's condition!

548,2014-1-19,2014,1,19,17,1vl1uw,The dark side of Korean Society.,xmadeinchinax,1390121992,"I'm a 20 year old girl who has lived in Korea for the past 4 years. Please note I am only typing my observations, and I am not speaking to all of Korea. 
 
I have been dancing under a company, and I will say that although there are many things I love about this country, I have to say it is extremely sexist, racist, and all around a depressing place to live. 

**Girls are still considered objects here.** Sure, there is a Female President. She does not reflect on the entirety of Korean society. We are all told to be the exact same. When I first came here, I was 51kg (162cm) I was told I was fat everyday, telling me to get plastic surgery. Girls here are scared to not have boyfriends. I see their boyfriends grab the back of their girlfriend's neck, pull their hair, and forcefully push them out in public. After getting close to many Korean girls, I would have to say around 1 in 3 girls have been sexually touched by their fathers. And if a girl was raped by her father, the police wouldn't do anything about it, and if anything the girl would get in trouble for going against her father. When dancing, I am one of those people who they say has ""charisma."" However, I am constantly scolded for it everyday, which wouldn't bother me, but the boys who dance with ""charisma"" are constantly praised for it. It's basically that pretty innocent look that seems to be the only acceptable girl image. Playing dumb, using a high voice, etc...

The people here are **depressed.** They have a happy face on all the time, but the life is sucked out of them. Living here is like living in a black and white world, if you are sad or depressed nobody will care. When my best friend (who is korean.) was crying all day in the locker rooms people just walk by and don't care. If you do something that is slightly out of the ordinary you are labeled as strange. So many suicides happen everyday to a point where it's not even a big deal here. Sure you can find great friends here, but none of them will be the friends that you can really open up to and get close to. 

I have a friend who is an English teacher in Seoul, and the school scolded him for talking about genetics. Why? Because he taught the students that they were all different and unique. According to Korean society, being different is a big ""no no."" 

Again, I love Korea, however Korea has advanced faster than the people. (and the buildings, but that's not a huge deal.) Some Koreans like foreigners, but most of them think they are really loud and annoying. (If you come here, PLEASE don't yell on the subway.) Girls are very oppressed, people are depressed and have to be the same. To be honest, I could go on forever but these are the only things that come to mind as of now.  Please don't take it offensive. Again, I'm just stating my observations. ",11,0

Everything is in excellent condition! Let me know if you're interested in something or if you know a good place to sell.

I also have several posters, but they were damaged slightly on the end when I moved. I can unroll them and post photos if people are interested.

EDIT: Here's the link to my j-pop stuff :) http://www.reddit.com/r/jpop/comments/1vnrf1/selling_my_collection/

EDIT 2: Sorry guys, it looks like all the CD's are sold! I still have posters for SHINee (Ring Ding Dong, Lucifer, Hello), Sistar (shady girl), 2NE1 (1st album), and Super Junior (Bonamana).

Sajaegi wut's that

[Process of manipulating online music sources to benefit lesser known artists so that they may rise to the top of the charts](http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/37243/20130809/kpop-digital-chart-manipulation-yg-yang-hyun-suk.htm)

How you do that?

&gt;[Sajaegi is basically like buying back your own albums. How it's done is companies will take one CD, replace the barcode, record the barcode as sold, replace the barcode again, record it as sold again, and rinse and repeat with the same single](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KR2AXGUh5Bw/UuBE1IOCbII/AAAAAAAArRQ/5QCtY59u_-w/s1600/ppt02-1.jpg)

So what's up with B1A4? There was a massive spike on the voting charts (check the article) on B1A4's part.  

&gt;Their album sales ranking rose to #2 only at night with a random spike of 8,000 copies sold in the span of two hours (1/19). 

Not going to say B1A4 doesn't produce quality content (Lonely wasn't bad) but seeing this huge spike is interesting and caught attention. 

I'll update as more information is released since the company is assessing the situation at the moment.

I posted about this before and I'd like to let everyone know that all the dates and times are official now. I'd like to let you know that you're all more than welcome to come out, or if you're interested in helping out behind the scenes I'm sure something can be done!

We'll be having Miss KPop Ohio 2014 at Interbelt Nightclub in Akron Ohio on April 13th 2014. Currently there isn't a price on admission, but that is still being discussed. Expect the event to be 5-10$ entrance to 18+. 

This is going to be a hoot, having drag queens battle it out to their own KPop mixes of their favorite songs, doing their thing on stage.

Here's some information on it (mostly for drag performers) : http://i.imgur.com/6mbnwWk.jpg

We also have a facebook set up that has updated if interested.

I was wanting to do it about kpop, but wasn't sure what to do exactly and wanted your opinions.

I was thinking about doing ~5 pages. One page would be SM, one JYP, one YG, one ""other"" companies (that may not have as many groups as the ""big three""), and a page for rookies that have debuted (I was thinking last year through this year). Are there any other companies that you think deserve their own page? In addition, do you think sub-groups or solos deserve their own section or would you include them in their group's section (like Henry's Trap -&gt; his own section or include with Super Junior, 2YOON -&gt; their own section or with 4Minute?) Would you also include OST releases or just studio albums/singles?

In the pages, I was planning on having a breakdown for each group and including the debuts and comebacks of each group, and then analyzing the amount of comeback time for groups as they become more well-known and popular.

Any suggestions on where to get a list of all of the comebacks/debuts in the last year? Of course, I'm going to include the big ones for the big groups all the way back, there with so many debuts, it's difficult to keep track of them, which is a reason why I'm taking on this challenge. I think it could be an interesting topic to try. My professor already approved it and he said he's never seen a topic like this, so I really want to impress him.

I think it'd also be good because I'm thinking about trying to find a job in Korea post-graduation, and this could potentially aid me. Thanks everyone!

As a part of BBC Radio 1's Access All Areas Month, I have been given the opportunity to host one of the 36 one hour shows available. Now it wont be broadcast live but some clips might make it into a one hour special. 

In the UK i feel people think that Kpop is just PSY. While I know he is a big i want to showcase some other acts.

I have come up with a  provisional playlist I am going to use, but i would like some advice/suggestions from the community, I want to represent us as best as possible.

The playlist as of now is:

I Got a Boy - SNSD

Growl - EXO

The Chaser - Infinite

Rum Pum Pum Pum - f(x)

Mr. Simple - Super Junior

Rignt Now - PSY

Abracadabra - Brown Eyed Girls

I Am the Best - 2NE1

This isn't the final list by far, Please leave me some other song ideas, or any changes you might make? Also any topics you might think would be good to bring up?

Many Thanks, and I will be sure to post a link to the full show when I get it.
