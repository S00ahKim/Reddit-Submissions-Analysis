I even have it downloaded on my phone as well, yet I still seem to forget this amazing song exists the majority of the time. 

There are other songs where this happens for me, notable examples are [Playback's 'Isn't There'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzlMsvF73tE), [24K's 'Super Fly'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnmLjdvTeCE) and [CLC's 'Pepe'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qmsJbJasfo).

For example, SNSD appeared on the David Letterman show a while back, a huge talk show in the US, and IGAB was being advertised (not played. The album was being advertised in a commercial) on two of the most popular Pop stations in LA for about a month. Korean media picked up on this, especially the David Letterman thing, and made it sound like SNSD did REALLY well. In actuality, nothing seemed to really change for the group. I didn't hear about them ever again in American media, minus those that cover KPop exclusively.

All I hear in korean shows and korean media is that KPop is supremely popular around the world and [group name]'s show sold out in [short amount of time] in [foreign country]. 

So my question is, how popular are Kpop groups REALLY outside of Korea? ",58,25

Upon some discussion and permissions with /u/mwff, the creator of the themed playlists two years ago, we agreed that with the ever growing community and changing depth of Kpop, the playlists could see some updating.

I'm going to change it up a bit from last time, as I will repeat previously used themes for the weeks, but will also let the community vote on some upcoming themes. As well, you can PM me if you have any ideas for weekly themes, and I'll throw them up to be voted on!

The nominations will be in contest mode, so you won't be swayed by upvotes and the most popular won't be at the top. Try to nominate and vote for all the songs you'd like to see included!

If you have any further questions, feel free to send me a message and I'll try to answer it as soon as possible.

------------------------

##**So here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **(Friday, January 8th, 11:59pm PST)**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make YouTube and Spotify playlists and begin the next week.

--------------

This week's theme is **Cheerful / Mood Lifting**. That are, happy Kpop songs that cheer you up and ones that make you feel good whenever you listen to them.

To vote for upcoming themes, click [here](http://strawpoll.me/6424958).

Edit (160109): Just waiting on some work to be done on the contest mode, playlist will be up whenever after some technical work.

145,2016-1-4,2016,1,4,12,3zd1n3,[WARNING] Kpopme scamming VIP ticket holders for Apink Vancouver concert,CommanderVinegar,1451878462,"Not sure which sub this would be most relevant to but I feel like fans of kpop should be warned about this event hosting company.


To make a long story short Kpopme confirmed that all VIP ticket holders would be eligible to win 1 of 150 hi-touch passes to meet Apink at the Vancouver concert. Tickets began selling in November so of course my friends and I jumped on it so we could get some prime seating. Collectively we dropped over $600 for the tickets. The thought of being able to meet Apink drove us through our finals. Flash forward to today, we flew out from Calgary to Vancouver only to find out that they reduced the number of hi-touch passes from 150 to 100 and they've excluded VIP ticket holders from rows 12-14 from the draw to win them. Note that this change was made after the tickets were sold and as far as I'm aware there was no major announcement regarding this change.


Of course not everyone who purchased a VIP ticket would be able to win, that's not the issue, but considering there were 300 VIP tickets most people would have a decent chance. That is of course assuming that everyone was actually entered in the draw. Despite the 3 of my friends and I (and everyone from rows 12-14) paying for the same $150 ticket that the people in rows 6-11 paid for we weren't included in the draw at all.

All the winners of the hi-touch passes are from rows 6-11 which would be damn near impossible if winners were randomly chosen from a pool of all 300 of the VIP ticket holders. But hey at least we get a signed poster /s


EDIT: Just to show I'm not just some angry dude pulling shit out of his ass [here's the official winners list.](https://www.facebook.com/events/412206718987741/permalink/439681139573632/)


EDIT 2: Currently at the show, the signed posters were given out to anyone who asked for them. I asked the staff handing out the posters if they needed to see my ticket and they said that they didn't need to check. They simply asked if I already won hi-touch and hat was it. The posters weren't actually autographed either they were just mass produced event posters with the autographs of the members added in digitally. So to everyone flaming me do you still think my anger isn't justified?",24,59

This only caused uproar because Chris Brown's twitter [doesn't follow anyone else](http://imgur.com/YdzG69o) - so when the one person was a random stan of BTS everyone was like ??? including the [fan herself.](https://twitter.com/fcxkbts/status/681872486741446656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)


Quite frankly I don't really care about Chris Brown/like him very much as a person or musicially, but I thought it was kind of funny and did give BTS a bit of free press. The account itself gained thousands of followers and I even saw a few articles written about the mishap.

I think the whole 2pm debacle was for the better. The heavy, muscle bound members would have a hard time keeping up with the slick and fluid choreography that jay park does so effortlessly. Plus, he would not get the chance to shine as the singing lines would be divided among the members and the song itself be heavily regulated for a widespread audience. At this point, the only edge 2pm has is its jyp connection and being one of the pioneer 2nd generation kpop groups. Kind of unfair though because no matter how bad the actual content of the album is, brand recognition always translates into sales while jay park works his ass off to make good music and choreography for a  kinda niche audience. In terms of a solo artist, is jay park selling well?",7,0

An industry insider stated that Hyomin was planned to have her comeback in February, but it was pushed back to March because of Chinese promotions.

I just got back from the Infinite concert in Vancouver. I am posting this as awareness for terrible event organizing. I know there were a couple issues with KpopMe for Apink's concert. This is a post of what went wrong with Dilemma for Infinite's concert.

Let's start with the obvious: the concert itself was great and Infinite was *amazing*. No doubt that I had a blast. I wish this concert organization went a lot smoother.

First off, this is what the VIPs were promised in the package:

- One reserved ticket in rows 1-3 on the floor
- Commemorative VIP laminate and lanyard
- Exclusive INFINITE gift 
- Early entrance into the venue
- Crowd free merchandise shopping 30 minutes before the venue opens

This would be all fine, if we actually got what we paid for.

The tickets were reserved for the first 3 rows. Okay, good.

We sort of got early entrance. There were no lines outside. When it came closer to the time for the doors to open for VIPs (6:30pm), fans all started lining up without any personnel outside. We just had to assume, with what was going on inside the doors. What was going on was that they started setting up for entrance ~15mins before doors open. That's fine. It was unorganized, but it doesn't matter as much.

Once we got in, we received our laminate and lanyard. That's good. However, we noticed something...

There were no merchandise booths. At all. We had to ask the theatre staff what was going on. They basically replied that there was no merchandise and they can't help. Maybe it got stuck at the border; they don't know. We were shocked. We paid for crowd-free merchandise shopping, but there wasn't even any merchandise. We asked if there was an event organizer representative from Dilemma. Answer: nope. We were stuck with nothing.

What about our exclusive gifts? Nope. Again, nothing. This is ridiculous. It is part of the package and everyone was looking forward to it.

I know that there are circumstances that could arise to prevent these things from happening. However, *the most* frustrating part was that Dilemma never made an official statement or apology. We were left in the dark until we had sought out answers for ourselves. They have not addressed it. I am quite sure that they knew of the merchandise issue beforehand, but they didn't say anything about it. Even just an hour before the concert, Dilemma posted, ""We are READY!!!!"" and ""Enjoy the show :)"". They were not ready.

This was not even just an issue for the VIPs. A lot of fans expected to buy merchandise and were planning to buy lightsticks at the venue (as is normal with most concerts). It made me sad to see that the audience wasn't filled with a sea of lightsticks. Some fans had brought some, but for those that didn't, it was disappointing.

This also all means that we were let into the venue 30mins early just to stand and wait to file in with the rest of the crowd.

I am very upset with Dilemma's event organization (or lack thereof). I wish it went better. I enjoyed Infinite, but not the whole concert experience.

**Edit:** I did send an email to Dilemma as soon as I got home. Let's hope they address these issues.

**Edit:** It seems some people are also emailing Ticketmaster. I think this is a good idea.",28,32

476,2016-1-9,2016,1,9,15,4058ap,Pink Memory - Apink North American Tour Vancouver review,siekooc,1452320312,"There has been a couple posts that mention the tour and there was the vancity buzz link that basically just linked someones ig of the concert and people wanted a better review, so I thought I would celebrate the end of syllabus week with this write up. 

**SKIP THIS PART IF YOU DONT CARE ABOUT WHERE IM COMING FROM**

First some background on my perspective. I'm not really a fan of big stadium concerts cause they are really hit or miss with me. I like festival kinda shows like the MuDo music festivals (2013 was one of my favorite live events I've attended) and concerts that are basically show cases. JT and Jay Z in LA was really dope and i enjoyed that vibe but I dont think I could get behind a full scale stadium for something super poppy but thats just me. But also at the same time I guess seating has a lot to do with it. 

Basically what I want to say is that I've been to a MuDo festival, Music bank/core/show and there specials, JT Jay Z, and apink at this point and those will be what I use as comparisons and etc. 

**Actual concert review**

I will be going through the entire experience since that will give the most whole some review. There will be headers so just skip to whatever you care about. 

**Ticket Purchase**

Holy did meet and greet tickets go out fast. We were running 6 different laptops trying to snag 3x1 3x2 tickets and we didnt get a single one. But given the limited amount thats to be expected. The tickets were basically split up into VIP MnG, VIP, Regular and regular seats being spread out and prices differing depending on location. My friend wanted VIP seats and he got them but Im not that hypy at concerts anyways so I chose front row balcony which are more my pace. The price difference was I think 50 dollars between us? (not sure going off of memory) and honestly the pricing was fair imo. VIP you get a chance at high touch pass and you get a tour poster which is nice. Kpopme (the event organizers) said they were trying to get more high touch passes and that something happened but there was no follow up on that that I am aware of and there was a reddit post saying how rows of vip got screwed out of a chance of getting passes. Eh that post was ok it seemed hostile af but I feel like the person just missed a post or something but Kpopme just didnt make it obvious. Didn't seem like he tried to get in contact but who knows. Shit happens and if event organizers aren't trying to max dollars then we wouldnt get events anyways. Better than that BTS(??? not sure) concert fiasco thats for sure. 

TL;DR Ticket process was good, miscommunication between leon and organizers probably led to hitouch fuck up, kpopme didnt really try to fix it to much but oh well. 

***note:*** Some people might say im letting kpopme off too easily and yeah I agree I am but we don't really know whos fault it is anyways. Plus you dont buy floor seats for a CHANCE to meet the girls. You buy them cause your into being part of the hype crowd and want to enjoy the concert like that. 

**Line Up and Pre-show**

Prenote: vancouver does not know how to fucking line up for anything besides for boxing day sales. And thats only when directed by a security guard or someone else. 

The line-up is second hand information since I had just regular tickets so i showed up later. 

Apparently a gaggle of people started forming early like 5 but no real line and since Orpheum has TWO entrances and it wasn't made clear about which one to line up at it was a mess. I know of regular ticket holders that waited outside the correct door and was let in early with vip ticket holders so thats just a huge fuck up. The staff definitely should have arranged it somehow but I think thats the limitation of the venue itself. The Orpheum is a theater for symphonies and the like where you shouldn't be lining up for an hour before the show so you can get merch. Honestly I got there and I really missed Korea and Japan for the lines for events. I think I got there at 6:20 and just walked in through the second entrance that was opened after the first ""main"" entrance was opened. 

Needless to say all the non light stick merch was sold before I got to the table and I didnt see enough of the merch during or after the concert to make me believe they were interested in selling all too much. But the light sticks were dope. 

Basically the line up and EARLY entrance benefits are all a lie and the event staff (orpheum staff) probably didnt know what was going on at all. non-lightstick merchandise was not a priority on this tour so dont expect to get any unless you real lucky and dedicated.

Girls were amazingggggggg. Its been a while since I last saw them at any event and it was just so good to see Rongleader in person again. Fan service was dominated by Eunji and Bomi like usual but all the girls did there best during the in between sections. 

Naeun english rocked, Eunji was amazing with just everything she does,  and I just love the group even more now. This is honestly the part of  the concert I least remember in detail cause I was just enjoying the moment. The QA was interesting, but the game they played was probably the best part. They did the thing where you put your hand in a box to guess what is in it. They were separated into older younger groups. Actually this is a guy time for me to copy paste something i posted earlier. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complaint about event mc: 

You know the mc who has the voice where you know thats not their real voice and hes just using it for this event to sound more cool or what not. He had that going on. And maybe he wasn't part of the script writing but the script was not the best thing in the world and to be honest quite bad. He had an agenda that he wanted to keep with so even when the girls were using there best english and trying to come up with more to say (god bless eunji) he would cut them off and its the awkard thing where he doesnt do it on purpose so he stops but then the girls stop and then he starts but the girls start at the same time.

Yeah just not a real mc and he did his best i guess.

Also i had an issue with the translators cause it was realllyy noticibly scripted. As in I guess there answers were predetermined and the questions were live which are fair i guess but it bothers me when the translations dont line up that well with the answers but thats just me being nitpicky. The guy translator was actually probably my favorite of the three onstage staff members.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bring this up now because the inbetween sections are what make or break a show case in my opinion. Or else it just becomes a music show with one group which isnt bad but you pay for a concert for the fan interaction. Besides for the mc complains above I am going to go a bit deeper into my issues with the translators. The guy translator was fine. He was there helping the girls understand what the main mc was saying, whispering with them, giving quick translations to any live remarks they made BUT his counter part was obviously just in it for the script. Idk if theres a vod of the QnA but if anyone else watches one and does translation work they might be a bit peeved and perplexed at the answers she gives. I think the best way to explain it is when I translate I like to keep the vibe and feeling of the original statement as much as I can. Korean to English can be tricky at times but there answers werent but instead of saying Chorong likes to stay home on her day offs and just relax she says something like Chorong likese to be lazy on her days off and stay home. Idk it irks me but its not a big deal I guess. BUT THE BIG ONE. They dont translate certain things for some reason. Its one thing for not translating the games for them before to keep it a suprise but not explain it to them as soon as they are setting up kinda irks me. It worked out eventually which is all that matters but yeah they also chose not to explain  and  (how they split up the members and just named them but never really explained the terms which seems weird) 

But kpopme staff aside the performances were amazing. I think they had 3 costumes and they did my favorite one which made me happy and overall great set by the girls. Hayoung didnt fall over during remember which is a plus &gt;.&gt; and the fan service they gave during the performances were great. Eunji interacted with all the fans. I remember someone yelled i love you and she said i love you too. 

Honestly just having the girls there interacting in english made the show completely worth it for me. 



Um sorry for my decline in writing as the post went on, I just got back from school and gym so im pretty pooped and im just looking to sleep. Shoot me a question or anything if you want me to answer stuff. 

And anyone who is going to the rest of the tour have a good time~~

497,2016-1-10,2016,1,10,5,407tr0,What are some notable member changes in Kpop groups?,kroo_bucket,1452369981,"It seems like every idol group has had lineup changes, I think they're very interesting because how things could have gone so differently.


Besides from groups like DBSK (TVXQ and JYJ), After School, UKISS and EXO, what are some notable changes that could have seriously affected a group if it didn't go the way it did?



The ones I can recall are:


Hyuna from 4Minute was originally in Wonder Girls. Can you imagine 4Minute without Hyuna? Me neither.


Soyou (from SISTAR) and Ga-yoon (from 4Minute) were supposed to debut as a duo, then Soyou was supposed to debut with 4Minute but ultimately got cut.


B2ST's Jang HyungSeung (also in Troublemaker with Hyuna) was originally going to debut with Big Bang, but ultimately got cut instead of Seungri. Imagine Big Bang without Seungri or BEAST without Jang HyungSeung.


And before all that, GDragon and Taeyang were supposed to be duo instead of a group.


EXID and Bestie from start to finish (meaning from when they were trainees, to actually splitting members up when debuting.) The most surprising was that Hyorin was under JYP and could have debuted in a group outside of SISTAR.",133,58

Due to last-minute circumstances I'm in possession of an extra VIP (GA Standing Tier 2) ticket that is basically going to waste.

So I figured it'd be instead nicer to give it to someone who really wants to go but couldn't from the reddit.

You can even come with my group, but we might embarrass you with our Pink Chorong and Bomi shirts.

522,2016-1-10,2016,1,10,13,409si3,I ended up on a flight with APINK today from SFO to LAX. Was cash.,ultrauber,1452398500,"Sup /r/kpop, very casual lurker here. I'm a Korean major at USC and although my interest is more in history and language, I keep up with kpop a little bit, so imagine my surprise when I got on the plane this morning and saw APINK sitting in first class!

... kinda. Actually, I was sitting at the gate when I overheard a group of Koreans nearby, so I started eavesdropping for practice, like I do. I thought it was sort of weird that all these girls were acting bossy toward their boyfriends, who referred to them with honorific speech ( etc).

They boarded first and when I walked by them in first class I noticed that the girls in the group were (obvs) hella stylish, not just in an ""I'm rich"" way but in a ""I have a personal fashion designer"" kinda way. I had a moment like ""Holy shit isn't that a famous girl group on my flight right now?"" because they looked familiar. But I didn't want to stare, so I chalked it up to me being bad at telling Koreans apart, went to my seat and chilled. 

I should add that only three of them were on my flight. I didn't look at all of them but I think it was the [4th and 5th one](http://apink.kpopme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/EDITEDPOSTER.jpg) in this photo and one other.

Anyway so when we got of the plane I ended up right behind them walking down one of those really long hallways they have at LAX. At one point I tripped (I know, I'm hecka cool) and the ""boyfriend"" who was walking with the girl in front of me *immediately* turned around and shot me a glare. Like, lightning reflexes. In retrospect, I guess that's because he was a bodyguard. All of the bodyguards were pretty low-key, dressed plainly and not especially huge. They clearly knew exactly what they were doing. It was clutch.

At the end of the hallway where it spills into the baggage claim and there is the ""no re-entry"" door they grouped up with the rest of the band and misc support people, maybe 15 or so (I guess they had to take separate flights. It was a PITA for me to get this ticket and that was like 2 months ago haha and I don't fly first class) and I started to have a ""holy shit wait it's actually them?"" moment. When I walked through the door there were all these fans waiting with signs saying ""Welcome to LA Apink!"" and cameras and stuff. I was like, dope. Maybe some of you guys were there?

I decided not to talk to them because I understand that being a celebrity is stressful and I wanted to respect their space. LOL JK I JUST CHICKENED OUT. But here's a stalker photo I took from my Uber while leaving:

But the list was mainly going off of current successes and popularity. Some groups are popular but don't make the top 10 cut. My example would be Monsta X, not quite good enough to reach my top 10 but I do believe they've caught enough traction to gain a lot of popularity this year.

544,2016-1-11,2016,1,11,1,40c1m3,How do you think bad k-pop debuts/comebacks happen?,skaterdog,1452445101,"As I write this, I realize it's a pretty broad topic with a lot of possible angles to come from. I wrote ""bad"" in the title, but I think ""unpopular"" would work just as well. 

   To illustrate my point, two examples: Berry Good debuted with [Love Letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pYziw7QGOI&amp;ab_channel=OfficialChannelBERRYGOOD) which is by all accounts a by the books debut song, but it was good. Cute choreography, singers and rappers equally shined and a well-made MV. The group didn't gain a ton of popularity but it was a solid debut. Their next comeback was [Because of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ITfI3XC-3Q&amp;ab_channel=1theK(%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4). I think anyone could see this was a downgrade from the perspective of trying to gain popularity. I don't claim to understand what Berry Good and their team has dreams of musically, but if their goal is to become the next SNSD isn't it obvious this entire promotion was a total waste of time? How many groups really explode off a...ballad(?), especially a ballad with a lack of any powerhouse vocals. The MV is a downgrade in quality, as they sacrificed polish and a potential narrative for location. I'm trying to speak objectively here, right, that Because of You is significantly worse when compared to Love Letter if you try to look at marketability. I wonder how the decision to go through with this comeback was made by the company.

   Then there is also the contention that if a group like AOA came out with Dal Shabet's Joker, the song would have been huge. While that could be true in some alternate universe, the fact is that AOA would never sing a song like Joker in the first place. After looking at AOA's releases since Miniskirt, it's hard to pick a weak one. I feel the same way about SISTAR since So Cool and Girl's Day since Expectation (this is outside of personal opinion here, I simply mean that all their comebacks since *that* comeback have been successful and generated good buzz). On the other hand, Dal Shabet seems to always straddle a line between moderate success and forgettable-ness. They have not been nominated or won an award since 2013, and their 2013 award was a [homeshopping music award](http://www.soompi.com/2013/12/31/dal-shabets-have-dont-have-ranks-first-at-2013-home-shopping-music-awards/)  (LOL, gives me Crayon Pop vibes). Mr. Bang Bang, Hit U and Have, Dont Have were so early 2000s k-pop. Even if you may not enjoy their old songs now, in the time that they came out they were decently successful and fit the flavor of music being released. [Be Ambitious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtMbtq8wT0&amp;ab_channel=1theK(%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4) totally has that ""we could have gone big from this"" vibe to it. The sexy choreography is just enough and the song is upbeat in a safe, but not boring way. The video has colors that pop and the members look great. [B.B.B.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGKeA3xUzxU&amp;ab_channel=1theK(%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4) is a respectable effort and strays from the norm in its retro sound. A comeback that challenges expectations and matures the image of Dal Shabet is worth applauding. :) 

   So how the heck does a group on a small-scale, but certainly upward trend come up with Joker? The biggest sins Joker committed were its poor English lines (maybe just for me as an international fan) and too sexy choreography. It wasn't Marionette levels of in-your-face, but I do believe that for groups that are not already popularity, the sexuality of the live stages can play a big part in how they are perceived: a group genuinely trying to succeed or a group who is trying to cheese their way to five minutes of fame. The [controversy]( http://www.koreaboo.com/buzz/dalshabets-joker-banned-korean-media-not-reason-thought/) surrounding the lyrics surely didnt help their promotions.
Does a bad song make a group look bad? Do mediocre groups just attract less inventive songs?
I like Dal Shabet, but Joker is just a bland song (especially to bank on it after waiting a little over a year to comeback). Berry Goods two latest comebacks since debut have been slow, ballad-type songs. The significance of the songs aside, they are pretty obviously not songs that would launch a new group into limelight. Compare this to the consistently strong discography of SNSD. Is SNSD more talented than Dal Shabet and Berry Good? Perhaps, but singing is both innate talent and trained skill. Does SNSD have a better team supporting them which only come up with good songs? This is more believable to me, and then it truly begs me to ask the question of why!? Why do companies take talented, hardworking groups and ship them out with songs that are simply not up to caliber. If it takes trainees years to debut, you would imagine theyd put at least half that much effort into coming up with a proper comeback/debut. 

   I hope a cool discussion can arise from this. One thing I know I totally ignored is promotions outside of music, like on variety. Dal Shabet is going to be on Weekly Idol which will definitely help them promote Naturalness. I don't follow Korean media outside of K-pop all that much so maybe there's a correlation between a newbie group's success and their outside promotions someone can enlighten me about. ",25,21

I'm sure I was probably the only one who recognized them, but I was suprised kpop would even show up. Although CNN has probably covered something on kpop, just not for a segment for students.

DSP has not confirmed or denied this but all signs seem to point to this actually being true.

Visual Glow (Rainbow's biggest international fansite) posted the original [Instagram update](https://twitter.com/VisualGlow/status/686910280866070528) and [also stated](https://twitter.com/VisualGlow/status/686915256728317952) that DSP is working with the same producers from Innocent, particularly those that produced Bad Man Crying. I can't confirm the validity of the second claim but Visual Glow tends to only post information that they know is accurate.

From my personal observation, Rainbow have been lightening up on personal schedules/outside work and have posted a lot more updates from the gym/working out, so it would make sense that they're in the process of preparing for a comeback.

Now this isnt too say that tapping into a market and making money is bad because only a fool would say that, but going through the threads i saw tons of people correct many on China's music market and after research i found out myself that the statements were true

Chinas music market isnt even close to as good as South Koreas and then that doesnt even make a dent in how huge Japan is as a market...

So then i did some more research and contacted some friends at college who are from SK and they said Koreans dont like it at all when groups focus efforts in China...they feel like the groups are abandoning them to make a quick buck

And even with EXID recently just mentioning they are making a Chinese album koreans werent happy about it.

Basically what im getting at is in your honest opinion do you think its better for a group to focus on domestic ties and making sure that is stable before they attack another market?",10,0

http://onehallyu.com/topic/269959-tzuyu-nationality-issue-escalates/

Basically, JYPE doesn't want to choose sides and be involved in politics when they're entertainment company.

* That means Anhui TV can ban them. A temporary ban can even last few years.
* Hunan TV also stated that they won't support pro independence activitists - Twice - but we don't know what about other JYPE artists. Khun appeared recently on Hunan TV's show and **Jackson was going to MC Day Day Up and was invited to film for 2 days after he trended on weibo, but it was changed to guesting and recording for 3h.**
* JYPE artists are being attacked on their weibo accounts

For me, it's Wonder Girls' Yeeun. When I was just a casual listener of WG I didn't even care much about her, but after I became a fan and learned more about them, her personality was the one that stood out the most, especially after reading [those](http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/72525/interview-yeeun-talks-about-her-struggles-in-the-past) [three](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/16653452.html) [interviews](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/13949150.html) (the later two are pretty long, but it's an interesting read). Yeeun isn't afraid to be ambitious in a country and industry where women aren't particularly encouraged to be overachievers and to do their own thing. She shows much interest to work behind the scenes instead of just doing other people's songs and fought with JYP himself to release her solo mini album exactly the way she wanted. And she's so honest and well spoken too! I won't be surprised if the takes over an important role in JYPE after WG is done, maybe even succeed the man himself.",41,11

3. Esp for the artist involved is only 16. Her age and educational level hasn't developed well for any political views

4. Untrue statements affect our work in china, and cause inconvenience to our work with our partners in china

if this belongs in kpop slumber party ill delete and repost there ; u;

here are mine!

**Happy:** *Genie/Gee* - might be a generic sone kind of thing but it just reminds of snsd back then and ofc jessica

**Pumped:** *Dope/IGAB* - idno its self-explanatory, theyre both high tempo hype-y songs!!

**Motivated:** *Party* - (look at me im soshi trash) i just listen to this and just makes me wanna DO smth w/ my life i mean look @ that mv i should be partying like they are

**Sad/Tear jerker??? idk**:  *Butterfly/Paper Planes/INTW (does this count?? i know its a cover BUT u kno)* - (im also bts trash) Butterfly because the lyrics make me feel really sad, also just the way the sing it in general, paper planes bc jungkooks voice is angelic, INTW because im that typical sone who cries at their debut song",13,0

908,2016-1-16,2016,1,16,0,413frk,JYP releases his own apology on Weibo,ThatDangDoe,1452870322,"Hi everyone, I am J.Y. Park.
 
First of all, in regards to the pain brought on to the Chinese netizens, I wholeheartedly express a deep apology. At the same time, I feel regretful that my company staff, Tzuyu and I did not realize the seriousness of this incident. In regards to that, I express my apologies again.
 
Through this incident, I have once again deeply experienced that, to partner up with a nation, there is a need to respect that nation's sovereignty, culture, history, and the people's emotions.
 
Everything that has happened has taught my company and the company's artists a very big lesson. In the future, we will firmly put an end to having this kind of an incident occurring.
 
Again, I express my apologies to all Chinese fans who have continuously liked and supported me, my company, and the company's artists. We let everyone down and hurt everyone's heart. To make up for all the damages done to everyone, and  return everyone's support, we will continue to work hard and contribute to the friendly cultural exchange between China and Korea.
 
In the past few days, Tzuyu herself has felt a lot of emotions, and has been reflecting. She left home when she was 13 and came to Korea, and it is my and the company's big fault for not being able to cultivate Tzuyu in place of her mom and dad. We will stop all of Tzuyu's current activities in China, and effectively handle all of the issues with the affected parties due to this incident.

__Quick recap if you don't want to go through all the links:__

&gt;For those of you who are interested this is what happened yesterday:
 
&gt;Huang An took to his Weibo account saying Tzuyu is a Taiwan independent supporter, as she held a Taiwan flag on My Little Television, also she always says she is from Taiwan and when MC/colleagues add in China-Taiwan she doesn't acknowledge it.
 
&gt;Huang An is from Taiwan but he does not support Taiwan being independent. He's a singer with 2 million followers on Weibo, he isn't that influential. It's just that with the upcoming elections China's government has come down hard and stated that anyone that supports Taiwan being an independent nation should not be allowed to appear on public media. Which is why when Huang An digs out people, there are a lot of people supporting his views.
 
&gt;She has been trending for 3 days now on Weibo, for those that may not know trending for 3 days on Weibo is almost unheard of as most topics move down quite fast due to new things popping up.
 
&gt;This issue has escalated really quickly in the last 2 days resulting in:
 
&gt;1. Twice recording for the Bei Jing Spring Festival Gala will be edited out 
2. Twice was invited to the An Hui Spring Festival Gala, that is now removed
3. Twice CF deal with LG + Huawei has been terminated
4. Kuwo music (China's version of Spotify with over 1 million app downloads) has removed all JYP artist songs and music videos
5. Kugou music (Same deal as Kuwo) has removed all of Twice songs and music videos
6. Hunan TV (The channel that a lot of Kpop artists appear on) has voiced they will not be inviting supporters of Taiwan independence to their shows
 
&gt; As a result of this Netiizens in China are now voicing for all JYP artist to be banned from China.

i think:

nu abo and red light by f(x) (RL looks easy but is actually complex)

me gustas tu by gfriend

eat you up by boA

be natural by red velvet

like this by wonder girls

and the obligatory first love by after school


note: hard does not equal cool, fun, nice to watch, etc per se. I'm just asking for hard dances

thoughts? and also add yours!

Another week has passed and I must thank you all again for all your responses for for last week's playlist! For about 285 nominations, a playlist of 143 songs was formed.

There's a small issue that I must bring up, is that not enough people are voting for songs! It's a bit time consuming but if you want certain songs on this playlist, browse around the thread and vote for songs that you would like to be on the playlist. It's also a way to find some new songs and artists that you might enjoy!

You can find the previous weeks' playlists here: 

**[\[Week 1 - Cheerful / Mood Lifting\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgv8bKfxEs&amp;list=PLzpC_yk4IDHg9jrbVhcXJ91Kq7T_jcfSP)**

**[\[Week 2 - Sad / Heartbroken\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjtCQvQftdB1M8FVTpm42Xc)**

-----------------

Now moving on to Week 3! This week's theme is **Hip-Hop + R&amp;B**. For all the Korean hip-hop enthusiasts as well as the smooth R&amp;B vibes, nominate Kpop songs that fits the genre!

------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **(Saturday, January 23th, 11:59pm PST)**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

Another upcoming weekly theme has been voted in, and it is **Kpop B Songs (Songs that aren't promoted on albums)**. This will be included soon in the future.

Upcoming themes are:

* Hip-Hop + R&amp;B

* Workout / Hype

* Dance and Uptempo (Party!)

* Chill / Mellow

* Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs

* Kpop B Songs (Songs that aren't promoted on albums)


To vote for upcoming themes, click [here](http://strawpoll.me/6563229).

If you have any other ideas for upcoming themes, feel free to PM me and I'll include them next week.

----------

Again, thank you all for your participation. Remember to vote and nominate songs you'd like to see!

*Edit: I understand that this topic can go sour very quickly as people can be very defensive about their biases, but the point of this question wasn't to start shit. I wanted to know the opinions of people since I'm still relatively new to kpop and don't know that much about all the groups. There are some simple truths that some people are worse vocalists than others (but can still be good in their own right) and I was hoping this thread could bring me some insight. I know knetz can be very over the top on things and I thought that this could be a place of proper discussion but hey, welcome to the internet. =/",46,0

1111,2016-1-19,2016,1,19,9,41m24g,[Discussion] This subreddit needs to do some maturing,TonerKebab,1453164652,"Based on the comments I've read today, it seems y'all are failing to promote alternative viewpoints. In fact, I can lump you all into certain groups regarding the topic of sexuality and abuse in Kpop.

1. Absolutely believe that Kpop companies are run by degenerates who abuse and force their idols to do concepts and things they don't want to. In more extreme cases, high-end prostitution and casting couch abuse while auditioning.

2. Are in absolute denial about any of that. When Dal Shabet's former member (whose story is on the front page right now) brought forth her accusation, this group blurted out that they need more proof or that she's a drama queen who's falsely accusing her former company for attention. Even worse are the comments saying that ""she looked into it"" during the scene. Like how would you know?

3. The apologists who have entered the Stellar camp as of late. I love Stellar as a group and think Vibrato is one of the top two songs of 2015, but when I posted (which got deleted because of an editorialized title) a video of them being literally paraded in front of their fans and being made to make cute, cute-sexy and ""sexy-sexy"" poses - all the comments were like ""they chose to do this."" That may be true, but that doesn't make the spectacle any less tacky. Being told that Dal Shabet did something similar a little while back doesn't change matters - it was a tacky display for horny fans. I have no problem with sexuality in any form but I feel they deserve to transcend the ""auction peep show"" style of promotion.

I'm going to generalize a bit here and assume most of you are teenagers who don't full comprehend the need for alternative viewpoints and open discussion. Despite me having an opinion in point 3, I fully welcomed any reasonable argument for the contrary. However, it seems that anyone who goes against the norm on r/kpop gets heavily downvoted while the fanboying/fangirling comments are on top of each thread. Can we not continue this spiral which will turn us into some shitty Allkpop forum?

I'm currently doing a Master's in Communications and Media Studies and it's come to the time where we pick our dissertation/thesis topics and go with them after being assigned a supervisor.

The head of the department is one of my professors and she heard me talking about Kpop to a classmate. During a meeting we had, she brought it up and was impressed with how much random stuff I knew about it. She strongly suggested that I pursue an aspect of it for my Master's dissertation.

Now this is a pretty daunting task, writing 15,000 words on a subject and bringing something new to the table for the reviewers. I wanted to focus on the songwriting aspect of Kpop, as I write songs myself and was primarily drawn to Kpop producers and their influences (80s etc.) but there aren't many sources I can use to write a whole dissertation on that.

Most journal articles on Kpop seem to be about the subculture, the fandom, marketing, globalisation and sexuality/asexuality. (the last one was the major focus of a lecture we had on Kpop) Since I'm fairly certain I can't do mine on the songwriting/influences, what would /r/kpop recommend me to pursue? 

tl;dr: Need to write thesis/dissertation, would kindly like suggestions for topics I can pursue from you all.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the great suggestions. I'll have a follow up on this in a few weeks and I can foresee coming back for advice/questions in the coming months as I write this. ",71,57

- 2NE1 - I Am The Best. (Let's be honest, everyone knew this would be here before even opening the thread)

- 2PM - Go Crazy.

- B.A.P - Warrior.

- Big Bang - Fantastic Baby. (When it kicks in live, hearing GD's intro lines sounds twice as epic with the crowd repeating them)

- f(x) - NU ABO. (The synth riff launching into the steady groove of the song.)

- Shinee - Lucifer. (There was no way this wouldn't make this list.)

- Super Junior - Sorry Sorry.

- T-ara - One &amp; One. (The robotic ""we are the one and one"" launching into the chants. This song screams attitude even if it makes no sense)

Tablo is hosting a radio broadcast every thursday 9PM ET/6PM PT starting today for international fans! His first broadcast is going on right now. Broadcast is in English! Come tune in!

Direct link may not work in chrome (at least it didn't for me). It might take you to the homepage of Dashradio, just type YG or HIGHGRND in the search bar and enjoy! [more info](http://www.icaruswalks.com/highgrnd-launches-radio-for-international-fans/)

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE: So at the end of the show Tablo said it might not be every thursday :( I'll try to keep an eye out for an official date for the next HIGHGRND broadcast and post it a couple days in advance so more people can tune in

&amp;nbsp;

For anyone that missed the broadcast, someone on tumblr recorded it and also made a transcript [Source](http://highgrndradio.tumblr.com/post/137796578273/episode-1-transcript)",8,13

1405,2016-1-23,2016,1,23,17,42a5ci,Kpop Badge on Sporcle,DontBeABillHader,1453539126,"Hello, all! I'm the curator for the kpop subcategory over on Sporcle. Sporcle is a quiz site where users submit quizzes in many different categories for people to play -- it's a lot more fun and addicting than it sounds! The kpop subcategory can be found [here](http://www.sporcle.com/games/subcategory/kpop) if anyone wants to take a look (and if anyone wants to nominate a game for me to feature, let me know!).

Basically, I'm here to ask for help. On Sporcle, there are achievements you can win called badges. Many of these badges involve playing a certain amount of quizzes in a subcategory in order to win the badge. I'm currently lobbying for a badge for the kpop subcategory [here](http://www.sporcle.com/groups/badge-ideas/topics/76378e8f8f4d/).

However, this is where I need help. Although the kpop community on the site is large, they are not active in the Sporcle groups, so they will never see my badge idea. On top of that, many of the users who are in the badge suggestion group I linked to above are the kind who are not interested in kpop and immediately dismiss it upon seeing the idea, without even reading the reasons why a badge should be implemented. 

I would love it if this sub could come over to Sporcle and show support. If the admins see that enough people are interested, a kpop badge would be well on its way to becoming a reality, giving the kpop subcategory the kind of PR it needs -- and, hopefully with it, more fans. 

Even if you don't want to support the badge, at least you now know about the kpop subcategory on the site! It's pretty cool and a lot of quizzes are really good (though a lot are also really, really bad). But if you do, please come [here](http://www.sporcle.com/groups/badge-ideas/topics/76378e8f8f4d/) and help me out! I'd really appreciate and I know the kpop community on the site would, too. Thanks, and sorry for the long post -- I hope this is okay!",6,25

Just wondering stuff like how much did you have to spend to get in? Which group was it, what kind of rules were in place, how much time could you talk with them, how were they in general? Did it make you a bigger fan or have a negative impact? Did you change bias? Who did you really love talking to? If you don't speak Korean, did they try to speak to you in English? Etc...

If you don't have any experiences but know of any fanaccounts or stories you enjoyed, pls share it :) I love reading these things and never know where to look. Thanks!

EDIT: Omg thanks for the replies!!! I have a few experiences myself with fx, twice but I haven't written about them anywhere because I don't use social media platforms a lot and don't know where to put them. I will try to write them later and read everything here! :DD",114,91

-


Produce101 is out! Here is a guide on how to vote. It's pretty self explanatory, but meh.

-  Head on over to this website [here](http://mnettv.interest.me/produce101/main.dbp).
- Click on the login button on the top right. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/OMMPxkc.png)
- Login with FaceBook, Twitter or a CJOne account. You cannot vote with a seperate MNet account, probs due to verification. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/iCBnJRL.png)
- Choose your girls by clicking on them. I recommend you vote for the ""terrible singer"", because she isn't terrible at all. You can choose 11 girls. The sorting options on the top are 'Alphabetical Name' and 'Alphabetical Agency'. Here's an [image](http://i.imgur.com/CYf4MhF.png). Out of the 11 girls, I voted for the ""terrible singer"" because I stan her. Her name is .
- Once voting for 11 girls, on the sidebar, there should be a pink button on the bottom of the girls. Click on that.
- You should receive a message saying that you voted. If you receive a popup, you've done something wrong. Comment below and I can help you out.

Have fun voting! Voting period for Produce101 lasts from 22nd January - 13th of February.

1563,2016-1-26,2016,1,26,8,42od9u,Why did some of the top MV submissions vanish? An explanation,schrobby,1453763241,"As the more active users on this subreddit may have noticed, a certain power user, whose name used to show up on the frontpage almost daily, has recently disappeared from this subreddit and with them some of /r/kpop's top MV submissions of all time (including _Daddy_ and _Twenty-three_). Since there is no way for us as moderators to ever reinstate any of these submissions, this means they have robbed this subreddit of some of its most valued content for feeling _""unfairly treated""_ (more about that later). 

When a user removes their reddit account, all their submissions and comments remain visible on the listing pages and searchable. This users however intentionally removed all their most popular submissions before deleting their account in order to spite ... us? Other users? Themselves? We don't know exactly, but we think it has to do with a competition that exists between power users on this subreddit which has recently gotten a little out of hand.

Around the time this subreddit gained a lot more activity more than a year ago, some users realized they could amass a lot of karma easily by being the first one to post a highly anticipated music video. Since the most popular releases tend to come from just a handful of YouTube channels and follow a similar title format, it was trivial for them to switch from manual to scripted posting. Now, karma gained on /r/kpop is __not__ worth more than what you get by reposting shitty memes to /r/AdviceAnimals, but sadly they did not realize that, and left us to deal with them using bots in order to ""win"" out against other users. 

While we quickly realized what was going on, fighting against it with bans and post removals yielded nothing. New accounts would show up, complaints in modmail, etc. However, over the last 4 months or so, things have gotten even worse. With multiple people now using bots to make MV submissions, some of them got clever and extended their bots to mass-report their competitions' posts (which is not allowed by reddit, and we have reported to the admins), thereby getting them removed (there are now additional precautions against this).

We believe that this was what eventually led the user I mentioned in the beginning of this post to feel alienated and remove their account - MV submissions included. While we understand why that might have given them the impression of _""unfair treatment""_ by us, they should keep in mind that none of that was caused by us, and that their actions (botting) are not exactly fair to regular /r/kpop users either.

---

__What do you think?__

The submissions that have been deleted will probably remain deleted. Although we will contact the admins and ask them to reinstate the posts, exceptions like these are very rarely made and we are not very hopeful. 

However, what we can do is try and prevent such behavior in the future. As mentioned before, we have slightly changed the reviewing process for mass-reported submissions (a few of you will have noticed they are now approved submitters of this subreddit). 

In addition to that, we are contemplating on whether to __use an official subreddit bot that would automatically post any new MV release from major channels and delete any other competing submissions__. This way we can guarantee that posts will stay up indefinitely and be posted on time, but obviously this is unfair to you as users and defeats the purpose of reddit. 

So we would like to hear if you have other idea on how to tackle this issue.",200,164

I have at most 3 members per group and, with exception to the jokers, I used a random number generator to decide who goes where else I'd spend forever figuring out who would be king/queen/etc then feeling bad that Eunji, Hyuna, and Hani all can't be queens. :(

#for some reason my comments are hidden

this is a ***CAMBODIAN*** song

to /u/tastetherainbeau

&gt;looks like theres credits on the teaser. cant read cambodian and im having a hard time typing it. looks like each letter is a syllable and the parts that looks like they could be shinshadong tiger bc of length should have choi gyu sungs name too but none of the shorter words i can type sound like choi gyu sung at all

&gt;then again those might not be credits at all bc idk cambodian

to /u/Ekisho

&gt;possible. they made the beat worse tho. why would they do that

When Kahi graduated she had a solo career and has been doing musicals recently. Juyeon had a couple of acting gigs and she can always model, but Jungah has never been involved in the entertainment industry outside After School, she didn't make a name for herself out there, without AS she has  nothing.

1927,2016-1-30,2016,1,30,11,43c8eg,Fan account of f(x)'s first concert Jan 29,ladauphine,1454121127,"So this is probably the only time I will ever fan account for another group besides SHINee, but these girls are my favorite ladies and I was honored to be a part of their very first concert so I will share what I remember.

So initially when I did ticketing for this I had seats (and I got two together in the first rush which is essentially unheard of, I'm still quite proud of that) but a couple weeks ago my weird friend who actually enjoys ticketing and is freakishly good at it got two floor seats and so I took those and sold my other seats. This was a good decision.

I got to the venue in Olympic Park and was quite surprised. It is small. Very small. if you see pics online of this massive purple ocean its photoshopped. It was the smallest venue I've been in for a concert including SHINee's anniversary party. But this was also a good thing, and the smallness didn't make the ocean any less beautiful, just much more intimate.

The floor seats were not actually seats at all, they were proper standing. I was not actually well prepared for this, but it was cool, I was about 10 feet away from the side of the stage the whole night.

Perhaps because it was the night that wasn't in the initial ticketing rush, but it was an oddly mixed crowd. Like their were shit head EXO L's that were woo wooing whenever EXO showed on the screen when the SM Artium video played. It seemed to lack cohesion at first as it seemed that it wasn't mostly f(x) fans as opposed to a mix of those and just people who enjoy their music (this is really unusual for a kpop concert due to how fandom works). 

Finally the lights dimmed. The KLAV screen fell to reveal the stage behind. The opening VCR was as weird and off the wall as expected with the girls walking on a sort of lunar landscape at parts and other bizarre stuff such as green eyed Krystal. It really pumped everyone up with its eerie charm.  The lights lit up each member individually as they removed their own KLAV helmets and they went straight into Electric Shock.

Now I didn't know the fan chants, but I had a Victoria fanboy right behind me the whole night who helpfully knew everything so it was easy to follow him. All the girls started off trying to look serious and sexy except Luna who literally never bothered the entire night. Her face must ache today cause she smiled so big and so constantly the entire night. It was like looking at the freaking sun.

The next song Red Light really got me though. I am a bit of a Krystal bias and so I was watching her a lot. And we all know that she is known for being a bit stoic, and Red Light is a very serious sort of choreography. But there were multiple times during that song that I saw her have to fight to keep the smile off her face. I actually got a bit teary eyed cause she was clearly so happy and so excited and it was fucking beautiful to see. I saw her do this a lot through the night, but it hit me the hardest during this song.

The Dracula choreography and stage was so freaking cool, then there was Krystal biting the backup dancer and them doing the weird hand dance and It was just great. After that came the first talk, Krystal and Victoria ran off to change and so Amber and Luna were entertaining us with mixing English and Korean and getting confused and it was so cute. Luna's aegyo voice and actions had the whole hall in fits. And her hair was so bouncy too, she was just like a happy little girl the whole time. Krystal and Victoria came back out in school girl outfits and the other two went to change.

They did La Cha Ta and other upbeat songs out on the stage, so I was a bit behind them and this wasn't ideal but it paid off multiple times later in the concert. But it meant I didn't see a lot of new choreo clearly. Meh. Then the girls did their two ballads, and Luna looked on the verge of tears throughout ""Sorry (Dear Daddy)"" she was constantly having to deep breathe and compose herself during Krystals parts.

The stage went dark and we had another VCR here I believe and they brought out mic stands. The girls came out walking like little toy robots and did the choreo for Signal and Shadow with these movements at the mic stands. It was really cute then they moved out onto the stage and did Milk and Ice Cream which was SO CUTE. The girls were running around the stage and offering their ice cream cones to fans. I had Victoria about 10 ft away from me the whole time and she kept making eye contact and she was just so fucking happy and. I may have a Victoria bias now. I don't know.

Travellers choreo was really adorable and Krystal looked like a cute snail with her big bag and Amber glommed onto her at one point and a bunch of dancers joined in.Krystal just pouted cutely and they went up on one of the risers in front of me and were making adorable faces at us.

Then they came down and did Airplane. The energy was insane and then the girls went out into the crowd. Because the venue was so small they had to walk by seats to get to the other mini stage on the second level. I got really weepy here too because I was so happy for their fans. Ultimately I am not an f(x) fan, not in the way that I am a SHINee fan, but so many of the people that the girls were walking past and touching their hands WERE their fans, the fans who have waited so long for this. And I was just so happy to be able to see this moment, I could feel their fans joy. It was beautiful to watch.

After doing a few songs out there, the girls walked back to the main stage and performed Rainbow (yuuuuussss) and Pretty Girl which is one of my all time favorites. They were so interactive with the audience to and were pointing out into the crowd so much during Pretty Girl. 

Thankfully they went back to the far back part of the main stage for the next set as I really wanted to see the choreo. They did Rum Pum Pum Pum and the fanchants WERE SO LOUD. The girls were smiling so much. And it was so fun. Step was also insanely high energy and was so cute when Amber fell down before Shake That Brass started up and they all did part of it with her before finishing off Step.

Then they did 4 Walls and it was so cool to see Krystal's bell bottoms up close (I have a huge thing for those pants). There were fireworks that timed so perfectly and just made the shimmery fabric of their shirts shine  and it was really an excellent performance.

Then Papi. Papi was everything I have ever wanted. The energy was nuts, the girls were running around. I got lots of each of them right in front of my section just dancing and smiling and being super awesome.

Deja Vu was great too and the kind of stutter parts of the song, the dance was really cute and Luna always made the silliest sweetest faces.

Rude Love was the best though. Again insane energy and lots of running around and then streamers shooting off and I grabbed one  out of the air and wrapped it around my lightstick.

The Encore they came out around the top again and walked through the crowd one more time but this time they picked up so many little gifts and banners and they were on the stage holding banners for each other. Victoria had a Krystal banner and then dropped it while waving it around. They each had one of their event banners that fans had given them and looked so so happy when they were reading them. 

Finally it was over and they were leaving and Krystal was off first and then Victoria and Luna made a cute pose and Amber ran back and slide onto the floor. The last one to leave was Luna. She was out there alone for a little bit looking and she stomped her feet a bit and made a pouty face before leaving and waving with huge smile on her face. She clearly didn't want it to be over. 

It was a freaking incredible concert. Everything was perfect for them. I came away from it so happy for the girls and for their fans. It was such a special night. I can't wait to hear how the next two nights go as well.",64,283
