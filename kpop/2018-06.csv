&amp;nbsp;

#### Reddit Redesign Update

We've been working hard to get the [redesigned subreddit](http://new.reddit.com/r/kpop) looking good and functioning as well as possible.  We have recently added [custom default thumbnails](https://i.imgur.com/ElxTIab.png) for text posts and posts that fail to grab a thumbnail.  They are still a work-in-progress, but let us know what you think of them.  We have also added extra highlighting for posts flaired as [Meta], [Feature], and [Music Show].  We hope these highlights and icons will help these posts stand out more and get noticed.  We will be very careful not go overboard with this highlighting.  We don't want the sub to turn into a messy rainbow of highlights, so we have no plans to expand this list anytime soon.

The Reddit Admins have recently granted access to the sidebar widget API.  That means we *should* be able to get iChart working on the new sidebar.  It's going to take a bit of time, but it looks possible now.  There is still no word regarding multiple rotating banners, but we remain hopeful.  We're still working on getting everything sorted out.  The rules in the sidebar are not exactly the same as the old site because of stupid reddit reasons, but we're hopeful that we can use the calendar widget to post upcoming releases.

We want to hear how many of you are using the new site on a regular basis and what you think of it.  If your only feedback is *""I hate the redesign""*, please don't bother.  Whether you hate it or not, it's coming and we have no choice in the matter.  All we can do is make the best of it, so please give feedback that helps us do that.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Variety Show ""News""

Quite a few news threads get submitted that can basically be summarized as ""Idol says something mundane on Variety Show"".  Here are some examples of what we mean: [Example 1](https://www.soompi.com/2018/05/31/watch-kang-daniel-mark-bond-surprising-ong-seong-woo-phone/) -- [Example 2](https://www.soompi.com/2018/05/30/watch-shinee-shows-different-personalities-driving-reality-show-preview/) -- [Example 3](https://www.soompi.com/2018/05/14/watch-exos-xiumin-meets-actor-kim-min-suk-speed-skater-kim-min-seok/).  We do not consider these stories newsworthy and will be removing them even if they contain multiple idols or groups.  We would much rather you guys submit a link to the actual variety clip (preferably with subtitles) rather than this type of story about a clip.  Of course, if the idol says something interesting, meaningful, or reveals some new information, that would still be fine to post.  Basically, if the [News] tag doesn't look like it fits, don't submit the article.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Song and Album Reviews

With BTS and other K-Pop groups becoming more popular with mainstream western media, we've seen an increase in song and album reviews by major music publications like Pitchfork, 405, Spin, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Sound Digest, etc., as well as media giants like the BBC, Guardian, NYT, Forbes, and others.  Our policy up until now is that song and album reviews should be posted in the group subreddits.  We recently allowed a link to [Pitchfork's review of BTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8lqrla/pitchfork_reviews_bts_love_yourself_%E8%BD%89_tear/) and it seemed pretty popular.  Do you guys still want song and album reviews to be kept in the group subs or would you like to see a change here?  We don't want to allow every song review from every random blogspot page, but some major sites might have merit.  Drawing that line could be tricky.  Additionally, do we want 5-6 review threads for the same album?  We could allow users to post an ""Album Review Roundup"" thread for each new release, or we could add these links to the existing Album Discussion and 2-Weeks Later threads.  We could also just keep things how they are and remove all song and album reviews, regardless of who publishes them.  Let us know if you want to see more song and album reviews on the subreddit and if so how we can control the quality of them.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Jumping the Gun

In the race for maximum Karma, users have discovered all sorts of tricks to help them submit first.  The worst of these is jumping the gun.  This is when the user posts an empty or incomplete imgur album, then adds the rest of the pictures after submitting, or when the user locates the URL for a video and posts it before the video is live.  Please do not do these things.  It creates a bad experience for users and it breaks some mobile clients and common extensions like Imagus.  Empty or incomplete albums will be removed if spotted by a mod.  Additionally, video submissions timestamped before the MV or teaser's release time will also be removed.  Quality submissions are more important than Karma.  Remember that.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Translations Again

We have talked about translations several times in past Town Halls, but we feel the need to bring it up again.  Please remember that single line Twitter translations like @OH_mes and others are not sufficient translations for our posts.  If the Twitter link contains the full translation of the article (like in an image), then that's fine, but otherwise, we need more than just a line or two.  If you do not speak Korean fluently, please do not post links to Korean articles and attempt to translate them in the comments.  Machine translations like Google, Bing, and Naver are forbidden.  Yes, we can tell.  Instead, please wait for an English language site to translate and post the news, then submit a link to that.  This rule isn't difficult to follow.  If you don't speak Korean, don't submit links to naver or .kr sites.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",177,59

It made me think about how there's been some... conceptually difficulties with one of my favorite groups CLC and how they can't ever seem to make large mainstream strides.          
Overall I was wondering if you all think that an idol or group *needs* a concept or if it just helps create a foundation of fans?                 
(e.g. SNSD starting as a [cutesy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I) [innocent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ) vibe and venturing into many different sounds such as [bad-girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8), [experimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E), [sexy(?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJYGddE0vHc) etc.
Can a group or idol have a ""no-concept concept"" from the debut and still succeed? ([Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qmsJbJasfo) [CLC's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNUP5B_NZUE) [Discography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF6Wds75rjg)).

Merch here in Korea sell out quickly, and something I have learned even from just short trips, is that you have to line up for merch. I got off at Guil station and started walking towards the dome. Banners lead the way along the dome, and I might have a picture with most of the Minhyun ones. At first I was a bit confused since it looked so empty. There were a few people around, but I didnt see the crazy line I expected. Until I got to just after the merch stands. The line continued over the bridge, and I hurried to line up. I ended up next to two super nice Singaporean girls who had flew here for the concert. They were going all days, with standing one day and 4th floor the other two.   
  
It took around five hours from arriving and lining up, until I reached the front and were able to purchase my goods. At this point the line behind us was even longer, so I was happy I got there early. I managed to buy everything I wanted! It included the lightstick, polaroid set, bandaids, and the [Minhyun badge set]( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/200820245563310080/451927679730581525/image.jpg). The fox badge is seriously the cutest.   
  
I went back to rest a bit before the concert started, but returned again around four to find the Minhyun fansite Serenity, since I had pre-ordered a cheering kit. The banner was so nice and the stickers and photocards so cute! I love fansite goods. I went around trying to look at other goods while I waited for doors to open, but there was so many people there! It was a bit difficult to see anything, so I regretted not staying longer during the morning. Meanwhile, the venue started testing the lightsticks. Suddenly all lightsticks turned on and started flashing in alternating colours, and there was no way to turn it off. I ended up unscrewing the battery pack to save the batteries for the concert.  
  
After some time, I noticed people heading towards the doors, and followed them. My ticket was on the first floor, but quite far right. I could easily see everything, but as the venue was huge I was still far from the stage. I cant imagine how small everything must have looked from the 4th floor.  
  
The concert started with a bang, as Burn it up was the first song. Fireworks and hype right away, I cant believe I got to see it live! We all screamed as they Wanna One did the choreo. Once it ended, they disappeared without a word and the MC got on stage. The first concert day, Wanna One were filming for their X-CON show. The MC talked for a bit, introducing the show and Wanna One. With little warning, the unit stages started. First out was Lean On Me and I was not prepared. It was so beautiful, I alternated between slowly waving my lightstick back and forth and hugging it. I cant imagine how excited Minhyun must have been to collab with Nell, hes such a big fan. The song was a really nice ballad, and I can definitely see myself listening to it more when the album is out.  
Minhyun, Jisung, and Sungwoon walked of stage, and Triple Positions Kangaroo was next. Such a happy and up-tempo song! They had beware of kangaroo signs as the digital backdrop, and later added other typical Australian landmarks. They also ran around the stage and looked like they had so much fun! The choreo was lively and a bit silly.  
After those two stages, the MC and Minhyuns group came on stage again, along with Nell and Zico. They showed a VCR of Minhyuns group writing letters to each other. The members stayed on stage, and we could see their live reactions. Sometimes they were really funny! Sungwoon fell to the floor when he watched himself read the letter. Minhyun wrote a really nice letter to Jisung, and Jisung hugged him. For Jisungs letter people laughed again, Sungwoon fell to the floor again, and Jisung fell into Minhyuns lap. Then they talked a bit with Nell. Video two was with Daniels group. It showed first the three of them jamming with Zico in his studio, but later turned it turned into a fried chicken drama, where they were hungry and tried to order fried chicken, but something went wrong and they got way too little food, haha!
After they talked a bit with Zico. It was cute how Daniel and Jaehwan conspired together to hand the mic to a surprised Woojin, so they could run and get water. Daniel and Zico seemed to get along really well as they kept whispering to each other on stage. Daniel also welcomed all the international X-CON viewers in English. I swooned a bit. His pronunciation is quite good now! 
  
Then it was time for the next two stages. First out was Number One with 11, which started with a dance solo from Jinyoung. The song was more dance focused, and in my opinion Dynamic Duos feature felt way too long. But the choreo was really nice. Maybe Ill like the cd version of the song more.  
Ong and Daehwis (The Heal) Hourglass started with Daehwi playing the piano. Then switched to a solo dance from Ong. Then both at once. The song itself was probably my objective favourite. Heizes feature was really nice and felt just long enough for it to still feel like Ongs and Daehwis song.   
I honestly dont remember Jihoons groups video. Ongs and Daehwis video was amazing. It was pretty much them doing all this weird stuff. They went around in a fancy looking carriage pulled by a guy. Then they went and played dress up. Then they went out rowing, with Daehwi having no idea how to row, but somehow ending up with the oars, and Ong not improving the situation by rocking the boat and standing up. It was hilarious! When they all went on stage again, Daehwi was really cute and went up to Heize and was super happy. Ong was weird and I was reminded again that Id never trust him with anything if I met him in real life. He and Daehwi also did some kind of weird pose to explain their name.   
  
It was a bit sad how they kept turning off everyones lightsticks as soon as the songs ended. Maybe it looks better that way in the video, but its not the same to cheer after a song with a lightstick thats turned off... it improved later during the concert.  
  
After unit stages they showed a VCR with behind the scenes of Light MV filming. Lots of screaming for dance scenes and Daniel running scenes, but it looks really good! Im excited! Most of the group choreo looked like it was in an abandoned swimming pool. The members pretended to swim around and play with swimming rings in the empty pool while they waited for all to get there. Dorks. After the VCR, Wanna One came on stage and performed Light. It was great! I like it a lot more than Boomerang!  
Next up was Never. Still so many mixed feelings with this song. But they did it well and the entire audience screamed along at the Never parts. They immediately jumped into Energetic afterwards. Before the concert started, they had us practice the fanchants with lyric videos, so I knew it a bit better than I normally would! The Energetic parts were the loudest. After that we got a VCR about the members being good looking. I think it was in this one Minhyun was driving a car and looking badass. Everyone screamed. We then see two people coming on stage. A dance break! Jihoon and Woojin had a collab. The return of pink sausages duo!  
  
The rest of the group rose up from behind to join Jihoon and Woojing, as Boomerang started. Seeing it like made me enjoy the Wing Wing Wing part more, it was fun to fanchant! And there was so much fireworks!  
We got a ment, and then, wow, Day by Day. I did not expect it. The choreo... once the song ended all the people around me turned to their friends and pretty much screamed at each other. It was an experience. In hindsight it feels a bit weird that they had the minor members do that choreo as well.  
The members had spread out along the extended stage for Day by Day, but headed back to the main stage for Beautiful. In Beautiful, I loved the rain effect. They made it so pretty. There was added effects to the video, which did make it a bit more difficult to see, but also so pretty! Beautiful ended with a Daniel dance solo, and they added a smoke effect on the video, which followed his movements. It looked magical.  
  
I think we got another VCR with the remaining members looking cool here, including a really cool shot of Sungwoon turning into Ong. People around me gasped.  
Then, wow Jaehwan. I know he can sing, but theres something extra about seeing it live. He had a solo intro of Ill Remember, which was so beautiful. Then the other members joined in to sing the full song.  
Wanna was after and was so nice. They walked out to the outer stage, and it started rotating. Then they rose it up, so the members were on a rotating platform while singing. Jaehwan gestured got us to wave our lightsticks more, so we did. Then it went even more emo with Always. That song makes me sad, the only one worse is piano Nayana.  
  
We got a ment, and then this amazing VCR. It was subbed, yay! So I could understand! We got to follow the three doctors Daehwi, doctor of love who loves everything, Sungwoon, doctor of (curiosity/experimenting?) who did a bunch of crazy experiments, and Woojin, doctor of passion who is passionate about everything he does. They were all dressed up funny and kept playing in this spaceship. Then oh no! They pressed a button and hologram Minhyun appears to tell them to find the tool to set them free, which is a button on the space ship. After pressing various buttons such as muting themselves and turning on audience cams, they find the scream button. And now we need to help with screaming to reach 100 and they win! Really cute video. When we succeeded with the screaming and the VCR ended, the lights turned to a DJ stand, and DJ One Meal (Jisung) entered! Our lightsticks kept blinking and changing colours like a club, along with all the other light effects! We got first a bit of solo DJing, then Sungwoon entered for a dance break. I didnt see clearly because it was quite far from me. Then the song changed and Guanlin appeared for a dance solo! He was quite close to where I was sitting, so I could see quite well. He has really improved so much the past year!  
  
The rest of the group appeared on stage with selfie sticks, and a super cute Wanna Be (My Baby) started. I tried to do the fanchants, since they had us practice them before the concert, but I got distracted since it was for this song all of them walked the closest to where I was sitting, along this extended stage that they just passed by for the other songs. I think all of them except Minhyun walked out there during the song. I should have gotten a seat on the other side of the stadium!   
Wanna Be moved over into Twilight, and our lightsticks were set to all twinkle in different colours, so cute. Then we got a ment about the golden era of Wanna One, which led into them performing Gold. Everyone sang along.   
Wanna One went off stage and we started chanting Encore! Encore!. That then turned into Wanna One! Wanna One! and a VCR finally started. Once it ended, Wanna One returned to stage and performed Pick Me. Oh the flashbacks. They ran out on the extended stage during the performance, and this time Minhyun stopped by my extended stage! They had to hurry back for a last ment and asked us if they had missed anything. People were screaming for IPU, which was what they wanted, so as a last goodbye song Wanna One performed IPU. I love how fun that song is! Once they finished, they waved goodbye and disappeared. And it was over. Such a great concert. 
Then I ran to the metro to get there before most other people.  
  
I heard the setlist changed a bit the second day, with all members having solo stages. And I have seen pics of Minhyun shirtless everywhere on twitter. I knew I should have gotten another ticket!

If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can review the MV for it as well but thats optional, up to you!

An example would be Elkies [kiss](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8O6IknNLo) and Yeeuns [neodo nal wonhajanha](https://youtu.be/u9OxRFab6o4).

A more popular example would be Sanas [shy shy shy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nQb2hJGsdZc) and Momos [joreujima eolma gaji ana bureuge haejulkke Baby](https://youtu.be/jNxDpC5t938). These were not the original killing parts, just ones that were loved by the public.

Everyone know BTS are international stars. I know they are it for a long time now, but I realized it today while looking up the concert prices for the Love Yourself world tour today.

The first time I went to a BTS concert it was on the KCON in Paris 2016 and it was awesome. The prices where a lot cheaper back then why I realized it just today, although I wish the guys the best I am sad not to be able to afford a good seat.

I know a lot of you get this and I feel you, too.

So in all my love and dedication to BTS, I decided to do a BTS airport fashion outfit today. Suga wore the outfit in the 23rd May 2018 on the trip back to Incheon after the BBMAs 2018.

*Processing img 43l4xiyrwq111...*

I chose this outfit because it looks really elegant and comfy at the same time. I like how Suga always looks awesome with a minimalistic outfit. Even if I like detailed outfits I sometimes like to wear uncomplicated fashion without frills. Especially on normal days or on trips.

This time I think I really nailed the outfit with my picks!

*Processing img i2kgzqbtwq111...*

So originally this is a blogpost from my blog [https://www.fashionchingu.com/outfit\-ideas/k\-pop\-outfits/bts\-airport\-fashion\-may\-2018\-suga/](https://www.fashionchingu.com/outfit-ideas/k-pop-outfits/bts-airport-fashion-may-2018-suga/)

That comes on when the group's name is mentioned on some variety or talk show during the little clip quickly highlighting which group it is. The song that might appear in a noraebang scene or a group cover on a kdrama.

Also why? Sometimes it's not their most successful song or the first breakout hit. What's the context for it being seen as the song one thinks for general people when they hear X group.

For my bias group it was usually Bang! Before anyone says it should be BOY, my take is for the above criteria, it's actually Bang! It's their most successful song that showcased their general powerful, maturer concepts. Pledis artists almost always cover this song, not only them but only other shows as well.",1,1

224,2018-6-4,2018,6,4,1,8o9rai,[Fan Account] 180603 LOONA Line&amp;Up Premiere Greeting Event,kikistiel,1528043902,"So I was able to snag a ticket to the Line&amp;Up LOONA Premier Greeting event, and I wanted to share with fellow Loonatics the OT12 goodness!!! I was so excited to see these girls up close and WOW are they all gorgeous. Just.  Wow. 

[PROOF](https://m.imgur.com/a/whinznN)

Unfortunately I was only able to get a picture of the venue before it started because there was a strict no photography policy for the event. After watching some people get removed for taking pictures, I decided not to risk it and kept my phone put away. I was in the 5th row, soooo close!!! This event sold out in 2 minutes, Im so proud of my girls!!

I apologize in advance for any mistakes, and if Im leaving out details or forgetting things. Its been a long night. So, here we go:

I picked up my ticket at 11am, got some merch (it all sold out pretty quickly) and went home to get ready. Came back, and the event started around 6. There were some fansites handing out signs. As we entered the venue, we were handed signs to hold up for Choerrys birthday! They had prepared a cake for her for the end. We were asked not to show Choerry the sign until it was time to sing Happy Birthday. 

We got to our seats, and we were sooooo close. Having been used to western pop artists in huge arenas and BTS concerts, I was amazed at being so close. We were 5th row. The venue was fairly large, a bottom seating area and a balcony seating area. We were told there was to be zero photography, so I couldnt get any photos. Youll all have to see the girls beauty for yourselves :( 

The event started right on time at 6pm, and my heart and soul JinSoul and Odd Eye Circle were up first. There was a little intro video of Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry, and they opened with Sweet Crazy Love. When the doors opened and revealed OEC in their colored uniforms and JinSoul in that eye patch... well. Im not ashamed to say I screamed a tiny bit. (Maybe a lot, holla at those fancams that most definitely caught it)

OEC are absolutely incredible performers. Kim Lip is. A. Bombshell. She has a natural allure to her on stage that I cant quite put a name to. Shes got a beautiful voice, and her dancing is so fluid and beautiful. Choerry oozes the perfect balance of cute and badass in her performing. KimLip and Choerry are gorgeous in person. A lot of this fan account is going to be me talking about how beautiful they all are, but LOONA truly has a group full of visuals. 

AND JINSOUL. I couldnt peel my eyes away from her. I know, I know. Shes my bias, so it makes sense. But JinSoul onstage vs off stage are two totally different people. On stage shes fierce as hell. Her dancing is sharp and on point. There was one part where she was swinging her hips and I thought she would knock someone out with them. Her voice is beautiful, too. 

After Sweet Crazy Love, they performed Girl Front. Girl Front was absolutely my summer jam last year, and seeing it done live was so powerful. 

After the songs, the girls sat down to talk and interact for a bit. Yves came out and MCd! They talked about themselves a bit, they were asked to act cute. Choerry and KimLip did something adorable, and JinSoul talked like a gremlin. Thats my girl. Then, they played a game. The game was to flick a bottle cap on to a color wheel. Choerry won, she immediately got the cap on her color (purple) first try. KimLip did alright, she made some progress on it. JinSoul did... her best...

During their talking, JinSoul was constantly having little silent conversations with the fans in the audience, giving out Hearts, etc. Shes a master of fan service. After the game, they performed their last song and it was time for 1/3!

1/3 had a little intro video as well, and then they performed Love &amp; Live!! OECs concept is very girl crush, so seeing 1/3 right after was an interesting juxtaposition. Ive always enjoyed Love &amp; Lives choreography and Haseuls vocals are amazing. I mean... downright incredible. After their performance when they stopped to talk and introduce and play (KIMLIP IN AN ALL RED TUX HYBRID AS MC, WOW) , Haseul sang an old, opera-esque(?) song, and it was BEAUTIFUL. Shes got quite a voice! Its still weird seeing ViVi with not-pink hair, ViVi was when I first started really noticing LOONA so her pink hair and little ponytail are iconic to me. No, all of 1/3 had brown hair tonight. Their vibe very much reminded me of Gfriend, but with their own LOONA flair. The whole time I was wondering  how are 1/3, OEC, and yyxy going to mesh together on stage as OT12?

Hyunjin is apparently blessed with ping pong balls. She bounced a ball on a paddle for an insane distance and amount of time. Hyunjin became my spirit sister today during her intro. She said, I love bread. I eat a lot of bread. Therefor, I became the bread. Then, someone pointed out her larger than average hands. She compared them to ViVis and dwarfed them. She said, the advantage of having big hands is that I can hold more food. The disadvantage... well. There is no disadvantage.

1/3s turn to play a game! Their first activity was guess that dance. Haseul was shown flashcards of famous Kpop dances to do, and the members had to guess which dance it was. Among the dances were Winners Really Really, BTS DNA, Momoland Bboom Bboom, OEC Girl Front, EXID DDD, Psy New Face, and more. The members guess all correctly. 

Next they had to read tongue twisters really fast, all four members had to finish in 60 seconds. Heejin had the hardest one. I feel like this activity was a little stacked against poor ViVi, as Korean is not her native language, haha. She went last and even though she struggled she did very good! They won with 3 seconds left on the clock! They ended with performing Sonatine. 

After 1/3 I was SO SURPRISED FOR YEOJIN TO COME ON! When her intro video played, everyone screamed and got super excited. We all knew shed be there, surely, but its been so long with her doing her own things and such, that we were all so anxious to watch her perform! 

She is SO TINY. But wow she packs a punch. Her vocals live are amazing. She really portrays that cute, aegyo maknae role really well, but she also showed her sassy side during her intro! She said she watched 1/3 try to do aegyo and said it was pretty bad. So, she did her own aegyo (SO CUTE) and said this is how its done, eonnies! Her part was the shortest, but she was so cute and a force to be reckoned with. 

After Yeojin, Heejin perFORMED VIVID GUYS. Im actually a little miffed because when she started doing ViViD I thought that meant all the girls were going to do their solos and I was not prepared for Singing in the Rain, Heart Attack, or Eclipse. Sadly, only Yeojin and Heejin performed their solos. However, vivid is one of my favorite solo tracks, and Heejin did NOT disappoint. Wow, her performance is amazing and hard-hitting! Shes quite a fantastic an on point dancer, the choreography is really eye appealing, and her vocals live are powerful. The theme of the performance was a magic show, with playing cards and such. It was so cute!

Immediately after Heejin was yyxy! They performed Frozen and wow, what a subunit. Visuals EVERYWHERE. They performed in those Clueless-esque yellow uniforms. Gowon... Gowon gowon gowon! She was a bombshell tonight! She looked like she could be KimLips younger sister. Shes stunning. Speaking of stunners, holy crap. Olivia Hye. Shes breathtaking. I always thought that she and Twice Mina look like they could be sisters, and I wonder if Im the only one? Seeing her live just reinforced it for me. Hye is probably the top visual for me in all of LOONA.

Yves... danced to Havana. I still havent recovered. Get it Yves. 

The members said Olivias nickname was Marceline, because they think she is similar to Marceline from Adventure Time! They showed a picture of her playing a guitar and copying a pose of Marcelines. Pretty uncanny, I gotta say. 

yyxy did their game next! Their game was to draw fruit. The fruit drawings would be given away to the audience by drawing tickets afterwards. Yves said she would be an Apple... of course. Gowon was a pineapple. Chuu was a strawberry! And Olivia... well. To be honest Im still not entirely sure what Olivia was. She made a joke about pizza and then it wasnt pizza. When she revealed the drawing......... Im still not sure what it was. It was beautiful but... hmm. Alright, Hye. 

They performed Love4Eva, and I strongly preferred L4E to Frozen as it was, and the dance break was so fulfilling. yyxy is like the perfect center balance between OEC and 1/3. 

After L4E, the stage went dark. Everyone shouted encore, encore! for quite a while, before the loona logo reappeared on the stage. It started pulsing in tandem with our chanting, and finally it went dark. It was silent and we could see movement on stage. Was this it? Were we finally going to see OT12?

The music started, the lights came up, and there they were. All 12 of them. It wasnt just subunits with subunits, either. They were all mixed in with each other. I screamed. I think everyone else screamed, too. It was so surreal, after nearly two years of these girls being kept strictly segregated in releases, after eons wondering and wondering how they would mesh and interact on stage... here they finally were. OT12. 

And they looked STUNNING. They were all dressed in simple black shirts and shorts. We werent sure if they were going to perform a song or just dance, but in the end a dance break made most sense. You can find sneaky fancams of the dance break/performance they did all over social media, but it was a hard hitting, hip hop-ish choreo. Ill admit, watching Yeojin and all of 1/3, who have been marketed very innocently, and also all the underage members, dancing to this choreography, it was a little weird for me. It gave me flashbacks to watching Sixteen and Natty dancing to 7/11 by Beyonc in the first episode. 

Regardless of where you stand on the members dancing like that, they were all amazing. One thing you cant say about LOONA is that they are lacking in the dance talent area. All of the members really are aware of their movements and know how to utilize their bodies while performing. 

I cant even really recount the dance break because not only was it short and GOOD, it was also THE FIRST OT12!!! I was flabbergasted, I knew I should have expected it but I was still in shock. Here they were, all 12, together! As a casual fan since Heejin, and a hardcore loonatic since JinSoul, seeing them all pose together at the end was like realizing a dream come true. We watched them pour so much hard work in to this project, some of the older members having to wait 2 years after their releases for this moment. Its incredibly heart warming and I honestly felt like a proud parent. 

After the dance break, the members were taking a bit to the audience, and the members all mentioned to Choerry that it was her birthday! She got shy and said thank you, at which point they started rolling out the cake they had prepared for her. That was the audiences cue to take out our birthday banners wed been given at the entrance and hold them up. 

As soon as Choerry saw all of the banners, she started to tear up. She thanked all of us, and we sang happy birthday to her. 


INDIVIDUAL CLOSING MENTS:

After the birthday celebrations, it was time for the members ending ments. It was hard for me to keep up with them all because my Korean isnt perfect and a lot of them were mumbling through tears (aww) but heres what I remember the most:

-ViVi said she was incredibly thankful for accepting(?) her and LOONA. She loves everyone more than she can say. 

-Yves... Yves teared up so hard. When she cried, I teared up a lot, too. She was so emotional and heartfelt in her ment. She had a lot to say. She said she reads every letter. She said we are all precious to her and she hopes we can stay together. 

-Gowon said the slogans fans had given them were pretty and she was proud of them. She said she was too brave to cry, but she cried anyways. 

-Yeojin, who was the one shouting  !  ! (Do not cry! Do not cry!) and gave out tissues when all the other members teared up, also teared up a bit herself! She said please watch your health and if we could support loona until the very end she would be grateful. 

-Chuu: She said if we will always love loona, she will as well. She said they will work very hard from here on out. 

-Choerry talked about the fanmeeting, talked about being touched by our support. She said to be safe and everyone worked very hard. 

-Haseul said she was trying so hard not to cry, but she ended up crying a lot. She was barely able to get through her speech. She was so grateful when she looked out in to the audience. She thanked us for coming today, and said she was going to work extra hard to improve herself. 

-Olivia: Said she cried yesterday so she wont cry today. Barely got a few seconds in and became inconsolable with crying. She asked us to please support yyxys promotions and LOONA. 

-Jinsouls was the one I actually cried at. Maybe its because JinSoul is my bias... maybe its because JinSoul definitely portrays herself as the tough member who doesnt cry in front of the others, but she started off strong and playful and as she continued her voice got more and more shaken and ragged as she fought back tears. During the others ments, JinSoul comforted and played with Yves a lot. It seems they are quite close. When JinSoul started crying, Yves broke down again, too.  Jinsoul said that when OEC were promoting, 1/3 told them they felt strange because they missed them (their schedules were too different to see each other often). She said at the time, she didnt understand it. But now that yyxy are preparing for promotions, JinSoul said she now understands how 1/3 felt. She said, she eagerly awaits the day that they can be 12 together, and not missing each other dearly. She said LOONA are like family to her. (Real talk, guys, I cried. A lot.)

Jinsouls ment made me realize that even though we havent seen OT12 interacting on stage or in media, that they have actually bonded a lot behind closed doors. Jinsoul and Yves were very loving to each other during the event, like old friends. Yeojin took on the role of cheering everyone up. Choerry and Hye were very close as well. Heejin provided a lot of comfort to her members. I realized that the girls have spent 2+ years befriending each other and bonding... even if we havent seen it. This wasnt their first time meeting. They have been like family for a long time. And now theyre ready to debut and face the challenges ahead together. 

KimLip said LOONA will debut in August. 

After their ments concluded, they all said their goodbyes, we took a picture as OT12 and the audience, and they walked off stage to an eruption of cheers and applause. 

I left the venue in a daze. The event was amazing, the performances were a blast, GIRL FRONT YALL. Everything was planned and coordinated so perfectly. One of the reasons I adore LOONA so much is because I really love the aesthetic of their whole concept, both individual and as subunits. Im really interested in what their OT12 concept will be. 

Also, as a side note, I have to interrupt my totally professional and serious fan account to mention as an aside: I REALLY LOVE JINSOUL. SHE IS SO SWEET AND SASSY AND HILARIOUS OFF STAGE AND FIERCE ON STAGE. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. Thats all. Its almost 1:45am here in Seoul and Im exhausted so I need to sleep! 

I survived OT12. Barely. I am so ready for LOONA.

To me this sample sounds like a child saying something but I don't know what language it is in.

I was wondering if this sample is kind of like a signature used by the producer to show that it was their beat used in these songs or maybe it's just a common audio byte from a very general source.

Does anyone know where this sample comes from or maybe what producer it is associated with? How are these songs affiliated if at all and what does the use of the sampled sound indicate? Any input is appreciated!",5,1

People talking about ""kids these days don't know how lucky they have it"" compared to the ""you had Youtube/Facebook/MySpace back in the day, what is your excuse for not fully supporting your faces?"" and it is starting to blow up with prominent bloggers/vloggers and key social media people getting involved in the intensifying debate.

I would like to know what everyone's take on the situation and how they personally feel. When did you get into Kpop? If it was a while ago, do you feel the younger ones don't realise how good they have it? If it was recently, do you think the older fans are over-exaggerating?

total cringefest?  

&gt; Why do the women promoting alternative masculinity for Asian men happen to be Asian women? Why do these same Asian women  
&gt;  
&gt;1. **avoid Asian men**  
2. **only tell Asian men** to embrace alternative masculinity  
3. have only non\-Asian partners \(who often also hate Asian men\)  
4. **only pursue men with traditional masculinity**  
5. [have a fetish for and/or are influenced by yaoi](https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL55_0607.pdf)  
6. or, identify as asexual or a lesbian?

This is uh...

And ""Flower boy"" was pushed by the U.S. government?

&gt;The takeaway here is that Kitagawa was a Japanese\-American who had worked for the United States government. Yoshiki also noted that in fact, **it was America** that gave birth to the Johnnies, because Kitagawas first contact with young Japanese boys was at a site owned and operated by the United States government; Washington Heights.Not only is this fact essential to proving that the birth of the flower boy was not something that naturally came from Asian culture, but that there could potentially be something or someone insidious, perhaps even sinister, who was behind the popularization of the flower boy in Asian media. This is especially the case when taking into account the fact that the United States government was involved. As a result, the question\* isn\*t whether the U.S. government played a role in pushing the emasculating style onto young Asian men. Rather, the question tha\*t shoul\*d be asked is how big of a role did it play in pushing the style and how big of a role did it play in potentially brainwashing many young Asian men and women to embrace the style as attractive?

Anyone know if this is true or not?

I'm not South Korean so I don't know the cultural stereotypes surrounding different cities in South Korea like I do with American cities. How are different cities viewed typically and how does it affect how an idol is seen in the industry \(because birthplace does have an impact\)? This will probably be limited because I imagine most idols are from populous cities with higher education for performing arts.

This is based off a few BTS clips I was watching where emphasis was put on Suga and V being from Daegu and Jimin and Jungkook being from Busan. Feel free to talk about specific idols, or if you want to get really fancy, foreign idols and what their birthplaces mean.",61,93

I am relatively new to korean pop music, came across Twice maybe a year ago and now really care about them (Chaeyoung especially ). 
But I remembered reading an article a while back about rampant sexual abuse in the Korean music industry and in music schools where girls are called ""trainees,"" and I got really worried that maybe twice and other groups have been abused. I genuinely care about them, and it would make me really sad if they were hurt in the past but were too scared to come out and talk about it. 

Does anyone know anything about this? Is it in the news? Is anyone in Korea worried or looking into this possibility? 

I am sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, or of it's been asked before. It is a pretty serious topic and goes against the usual happy cheerfulness of kpop. Please tell me where I should ask this question. I just can't keep it in anymore.

319,2018-6-5,2018,6,5,10,8omyp2,Has there been a #metoo movement in K-pop?,AIthough,1528163227,"(Reposted due to a rule violation)

I am relatively new to korean pop music, came across Twice maybe a year ago and now really care about them (Chaeyoung especially ). 
But I remembered reading an article a while back about rampant sexual abuse in the Korean music industry and in music schools where girls are called ""trainees,"" and I got really worried that maybe twice and other groups have been abused. I genuinely care about them, and it would make me really sad if they or members of other groups were hurt in the past but were too scared to come out and talk about it. 


Does anyone know anything about this? Is it in the news? Is anyone in Korea worried or looking into this possibility? 


I am sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, or of it's been asked before. It is a pretty serious topic and goes against the usual happy cheerfulness of kpop. Please tell me where I should ask this question. I just can't keep it in anymore.

Thanks for reading.",11,0

I still like it, but I just am far more detached. And I've been wondering why that is.

I got into Kpop in 2007 and when it really exploded, you know the golden era, everything just felt so new and exciting. I admit it's also because I knew so little of the seediness behind the scenes. But I felt like, around 2009\-2011 there was so much experimentation and though the Kpop world had exploded, it was very niche and tight nit. Like lots of people didn't know about it.

I also loved old variety programs that had lots of idols that really could do well in variety. And lots of male\-female interactions, company interactions, cross\-company interactions. Everything just felt so exciting. I imagine that's how people feel now for those just getting into Kpop.

But maybe I've just been in too long but nothing really feels exciting or new anymore and everything is so much more insular in terms of fandoms and groups. I will say that the last time I had fun with Kpop was when people really thought outside the box namely Produce 101. But overall idk. It's just hard to really get into groups now when I feel like they are so similar to older groups \(sometimes within the same company\). Or when things get a bit too glossy and Western.

How about you?",223,98

It was a bit surprising to read recently that digital downloads by I\-Fans do not directly help a group or idol's popularity. This is somewhat disheartening as I often find that I genuinely enjoy and support many 2nd or 3rd tier by buying their music online and that support counts for nothing.

What can I\-Fans do to ""tip the scales"" and generate the support and enthusiasm needed to propel some of these lower tiered groups to success?",33,45

Let's first publish the meaning of Root Sixteen before revealing the Root Sixteen Members!

1. Root Sixteen

If you have a root 16 in mathematics, you'll get 4! 

Four members represent the willingness to show a variety of colors in four colors of four people 

2. Route Sixteen  
I thought 16 years old was the age of growing into a mature image while feeling pure and fresh! It means being a girl group, both pure and fresh and mature.

Also, if your faves most viewed video is actually something that isn't an MV like a live performance or a variety show or something, add that in too  
  
I'll start with 2PM.  Their most viewed is [Hands Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgrB2KBZws4) from way back in the before time of 2011.  I definitely think it's their most viewed because it's probably one of the best examples of a party song in kpop.  I can't think of anything else being their #1 song.  I mean, it is ridiculously catchy, like if Ring Ding Dong didn't exist, I think this would be like the bg equivalent of Gee.  Speaking of which  
  
Shinee's most viewed is as it turns out [Ring Ding Dong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roughtzsCDI).  However it wasn't always, in fact Lucifer was the most viewed at one point but I guess the whole ""worst song to listen to while taking exams"" thing has pushed it over.  I honestly like Lucifer a lot more and kind of wish it stayed at the top tbh  
  
NCT's most viewed is [The 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA), otherwise known as the greatest debut song of our generation.  I strongly think this is still their best title track I think this is the most appealing to international fans as well.  I can't see any other being their most viewed at the moment.  That song still gets a lot of traction from new fans  
  
Now the reason I have that extra part about non MVs at the beginning is because of Wonder Girls.  Their most viewed MV is Nobody, specifically the English version but their most viewed video is actually [this live performance of Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjP-OJ7Bh4) and up until recently was the most viewed kpop live performance of all time.  I think that brief America push is probably why it got the views it did since I can't think of any other reason.  Anyway it's a great song so I'm not complaining

I'm going to define an essential album as one which fulfills one of more of the following qualifications. The album

1. pushed the boundaries of the genre musically or conceptually and marks a landmark shift in the industry
2. had lasting impact on idol groups in the future
3. was extremely popular and is today well-known and often discussed among fans or
4. in your opinion is the ""crown jewel"" of the genre, every song is a bop

How does the album you pick fulfill one of these requirements?
***
The first record that comes to mind for me is Big Bang's MADE series. By having the group promote every song on the album for 4 months and consistently topping charts with every new release this is one of the most successful album cycles for any kpop group ever. There are very few albums out there that even the general public would possibly know every song off of, and of course we still see idol groups covering Bang Bang Bang or If You on music shows or karaoke rooms today. YG also shifted their release strategy after the success of this album. While it worked for some groups (iKon releasing multiple music videos and promoting several songs off their debut record) these days the two song release thing that YG has been playing at has frustrated fans. But regardless the MADE experience is probably essential for any new fan.",87,126

Im pretty bummed that I missed the auditions held this year but it was during finals/graduation week and I dont live in any of the places where the auditions were held. 

I was thinking about it heavily. Searching the web about my chances of getting in, experience during the audition/training, SM/JYP/YG etc. Im pretty bummed about it since Im pretty old to be a trainee; Im 17 right now turning 18 on stitch day (626).

 I am really interested in SM right now, I LOVE to sing; Ive been self practicing for 11+ years, anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. I dont dance but I would say that its average. I dont know what to say about my looks honestly but Ill try to post a picture of myself in the comments. 

Im starting university right after summer and I think I could afford to study abroad to Korea for a a term and maybe Ill audition there? Probably not a good idea lol. I live in Hawaii btw.

Soo should I do it just for the luls like Rose or should I not do it? I know what am I getting myself into and the consequences the come along with it. But Im at a point where I shouldnt be saying I want to do it but I wont and tell myself that I want to do it so I will do it.

 Honestly Im not looking forward to adulthood lmao.

Aye lmao, this is one of the members of the BBC International Gang. There has already been a fan account of the event that went into quite a bit of details of the event. I wanted to do one too but the other one got posted way quicker, so I'll just post the pictures I got of the event, talk a little bit about the event, and answer any questions in the comments. 

Also I wanted to say thanks to all the international fans that attended the event and supported our group. The international fans that met up from discord/reddit/twitter truly made the event worth it for me (don't get me wrong, the show was amazing). 

|

**DAY 1**

My day 1 seat was pretty bad and I could not see much due to a tall girl that say sitting in front of me lmao. Basically watched most of it from the monitor on the sides of the stage.

|

**DAY 2**

Day 2 was amazing, [second floor seating and in the front on the side.](https://imgur.com/GbNGiKx) There were actually quite a bit of seats that were empty in our section, which I didn't mind so my ears did not get blown out by the fangirl screams like in day 1. There was no one sitting in the seats to my right and my friend was sitting next to me of my left. We were basically the very end of our section but [the view was still great](https://imgur.com/a7GuQXx). Many times while a member was speaking during the mini-games/profile showing, the other members on stage would wave and show gestures to fans. Us being at the very end of our section became such a blessing, many times when they looked up at our section me and my friend would wave frantically to get their attention. It worked. HyunJin was the member that looked up at the second floor the most, she waved at us twice during the event. My friend made the giant heart gesture at her and she did it back. I was shook. Also during the YYXY subunit minigame, Chuu waved at us and did a telescope hand gesture at us. I'm assuming what she was trying to say was that she can see us even though we are all the way in the corner. I was shook again.

**Performances**

I won't go too much into detail since the other post has described the performances really well. I'm also not sure how to describe it other than amazing. The OT12 dance break we got to see during the show, literally had me stone cold. I had goosebumps once the light turned on and you could see all 12 members on stage. The fancams don't do it enough justice but they are the closest thing fans that didn't get to go will get. Also I wouldn't complain about the quality of any fancams as there were tons of staff watching for people who were recording/taking pictures. There were many times you could see people getting dragged away after being caught recording, they returned a few minutes later so I assume they just made them delete the photos/videos. After the girl 3 seats away from us got caught, I decided not to take any photos/video during the performances. So unfortunately I do not have any media coverage to share.

 That dance with the hershey hats. I'm howling.

 This is so goddam weird.

 What's the fandom name and who is the girl with the short carrot hair.

I  heard a girl like me and the boots before and it was alright but not  quite amazing. However I've noticed they have this unexpected unique fresh sound in their music and Chococo had it too.

&gt;Midnight Circus (Riddle me) Oh My (x2)   
&gt;  
&gt;My future is pitch black  
&gt;  
&gt;Just like a puppet on strings  
&gt;  
&gt;This place has me trapped  
&gt;  
&gt;Like Dracula, Dracula   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Grinding and running (Midnight Circus)  
&gt;  
&gt;Precarious rollercoaster (Midnight Circus)

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Itll be over if you look down (Creepy night)  
&gt;  
&gt;If you see the end, you lose (Troubled night)  
&gt;  
&gt;The moment you lose, youre out  
&gt;  
&gt;Show must go on, never stop  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When I cry you laugh  
&gt;  
&gt;In that ironic way  
&gt;  
&gt;The lies of wanting to receive love, ""I am happy"" Replay Replay  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;Like a tragedy in a comedy, like a play with no stage  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Racing towards the light (Midnight Circus)  
&gt;  
&gt;People are like a swarm of butterflies (Midnight Circus)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you comfort me, my heart grows weak (Dont rely)  
&gt;  
&gt;If I get weak, its your responsibility (Dont deny)  
&gt;  
&gt;If you cant take responsibility, then just enjoy   
&gt;  
&gt;Show must go on, never dream  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Three, fall\~ (Here comes the highlight of the show)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And no one was here, in this lit up place  
&gt;  
&gt;On top of the empty stage it turns out I was crying and laughing alone  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I had no place to go after the show was over   
&gt;  
&gt;In the glamorous lights   
&gt;  
&gt;The place to get tricked under the splendid light   
&gt;  
&gt;Were in the midnight, midnight circus show

i was planning on ordering from kpopmart, as their prices are fairly low on the albums themselves. obviously the problem there is that it'll take three weeks to get here, so I'm doubtful I'll be able to get them by my birthday.

After a checkup from the military hospital, it was concluded that a nerve in the right side of his chin has become paralyzed.


Back in April before his military enlistment, Jun.K received surgery in an area of his face at a hospital in Gangnam. However, it is difficult to determine whether or not the symptoms in Jun.K's chin are from the aftereffects of surgery, or from an additional injury during his training.


JYP Entertainmentstated,""It's something that happened inside the army, so it is difficult for even us to check.""


Currently, Jun.K is unable to return to the Gangnam hospital to receive recovery treatment; as a result, he plans on continuing his basic training while receiving aid from the military hospital.""

And they all seemingly appeal to three different audiences. I thought it would be interesting to see what everyone's favorite version was.

China's version, IMO was actually really good. You could argue it's a better ""song"" song than the original Korean one, but it might lack the hype and I guess meme-ness of the original. I haven't listened to the Produce48 one much, but it seems like it's going for the higher pitched, cuteness that Japanese audiences might like more. ",13,15

Not many people will think of Shinee as the king of Kpop. Compounding the matter, they've only won 1 Daesang in their 10 years career (I might be wrong on that one). What might be the problem that prevents them from reaching the very top of Kpop? They have talents, looks, company power, and so on. I just don't get it.",7,3

Thank you to everyone who participated in the thread.  Thanks to your feedback, we'd like to announce a few changes and decisions that resulted from it.

#### Song and Album Reviews

The most popular feedback seemed split between placing reviews inside the existing ""album discussion"" and ""2-weeks later"" threads, and allowing a Review Roundup post.  We feel both are good ideas and will allow both moving forward.  If you're creating an album discussion thread or a ""2-weeks later"" thread, you are encouraged to include links to song and album reviews in these threads.  It makes sense to talk about those reviews within the context of the album discussion threads.  You may also post a separate review roundup thread for any single or album release.  Review roundup threads should be text posts and include links to any relevant reviews for the song.  They can be from any media source including YouTube video reviews.  Thread titles should be formatted `Artist - Title (Review Roundup)`.  You may also highlight review sources in the title if you wish for example, `Artist - Title (Review Roundup) - Pitchfork, Spin, Billboard, +more`.  Please note, that one or two reviews is not a roundup, so please have at least three reviews ready to link.  Additional reviews that are published later or found by other users will be directed to the comments of the Roundup post if one exists.  Let us know how you feel about this change in the comments below.

#### YouTube View Posts

Alright, we hear you.  You guys have been complaining about MV View posts for a while now, so we're going to make a change.  Starting today YouTube MV views posts will only be allowed for the **first video by an artist to pass each 100M milestone**.  For example, when DNA by BTS reaches 400M, a post will be allowed because it will be the first BTS MV to reach 400M.  However, no other BTS songs will be permitted to be be posted when they reach 400M since DNA already surpassed it.  New BTS songs that pass 100M, 200M or 300M will also not be permitted since the group passed these milestones long ago.  This will still allow us to celebrate the accomplishments of our favorite groups whether they are passing 100M for the first time or 500M for the first time, but this will eliminate the predictable posts of top groups passing the smaller milestones with every release.  We will still allow posts when an MV breaks major newsworthy records like ""Most Views in 24h"" or ""Most Views All-Time by a Girl Group"", so no change with regards to record-breaking posts.  Again, let us know how you feel about this change.  Your feedback drives changes like this.

#### Related Subreddits

Thanks to suggestions by /u/CantadoraR and /u/EternityBlaze we have expanded the [Related Subreddits Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/relatedsubs) to include the following K-Pop TV shows and rhythm games:

**Rhythm Games**

* /r/superstarsmtown
* /r/SuperstarJYPNation 
* /r/SuperStarBTS
* /r/BeatEVOYG 

Please let us know if there any other subreddits you would like to see added to these lists.

#### Monday Q&amp;A

Thanks to a suggestion from /u/haplesspanda we have changed the default sort order for the Monday Q&amp;A thread to ""New"".  This change should help questions posted later in the day get more visibility and keep the thread active for longer.  Let us know what you think.

That's all we have for this month.  Thanks again for all of your feedback and keep it coming.  We'll see you again in July.",58,45

However, I had known about it for a while before that point. Prior to listening, I almost vowed not to even stick my toe in the water, because I had read about so many things in the industry that made me sad and angry. Granted, most of the things I'd read were from Western kpop news sites, such as AJ, and as a Westerner reading Western kpop sites, my perception of how the industry behaves will inevitably be skewed/blown out of proportion in some ways. Anyway, fast forward to November and I got caught up, though I honestly didn't want to. 

There are a looot of things about kpop that make me uncomfortable, angry, etc. For example I feel cynical concerning just how crafted idol images are. Obviously I'll never /know/ my faves, but I feel incompetent saying 'I like x idol's personality' when 95% of that image is a lie. I know that exists in every entertainment industry, but because kpop seems to be my biggest interest at this time, I'm more sensitive. Many times, I want to completely stop being interested, but I can't. 

Now I want to know if anybody else has attributes of the kpop industry that upset them to the point of wanting to drop kpop altogether. However, because of the music or something else, you stay interested and feel you'll just have to 'get used to it'. 

Sorry this is like, 3 paragraphs

Whenever I'm home alone, I like to dance to K-Pop songs in my parents' room because they have a big-ish mirror which helps me see if I'm any good at dancing. What they also have in their room is a low hanging chandelier that's like over 20 years old. 

So I was dancing to Wee Woo by Pristin and during the chorus, you have to have your arms high and lower them while following the beat. Well, I may have raised my arms a bit too violently and accidentally hit the chandelier and send a bulb flying across the room. 

The 20 year old bulb broke into a million and one pieces all over my parents' CARPETED floor and I knew immediately that I fucked up. 

I ended up telling my parents that I accidentally hit the chandelier while changing clothes because I couldn't bear telling them the real reason.

Also the downvote button is for if you find the post offensive (which you shouldnt because it is a opinion and i honestly want someone to change my mind because i dont understand the. Idea behind it). You should not downvote because you dont share the same opinion. In fact if you wouldnt mind possibly up-voting so more people can see the post and want to assist in you people in changing my mind.


I dont have a problem with K-pop. I think that it is very American based and from what Ive heard they are bigger in the U.S then any other country (including Korea its self). Whether this is true or not i dont know. 

I do however belief and know that K-pop stars and treated extremely poorly and get paid very low and are worked until breaking point.  Since there are many videos of these stars breaking down or throwing up on and off the stage.  This i believe that we can all agree is horrible and needs to change. Even though i dont personally like K-pop this is not okay. Some American artists and musicians have come out and said something along the lines of this. However there is no evidence of it as there is with K-pop stars. 

I dont understand the point in listening to music that you dont know or can comprehend the words too. However i do listen to lyrical rap. So that is also a unpopular genre (the lyrical part) in kids these days. They mainly like be beat and how it sounds.  Which Im assuming is why people that like K-pop listen to K-pop. 

Anyways again please dont downvote. I just want to see opinions. And this is also not the only subreddit Im going to be doing this with. I had this idea because this sub-Reddit was recommended to me. Have a nice day and leave some good arguments in the comments please!",25,0

Happy June!

7. [LOO/Chuu x Yves - Girl's Talk](https://youtu.be/ut7MyVIG9oI)

If you were wondering how these songs were picked: I chose songs based on 1) suggestions from u/rainshowerprince and u/alfredfjones, both of whom I asked and 2) [South Korea's picks for the LGBT Pride Festival in Seoul!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13FeWaAt-uH23sSrD3tYRxPwpWup3QMqpvioDZ5_NzQU/htmlview) Heart Attack by Chuu was #1 choice but we've already reviewed it, so instead we'll do the B-side single instead which is Girl's Talk. Rainbow was picked because 1) you can't have a jukebox like this one without a rainbow and 2) we haven't had a Rainbow song on yet!

If you need a refresher or instructions on how to participate in these, just refer back to [last week's thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8o360z/jukebox_38_bonjour_good_evening_%EA%B0%90%EC%82%AC%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4_excuse_me/?st=JI7Y20D4&amp;sh=5a39b8fd)

1. Numbers (**The8** from Seventeen, **Ten** from NCT, **One**, and **Seven**)
2. 1\-2 letters in the alphabet (**V** from BTS,** N from VIXX**,** L from Infinite**, **CL from 2NE1**, LE from EXID)
3. Periods (**D.O.** from EXO, **T.O.P.** from Big Bang, **C.A.P.** from Teen Top, and **S.Coups** from Seventeen)
4. Use of their real name or an abbreviated version of it (**Mark** from NCT and GOT7, **Sooyoung** from SNSD, **Seulgi** from Red Velvet, etc.)
5. It has to do with the weather, sun, and stars :P (**Sunny** from SNSD, **Rain**, **Solar** from Mamamoo, and **Byul**)

There are stars who are already famous in Korea, but near nameless overseas. The stars with different musical features travel overseas with no people that recognize them and take on the challenge of busking at different locations, with different environments, and different characteristics.

759,2018-6-10,2018,6,10,22,8q0ulf,Do any of y'all hear K-pop on the radio where you live?,space_camel,1528638048,"Context: I almost never listen to the radio anymore but I was in a Lyft last night around 11pm and the driver had it on Mix 96.1 which is one of the big pop stations where I live. I wasn't really paying attention and then I think I hear the DJ say Monsta X... I START paying attention and the DJ introduces MONSTA X and even gives some tour dates for their current world tour. They ended up playing a little over half of Jealousy as like a mix with some song I've never heard of but the second song was definitely american.

As someone who has been listening to this music for over a decade I honestly never thought that I could turn on the radio and hear one of my favorite kpop groups newest comeback. It's beyond surreal and I had to ask if the same has happened to y'all.

So my question overall is: Have y'all heard anything kpop on regular pop radio?? I've personally never heard Fake Love on the radio but it makes sense to be there bc of the billboard numbers lately, so if you've only heard that one that's okay too! 

This happened in South Texas btw",99,75

**Audience**: Being the first K-Pop event in Vegas in a long time (last one I know of was in 2011 with Shinee, 4minute, Sistar, and it apparently didnt sell well), I was worried at how many people would actually show up. However, this show was **PACKED**. The venue holds about 2.5k people, and it felt like 80-90% of the seats were filled. In contrast, when I went to KCon NY last year, it felt like 60% of the seats were filled in The Prudential Center, which can hold 19k people. 

The Audience was a mix of younger K-Pop fans (15-25) (Im assuming who were there for Ailee and EXID, and maybe Hwang Chi-Yeul)  and older Korean women (who Im guessing were there for Tak Jae Hoon and Hwang Chi-Yeul). I got to see noonas wave around light sticks, so this concert was worth it even before it started.

**The Show**: EXID opens the concert with Lady and then DDD. Tak Jae-Hoon and a translator then welcome the show and introduce EXID. Not a lot of English speaking from Hani apart from saying hello and introducing herself.  After that they performed Ah Yeah. I recognized that Hyerin was filling in for Soljis parts and wow, Hyerin is a **VOCAL POWERHOUSE**. She can hit high notes like crazy! Probably my new bias in EXID.

[Hot Pink](https://streamable.com/5cd79) was next (first few seconds of my video are upside down my bad] and then Up and Down was their last song of the set. I tried doing a Hani fancam (in honor of pharkil) but people got in the way during the second chorus T_T. Whatever footage I have Im happy with though. Confetti flew all over the crowd after Up and Down

Ailee was next and started her set with [U &amp; I](https://streamable.com/5l55f). Introduction break with Ailee saying it was her first time in Vegas and that her parents visited to see her perform. During one of the breaks, Tak Jae-hoon (acting as the MC for the concert) went on stage and had some banter with Ailee. But for some reason, they didn't bring out the translator from the first intro break with EXID, so I had no idea what they were talking about, but Ailee seemed having fun with it. I Will Go To You Like The First Snow was next with the audience waving their camera flash on their phones so it looked snow flakes. Ailee was very passionate while performing, you could feel the aura. Dont Touch Me was after and then I Will Show You. The instrumental backing for Ailees set seemed louder than the backing for EXIDs set, as in, you could feel the bass vibrate.

Another break, Ailee sings a bit of Heaven, I Will Always Love You, and Happy Birthday to a lucky fan. Final song of her set was [Atmosphere](https://streamable.com/xplqm) and THE BASS WAS SUPER LOUD AND YOU COULD FEEL THE GROUND SHAKE FROM EVERYONE JUMPING.

Tak Jae-Hoon was up next. He sang two songs. I didnt know his music, but he sings well. Also, had noticably fanchants during his performances. The noonas were loving him.

Built as the main act, Hwang Chi-Yeul closed the show. I didnt know who he was, BUT HE KILLED IT. I didnt know the two songs that he performed, but the crowd was loving him, fanchants and all. But, I immediately started to jam out when he did this Michael Jackson x JYP mashup of Billie Jean, Bad, and Smooth Criminal (dance covers) and Honey. That. was. Awesome.

His final song was a James Bond esque cover of BANG BANG BANG. The crowd was also jamming out to this.

Overall, pretty good show. Hopefully with the amount of people that showed up to this concert, we can get more K-Pop events in Sin City.

**TL;DR**: Venue was packed. Hyerin is a vocal powerhouse. Ailee is a vocal powerhouse. Hwang Chi-Yeul seems like a pretty cool guy.

Besides the many downvotes, there were some interesting coments of both people who agree and disagree with me. So I decided to bring this topic here.

Other example are kpop albuns sales and music show wins. Many kpop fans buy 2,3,4 and more albums which makes it difficult to have a true refletion of how many individuals are buying the albums. And of course this albums sales influence the music shows and award wins.

As most people know, most western fans from western artists don't have this mentality of boosting groups mvs on repeat and buying more than one album.

So my question is: do you think there is any truth in sales numbers and views and how it actually reflects the overall influence of kpop groups worldwide?",39,2

Flow wise: Mark-NCT (That boy is always consistent, he's only 18 internationally but he always finds a way to add his own color.)
Skill wise: B.I.-iKon (His song credits are crazy! He gets overlooked for the hype beast that is Bobby but he really is a force to  be reckoned with)
Swag wise: Jooheon- Monsta X (We have all seen the vids of him doing aegyo, but when he is on stage he transforms! He makes it look easy and like he's popping bottles in the club every night. I feel like his stage presence is almost intimidating.)

Some honorable mentions for flow:
Suga, Taeyong, TOP, E-Dawn

I'm from Germany so my English might not be the best, and I also cannot really concentrate right now.
I know it's stupid but I kinda feel like I should leave Kpop behind, it consumes my whole live but is still so unattainable :(
I know it's something us fans joke about often, but these last week's I have been feeling so much pain from being unable to have a connection with idols in real life...idk. I'm starting to feel more lonely than supported because of Kpop. It started to get really bad when I saw MONSTA X live last year. It was one of the best days in my live obviously, but afterwards, it was over soo quickly, I couldn't stop crying. I just couldn't believe that I had practically ""met"" them, but of course nothing had changed after seeing them. They still didn't know me (duh) and I still spend all my days daydreaming in my bedroom. Now, 3 days ago I saw got7 live in Berlin, and since then I just can't go on. I guess after got7 it's much worse than after Monsta X because I've been a fan since their debut, and with got7 I actually have got an ultimate bias since thw beginning. I'm supposed to study for my last exams right now, but all I can do is lay in bed and occasionally cry. I'm not even on my phone looking at videos me and my friends took at the concert or anything. I'm just laying around, dreaming about a life I could lead in a different universe in which I acutally do have some kind of real relationship with my bias :(
I KNOW it's so dumb, but I feel like Kpop has awakened alle these feelings me, but I somehow I just now realised that these feelings will always stay unrequited and unsatisfied. I may have never experienced real love before, but I'm honestly hurting much more right now than I did after breaking up with my boyfriend of 1 year :(( I don't know if there's any possible advice for my situation, but are there some of you guys who experienced something similar ?  Do you get this feeling that I'm trying to describe? :( I don't know how to go on without them (or rather him) in my life...In my REAL life ... 
I think what also could have been responsible for this situation, is that I met so many other fans for the first time. Dont get me wrong, they were all so lovely and respectful to each other, I don't think I'm feeling jealous or anything, but you just got soo aware that you're not an individual as a fan, you're just included in ""army"", ""aghases"" etc.
Idk how to explain this, its also hard for me to explain because of the language :( anyone understanding?",33,31

However, there's an interesting dynamic that I think is rarely looked at and that's the members who are directly in the middle.  Ones who look as a link between the older and younger members?  So I am interested to see how other people see the middle child of their faves.   
  
For me, I'll contribute the two easiest I know, RM and Jihyo.  Both leaders of their respective groups while also being directly in the middle in the age group.  I think an interesting thing these two have in common is that they are very frequent to give the spotlight and screentime to their other members to make sure they have a chance to speak, in fact I remember thinking this was a bit strange when Twice first debuted (and honestly still today a bit) because I felt like Jihyo never really got to put herself out there due to prioritizing making sure everybody else got to put themselves out there first and foremost.  She really feels like the real biggest sister of the group (because we all know it ain't ""I'm the oldest but when I aegyo, I'm the youngest"" Nayeon)

Suga from BTS has also expressed that he wants idols from smaller companies to succeed, so wouldn't idols like him be supportive of these groups that start on their own?

If a Hip-Hop label (tough run by Jay Park, a former idol) can appear, then a self-made group that gets signed later to a company (let's say 88rising who have worked with Jay Park and Kris Wu) after their debut they would also be able to appear on a show like that right? 

Recently an English speaking Korean youtuber ""Big Marvel"" said he's making a k-pop group and is also recruiting. 

It might not happen any time soon but maybe this could be the next big thing. Interested in hearing your thoughts!",25,22

In my time as a kpop fan (from 2014 up until now) Ive seen a lot of idols be shipped together. Of course Id hear the rumors but when I saw YouTube videos about it, the comment section was most interesting. A lot of people were replying to jealous fans saying hes/shes mine! And blah blah saying that they are human and deserve to want to love freely which I agree with. But the part that got me is when some people just freely stated I want to marry him/her someday. Not showing hate to the idol (and their friend or maybe even destined lover) at all but just stating their hopes. Maybe not even just on those idol ship videos but just on videos of their favs in general. This wouldnt happen to everyone but sometimes there would be this one commenter whom replied to them: you will never meet them, they will never know who you are, they are stars and youre you, hes/shes the hottest person on the planet though, it is impossible. All of these comments and many more variations of them led me to think this: if these people werent stars, would it still be impossible to marry them? Although I know idols have restrictions of whatever nature from maybe their companies and such but if they are human like everybody else and are able to love freely just like everybody else then why is it impossible for them to marry someone who may not be a star, or maybe not even be Korean? 

I know they may have many fans all over the world but I dont understand this logic:  eating ramen everyday cause they cant afford a good hearty meal and having multiple part time jobs just to support themselves = possible to marry 
 the second they become at the top or even just generally famous  = oops sorry honey 


I know theres stuff I may be missing but this post isnt meant to be really serious. Just curious on you guys comments!!! Do you guys think a non idol  can marry an idol? Or is it really just idols with idols and normies with normies? 



Thanks for reading!! (P.S. Im a hopeless romantic...I want to marry all my biases XD) ",5,0

Produce 48 recently had their press conference with all the mentors and judges displaying a very familiar hand symbol

*Processing img ay3ks1cfih311...*

2018:

*Processing img g17nenzgih311...*

2015:

*Processing gif vfox3cuhih311...*

2012:

*Processing img 6gmuheriih311...*

This hand greeting is in direct reference to their DNA helix logo that displays their ""crossing of genes"" across Asia, representing the integration of Chinese, Japanese and Korean members, being the first multiethnic group in K\-Pop.

2012

*Processing img 1ba4bq0oih311...*

2018

*Processing img zxhpodxoih311...*

Basically, it's been Cross Gene's hand greeting for a long time. K\-CandY and I\-CandY alike were not too pleased to see this.

https://twitter.com/dcc11e31429e499/status/1006304746854989824

https://twitter.com/preshslide/status/1006175523767275520

CandY are aware that this symbol was used by some contestants during the first live of P48, but we didn't think it was going to be something representing the entire show/group.

I know that colors and hand symbols can seem pretty trivial, but I think the context here is really what hurts CandY the most, and why it's so important to us.

Cross Gene debuted in 2012 under a Japanese company, Amuse, thus being the first and only K\-Pop idol group to be under a Japanese company while promoting in Korea. They faced discrimination upon debut and were called ""Japanese invaders"", you can check out their MelOn page for old comments. As Korea\-Japan relations aren't the greatest, it was to be expected, but the members representedunity: the 3 kingdoms of East Asia coming together for the first time in a K\-Pop group. Cross Gene continued to strive for peace through integration of cultures. Which is also why Takuya, the first fully Japanese Kpop idol, chose to be in Amuse's first Kpop group instead of just being a Jpop idol and staying in Japan.

*Processing gif r6uzhvvqih311...*

Takuya helped get Japanese idols in South Korea more respect through his works on Abnormal Summit as a Japanese representative. Takuya impressed the Korean public and gained Cross Gene many fans due to his eloquent speech on the show. So much so that CG's comeback charted at #66 on MelOn.

Cross Gene however have continued to face various discriminatory events throughout their 6 years as a group. For more details you can read this thread:

https://twitter.com/CrossGeneCandY/status/1001631856003956736

They've been very committed to their vision of a more integrated society despite all this, which is why they renewed their contracts with Amuse last year.

Their commitment to their artistry as peacemakers and those who accept all people no matter what sexual orientation, race or gender is so deep and they continue to showcase that through works such as their multilingual zombie apocalypse movie ZEDD.

*Processing img a9ggigvsih311...*

Cross Gene's hand greeting is a symbol of integration despite their hardships, and is a part of them that CandY would like to keep theirs, at least in the K\-Pop realm.Their greeting links the various aspects of Cross Gene and showcases their commitment to unity.

Cross Gene just had their 6 year anniversary on the day of the press conference. To have this sort of news come out the same day would be upsetting for anyone I am sure. CandY mean no harm to the contestants of Produce48 and we wish them all luck. But to see a symbol that represents a group being taken away after all the flack our group faced just due to the nation their agency comes fromis frustrating.  


Takuya starred on Mnet's ""The Lover"" drama. Lee Seunggi was under Amuse for his Japanese promotions since 2012. Hongki has met Cross Gene various times, most recently this past March with Takuya on his radio show. Cross Gene just ended their Touch It promotions 2 days ago andwere on Mcountdown's #8 the last week they performed on there. Cross Gene are #5 on Mnet's MAMA nominee poll for the month of June. Cross Gene are not obscure enough for no one to know they exist. If it truly was by accident we hope Mnet can apologize and stop using this symbol.

CandY could use all the support we can get. We don't mean to hurt the contestants at all. We simply need Mnet to give us feedback and gracefully resolve this issue. As a more senior group in the industry all we ask for is respect to Cross Gene.

I'm looking more at groups where members do not re\-sign their contracts after the 5/7 years \- wouldn't it be a good move to hold a concert for one last time? I'm pretty sure fans would want to see their favourite groups for one last time, and even for casual fans, the ""last time in your life this group is gonna perform together"" element of these concerts would usually draw them in? 

Of course, that's if the disbandment/non\-renewal of contracts are on good terms (the members want to pursue different things like acting) and not because of... not so favourable terms (company issues, lawsuits, etc). 

What are the groups that have already disbanded would you have loved to see for one last time at a Goodbye/Farewell Concert? Mine would definitely be Rainbow... and now that B1A4's extended contracts are ending by the end of June, i'm hoping they'd hold one :(",11,24

So I don't speak Korean unfortunately &amp; I really want to connect to songs on a deeper level so I would love to know what the best way to actually understand or get the most accurate english translations of kpop songs would be? Should I put the youtube captions on the music videos? or watch lyric videos or use a particular website? Im asking because every time I look up the lyrics or watch a lyric video the lyrics are always slightly or completely different &amp; I would like to know exactly what they are saying? 

Does anyone have any recommendations for particular sites or youtube channels etc to get the most accurate translation? P.S I would particularly like it if I could get some suggestions from people who actually speak both Korean &amp; english.  

Also I read somewhere that this website is good what are your opinions? [https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2016/09/agust\-d\-far\-away\-feat\-suran](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2016/09/agust-d-far-away-feat-suran)

For example EXO or BTS level, this could be possible. This is one sided only from your fandom. It's such a shame.

My family kids me for liking Kpop.  I explain why I like it. They don't understand. To me, it's another art form.  I love music of all genres from jazz, pop, rock, mexican, mariachi, salsa, Sinatra, Dinah Washington, Beatles, etc.  In 2016 I learned about Kpop and have enjoyed hundreds of performances on youTube.  I enjoy mostly girl groups.  I enjoy what Kpop is.  I appreciate what makes it Kpop.  It's so Korean.  I really like it.  The girl performers are beautiful.  While I'm in awe of some of the girl's beauty, I don't watch girl group performances because of their beauty nor do I lust for the performers. All ingredients that comprise Kpop are important and if any one ingredient is not there the performance may not get my attention.  The song, the music, choreography, the production, the presentation, group attitude and wardrobe must all work together (and usually does).  

I plan to attend my first KCON LA concert this year.  Being a male, I don't know what to expect being part of the audience.  My questions are : Are there many males at a Kpop concert?  Is it considered weird if a male attends.  What proportion of males are there to females at the concerts?  Any info is welcome.  Thanks for hearing me out.",35,205

East2West in general put in lots of effort into making sure outfits/concepts match the originals but their [Lionheart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKNsZZRBY5E) cover is extra special and well-executed.

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

This is actually my first time posting in this sub.  I hope I'm not coming off too strong by starting out with a question, but I'm a big music buff and want to learn more about K-pop as a musical genre.  I skimmed this sub a few times before, in hopes that I don't end up asking ""stale"" questions, but rather contributing to this sub in a meaningful way.

There seems to be a popular belief that, from a musical standpoint, K-Pop is just ""repackaged Western music"".  After listening to K-Pop for a few years now I really don't feel satisfied with this idea, aesthetics aside.  I do know that K-Pop does tend to delve into popular music genres, especially R&amp;B, Trap, Hip-hop, neo-soul, etc., but the way the songs are executed has always intrigued me.  Vocally, it seems like the artists utilize interesting chord progressions that aren't used in other musical genres, and that's what really catches my ~~eye~~ ear about K-Pop specifically.  

Is there anyone savvy enough in Music/Music Theory that can explain this.  It would be awesome to finally put a ""face"" to what I love about K-Pop so much!",17,29

It doesnt have to be realistic at all, just some fantasies and imagines youve had in your head for while!

Personally Ive always wanted to see EXO do a greek god concept. Every member could be assigned to be one specific God and they could make some short films/videos showing off every individual Gods aesthetic and everything.

For an MV, in my head, it would be all in an ancient Greek temple-esque location and every member would wear gorgeous robes fitting the aesthetic of the god theyre representing.

Its not realistic at all, but if it were, I think it would be too much for one MV and theyd have to do it as a concept album, which I would die for!

I asked the community of which track from 2018 I should give a remix,

and many asked for Love Scenario by iKON.

Super awesome track, I felt in love with it immediately and started working on it. The track reminded me of a track i made back in 2002. Thats why I combined the melody from the track with this.

Thank you all for being so kind and suggest tracks, I hope More will suggest some ideas and tracks to remix!

You can do that [Suggest Track to remix HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8nhyc8/suggest_a_track_from_2018_to_remix/)

Could someone recommend me a group or singer to start with? Or who is really considered the top right now. Who's popping and has a big push? Hiphop is pretty much my shit so I know it's a big leap, but i'm open to everything.

1163,2018-6-15,2018,6,15,18,8r9lcn,What are your K-Pop pet peeves?,The_Scentist,1529054330,"Basically, what's something that annoys you about K-Pop. Can be about the music, the groups, the companies, or the whole industry in general.

Me personally, I get annoyed whenever the person supposed to be singing is not placed in the front, or it's not indicated that they're the ones singing. An example is \[AOA's ""Confused""\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18fSsOulNYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18fSsOulNYw)). During the chorus, it's pretty obvious that Choa and Yuna are the ones singing. Yet they're at the back and it's not indicated through gestures that they're the ones singing. It's different from, say, \[MOMOLAND'S ""Bboom Bboom""\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLv5MBuSYDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLv5MBuSYDY)), where even though Yeonwoo is at the back during her ""Rendezvous"" and ""Mamderu"" parts, she's singled out as the one singing that part (she has her own steps for when it's her part). Or when Ahin sings her ""Ooh museun mari piryohae neon"", though she's not in the middle, she's in the front and has her own choreo during that part.

I know it's pretty minor and weird lol but it bothers me so much hahaha. So what are yours?",24,23

1202,2018-6-15,2018,6,15,23,8rbh5d,It's that time again... (Blackpink  initial reaction),BladeofFateX,1529073868,"That time where you listen to one song on repeat for like 2 weeks, you guys know what im talking about it. Something ive done with other really hype releases.

So at the start i honestly thought i had my phone upside down and had to flip it just to make sure. Then they pan in and the beat drops and im like okay this gonna be litt (lets talk about undersatements lol).

Anyways, the flash to jennie and lisa that say black pink and then to all the members on the chair throne thingy...i was dead already, that was my weekly dose of lisa and jennie.
     G  
Then of course like every song we start off jennie singing, as a queen (the queen i need in my life ya know?) On a chess board, with a dog. Reality check, we are all the dog, we have just succumbed to the greatness of this release and just sitting still as blackpink blesses us with their greatness.

V  BOOM, a parrot bird thing out of no where, and lisa comes in and instantly i start wondering HOW TF CAN I BUY THE BLACKPINK SWORD OMG #SLAYTHEMHATERS...honestly guys send me a link or if someone makes swords that a way to make money, i need it.
If that wasnt enough we have lisa teaching us how to use their new lightstick which was really controversial, i mean im still gonna get it but yea, some people dont like it...okay alot of people dont like it, but lisa used it in this video so im obviously gonna go get one so i can go learn some knowledge.
Lisa then proceeds to dance in the safe, where she somehow touches the ceiling with that amazing help from camera angle, and then you realize the outift shes wearing and that you obvously cant pull it off unless youre GD.

As for Rose and Jisoo we get a good couple seconds to appreciate their vocals and visuals as we build up to the chorus weve been waiting like, a year for.

I get hit with that  and the beat drops, heart stop, and suddenly i find myself dancing, and that means bodyrolling because you bodyroll to any song if you really think about it....just try it guys, makes dancing really cringe and easy at the same time.

....anyways, we get another part with jennie, her hat, which the size is completely neccessary, honestly though, when you have a tank you can do whatever tf you want.

Pink hair jisoo....i think thats what important for that part, game changer... also when  trips its a  .

We get another shot with rose, reminds me of swinging scene from touch my body and also sia's song.

BAM another chorus and we get lisa and jennie with golden hair wtf bruhh, its just keeps getting better.

Then we get rose for the bridge walking in some flowers hanging from the ceiling, fitting because she is a flower ya know. She says ""what you gonna do when i hit you with that uungh....honestly which one is that, like all the yg artists say that, lisa says it in  , mino says it in body, its literally the first sound GD makes in bad boy... i could go on. 

Then we get the breathtaking dance break that we all needed, and the song ends, and i realize that i can die happy now.

Hope you guys enjoyed the vid, gonna have to show my friends to spread the love

But for me, I'll never forget how I started with being a kpop fan.

I always remembered it so clearly. My brother just putting on a random music video, and it turned out to be Russian Roulette by Red Velvet. 

I fell in love immediately and checked out the album on Spotify, and loved the mini album. 

And that's one moment I'll never forget.

Sergio Leone called it Cinema Cinema. Taking your favorite part and reusing it. Slowly, Spaghetti Westerns gained recognition from the country they had emulated and are now, of course, considered masterpieces.

1241,2018-6-16,2018,6,16,19,8rinen,NUEST W WHO BOX TOUR,Dessidy,1529146530,"aka the day I almost met Aron and Baekho, and gained 40 twitter followers to break 100 followers total.  
  
Let us go back to how it all started. Two days ago Pledis posted an extremely cryptic [tweet](https://twitter.com/NUESTNEWS/status/1007286101944381441) on NUESTs twitter account. Four coordinates. LOVEs were quick to put the clues together and matched the coordinates with four places of high importance for NUEST W. Digital Media City, close to the recording studio where they got their first win. Hapjeong, where the comeback poster was. Korea University, where they had their first fan meeting. Olympic Park, where they held their concerts this march. There was also a time posted. 18.06.16 SAT 12PM-4PM.  
  
When this was posted I had just arrived to Busan with friends. The plan was to go home Saturday noon, but when this was posted I told them right away that I would have to leave earlier in the morning.  
  
Forward to today. I had to get up at 05:20 to get the 06:10 train and be able to drop off my bag and get something to eat before going. Since I live in the Mapo area of Seoul, DMC and Hapjeong was the two closest locations for me. I decided that the best route would be DMC  Hapjeong  Korea U  Olympic Park.   
  
At 11:30 I arrive at DMC, and it does not take long before I spot LOVEs. Someone has a fanclub totebag, someone has a NUEST keychain, someone carries a Baekho picket. Once you know what to look for it is not difficult to identify LOVEs. I follow the picket carrier to an area close to some lockers. More people are waiting around, so this is clearly the right location. Then we wait. More people appear. Suddenly Pledis posts on [twitter](https://twitter.com/NUESTNEWS/status/1007816304886026240) again. Clues! See if you can break the code and get the passwords from these pictures! ([Solution](https://twitter.com/ara__68/status/1007825729013219328)). Everyone immediately ran up to locker 3, as indicated by the tweet. I ended up in the middle of the group trying to figure it out, but within a couple minutes Pledis staff appears and order us into a line. It was somewhere here I realised [how many of us](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007820610150502401) there was. Once the clock passed 12PM we started to slowly edge closer. Fans figured out the password so quick. I eventually arrived to locker #3 and there were three things of note there. The first was a QR code on the inside of the locker door. When scanned it linked to a [locked youtube video of Baekho talking about the significance of this location](https://twitter.com/janinekwon_/status/1007822537605111808). The second item was a [mirror photocard](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007823975618052096), which is the colour version of Baekhos WHO teaser. (Yes, I cant spell and now its too late to fix). The third item was a message book to leave a message. Im not sure they will be able to read my scribbles, but I wanted to write something!  
   
The line was still long, but I met up with another LOVE I had talked to on twitter, and we decided to go to the next stop, Hapjeong, together. Hapjeong was only a few metro stops away, and this time it was even easier to figure out where to go. Just follow the running LOVEs after they get off the train. The line at Hapjeong was even longer, and [went in several loops](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007829724524146688). At this point pictures were all over twitter and it was difficult not to spoil. A few meters before we got to the front of the line I accidentally spoiled myself through my twitter notifications. This stop was JR. When we get to the front we realised that you have to show the code to get the photocard. At this point I had not figured out the code yet, but I managed to quickly glance at the girl in front of mes phone to see the code. I wrote it down on my phone, missed the stars at first and had to fix. While I was making errors while trying to type fast to correct it on my phone the girl gives me the photocard. Thank you super nice Pledis staff girl! We get the [QR code](https://twitter.com/janinekwon_/status/1007828447954010112) from another staff next to her, and then walk up to queue for the message book. While we are waiting for it the staff announce that they have run out of cards. This is at just before 1PM. An event scheduled for four hours ends in one hour because of the high demand. Pledis severely underestimated LOVEs.  
  
When we hear that the JR cards have run out, we consider it for a few seconds, and then decide to gamble and go to Korea U. It is the location furthest away, so they might not have run out of cards yet. So we jump on the metro. 45min. We are so many hopeful LOVEs. As soon as the doors open people are running. So guess what? I run too. There [is still a line](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007849526676328448), so photocards have not run out yet! So we line up and wait. In this line I finally figure out the clues. Woah, good Pledis! It is really smart. Then I am also running on about four hours on sleep, so I might not be my sharpest self. Suddenly in line there is screaming, and people starts to run to the front. I half walk, half being pushed in that direction by the sudden mob of people. It has to be one of the members! LOVEs are known to be a nice and chill fandom, and up until today all the LOVEs I have interacted with have been super sweet. So I dont recognise this sudden mob of people running up. [This was my view](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007851204016328704). It goes against my every belief to run up and mob an idol, so I stayed back, even if my view was limited. A few seconds later I found out through peoples phones and twitter that Aron had been there, but had to leave before he got to the box because people went insane. Aron leaves and we line up again. Not before long staff announce that photocards have run out. It is now 2PM. A full two hours before the event was supposed to end.  
  
What still makes me happy is that this really shows that we LOVEs are still here! Thousands of LOVEs showed up for this random cryptic event. We blocked up metro stations, we made people look and ask what we were doing. It was an amazing idea by Pledis.  
  
Meanwhile, tweets started to surface showing [Baekho visiting his locker](https://twitter.com/flowerisme77/status/1007852460092715010) at DMC. Cards here had obviously already run out, as it seemed a lot calmer there than at Korea U with Aron. Baekho got to [open the locker and read the notes](https://twitter.com/karitikoo/status/1007855756765347842).  
  
We had decided that there was no point in going to Olympic Park since Ren cards have most likely ran out as well. So instead we go to this [Baekho fansite exhibition](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1007877171401150465) I had planned to go to long before Pledis announced the box tour. I love fansite exhibitions and have gone to most I have heard of while I am in Seoul. I look at the photos, get my merch (trading caaaards!!), and then we leave to sit down at a caf for a bit.  
  
Of course we go on twitter again. [Aron went back](https://twitter.com/kjhyunibugi/status/1007867180262625281) after people left and was actually able to talk to fans and get to his locker. Ah I should have stayed. A few minutes later tweets start to appear from Olympic Park. [Ren appeared](https://twitter.com/togetherbeako/status/1007873605537968128). We should have gone [JR also showed up at Hapjeong](https://twitter.com/minyeo_dhgondew/status/1007859312016875521). He [got asked by an ajumma to help her with an ATM](https://twitter.com/F7213701/status/1007860024339644416), and he is of course too kind to turn her down. Someone please take care of this angel.  
       
Suddenly more tweets with Baekho appears while we are at the caf. [HE IS AT THE EXHIBITION WE JUST LEFT!!](https://twitter.com/realbaekhos/status/1007901111552958464) The amount of fan service NUEST W have given us today is unreal. I want everything for them this comeback, and I saw several people post on twitter about buying more albums and donating to streaming funds after today. Even though I never ended up seeing them personally, just knowing they went to the same locations make me smile. Today was such a good day. Please support these sweet kids with their comeback on the 25th.  
  
Also, since I never got to those QR codes Here are [Arons](https://twitter.com/janinekwon_/status/1007823782180876288) and [Rens](https://twitter.com/janinekwon_/status/1007826492280016896) videos.

Also shoutout to Gfriend, always, and Momoland with Bboom Bboom - they really go all out! What are your favourite hard hitting GG dances? What groups or choreos am I sleeping on?

So pretty much my friend is going to a new high school and she came across this girl in her orientation class. My friend did not give her number to the other girl, but instead my friends, friend gave it to the girl. In the picture she is referring to BTS as ""hers,"" and she wont stop bugging my friend about it. I'm actually starting to get worried.  Also, she said things similar to this when my friend and her were hanging out at orientation. I really don't know how to help my friend considering we don't go to the same high school. If you have any recommendations on how to deal with fans like this please leave them. I have anxiety issues and I'm worried about confronting her myself, but if that's what it takes for her to leave my friend alone, then I guess that's just what I'll have to do. At the end of the day i just don't want my friend to get attacked for saying the wrong thing, ya know?

We've also arranged meetups; there was a recent BTS meetup in London to bring fans together to celebrate the 5th anniversary of BTS.

We've had a bunch of kpop acts and hopefully getting more ~~(C'mon SM, bring your acts here).~~

We've had the likes of Dean, Monsta X, Dreamcatcher and soon, BTS, to perform here.

So it was comeback week and I decided to make a small trip for Korea to see BLACKPINK again. I had complications on the day of Music Core and wasnt able to get in, but was able to get into Inkigayo! Line up started at 5 AM, but I spent my time overnight near the venue. Ran into some fans I met a year ago and met some new ones. The BLINK fandom grew a lot, for Music Cores attendance it was 2.5 times as many people from AIIYL promos from what I saw. Inkigayo had a hard cut off capacity for some reason, but was still packed. Its nice to see everybody with the hammer lightstick, but waiting in line may annoy you since you hear squeaking every 10 seconds lmao. I waited next to these two Korean fans that were beating each other up with it the entire time. Quite the entertainment. 

The stage set up is gorgeousexpected from Inkigayo. Its a golden throne room with chandeliers hanging and all sorts of decorative ornaments scattered in the background. A neon pink blackpink sign hangs above the entire set. This looked like it was straight out of a music video. 

The girls wore these [outfits](https://youtu.be/IHNzOHi8sJs?t=2m46s) today. They were really cute when they first got on stage. Jennie, Lisa, and Ros came out together and shyly waved at us. Jennie said something about waiting for Jisoo lol. Ros started doing a huge goofy wave to all of us right as Jisoo came out. People screamed at Jisoos appearance and made Ros jump back from laughter. The girls got into formation for their first recording take. Pyrotechnics were used during the chorus (if I recall correctly). It was literally lit. 

The girls got off stage to prepare for the next take. It was quite the wait. When the producer called for the next take, we heard them cutely saying yes in Korean in the background. I tried to pay attention to each member during their parts this time around. Its actually so hard to focus on one member because theyre all alluring in their own way. Ros and Lisa really have sharp moves in their dancing and its really eye-catching. Jennie doesnt hit her moves as strongly, but the way she holds her self on stage is very captivating. Jisoo has shown tremendous growth in her dancing, she was really easy to watch. 

In their last take, they were asked to hold the ending pose for additional footage. The camera proceeded to pan on each member in the ending pose of the song. It was funny just watching the camera go up and down screening Jisoo for like 5 minutes. When that happened, the other three members pretty much just goofed off. Jennie and Ros just fanned themselves like crazy since the dance was really tiring. Lisa was just doing goofy Lisa things. When it was anothers member turn to pose for their personal cam, the other three would goof off and do all sorts of heart aegyo. After that, the recording was over. They said their good byes and thank you, gave us more hearts and waves. I still couldnt believe it took a year for this comeback. Well worth the wait tbh. 


Overall thoughts: the girls are just as lovely as ever, Teddy is a god at making bangers, and I love BLACKPINK.

I just finished watching Inkigayo June 17th 2018. Here is my experince:

Outside the Inkigayo building, there is a big line where everyone stands. The security checks if our names are on the list (ticket system works by VIP or ticket drawing system) then we go stand in line. 

First let me explain how inkigayo organizes their stage system of idols. They record EVERY OTHER stage. This means for example blackpink's ddu du ddu du and forever young are in seperate times. They fit it so it looks continuous. I think there are 3 lines depending on time. 

1st line sees 1/3rd of all performances
1st line gets out, 2nd line goes in.
2nd line sees 1/3rd of all performance
2nd line gets out, 3rd line goes in.
3rd line sees last 1/3rd of all performances.

During the 3rd line, inkigayo goes live. 

I was part of the 2nd line, where I saw AOA's bingle bangle, Blackpink's Forever Young, etc.
So I did not see Wanna One, Blackpink's ddu du ddu du, etc.

Interesting things I noticed:
All the cheering and clapping are fake. All the fanchants are fake unless the fans actually did it. They are added in. The audience does not clap at all except for really popular ones like ShiNee or Blackpink or AOA. During Emcee moments, the clapping and cheering are fake as well. 

Also, no one had light sticks in general except for ShiNee for my line. 

For girl group singers that are suppose to have high pitch voices, they add really high pitched autotuned voices with their voice to seem like their voice is higher than it really is. For example, Ros's nd Jisoo's voices were autotuned with their voices to seem more higher. Jennie and Lisa's voices are suppose to be lower so they do not add auto tune. 

The security is really strict about no photos or videos. Every aisle there is one security guard. 

If you ask, the guards let you go to the front to stand and see the performances closer, but it must be done between performances.

In general, all the groups even the underrated ones and rookies did great, and the emcees were great as well.

TL;DR:
Performances are not continuous.
Cheering and clapping are fake.
They add auto tune sometimes.
Great performance overall.

Proof I went there (I snuck 2 photos before security said no photos):

It was a couple years ago when I heard it so it's at least from 2 years ago, I remember clearly the start of the videoclip, there was a big white fancy gate to a garden [similar to this](https://imgur.com/a/cpLtGH6) and a big green garden behind, it was a full girl group and they all were with white clothes. I found this song with youtube automatic reproduction and the one I was listening before was ""Dumb dumb from red velvet"" so maybe it's from this group or a similar one?

It was a girl group. Probably 5-9 members. I dont know if it was an official MV or just a performance. Probably just an outdoor performance since I remember it being in what appeared to be an outdoor mall. It was sunny and bright. The thing that stands out the most in my memory is during the dance break the music got extra techno sounding and the girls dance was really fast small steps that made them look like they were floating along.

Taking it seriously I found this pretty difficult but came up with:

Minho (SHINee), Suho (EXO), Yeri (Red Velvet), Taeyeon (SNSD). All used as vocalists. Their dominant sound would be contemporary R&amp;B, sort of Replay-esque. They have tones that I think would be able to mesh and personalities that work well together, and could hold a decent variety presence with the boys allowing the girls to take a backseat if they need to.",10,16

1361,2018-6-18,2018,6,18,11,8rw5g7,180617 WINNER World Wide Inner Circle Fanmeeting,UndercoverChaebol,1529289750,"The World Wide Inner Circle Conference (WWIC) 2018 was WINNER's first Korean fanmeeting since 2015. In YG style, they held two sittings in one day and this year's took part at the Seoul Olympic Hall in the Olympic Park (the same as iKON's fanmeet last week). The total fanmeetings ran about 2.5 - 3 hours (very long!) and I'll do some short recaps for all those Inner Circles who couldn't attend (since tickets sold out in minutes). I live in Canada, but I happened to be visiting Seoul to see my ults, which I am very, very thankful for. 

**Getting Tickets**: I bought both my tickets second-hand, one from a re-sale website that I had shipped to my AirBnB owner (you need a Korean address) and the second I bought from a fan on Twitter who I met up with that day. My seats for the first show were floor, and I had an amazing view of the stage. My second seats were on the second floor but right at the walkway, so when WINNER came up into the audience they were RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. I was honestly shaking so all my pictures are terrible, but this is the closest I've ever come to idols that wasn't a fanmeeting (I did one with Day6). Seeing idols sing to you that close, and seeing WINNER's white mics that I've only watched from afar for years, is a privilege. We all know they're pretty, but they're more than that, they're ethereal. 


**Hair**: I just want to mention that Mino is HIGHLIGHTER YELLOW and Seungyoon is blonde again, send tweet. 


**Setlist**: WINNER performed Everyday, Air, an Everyday Part Switch, and Everyday 2x dance, We Were, Movie Star, La La, Don't Flirt, Hello, Really Really, and Everyday again. Everyday seems very well loved by the fans, and the singing along was loud and second only to Really Really. The Everyday stage was simple and allowed us to focus on their singing and dancing, and WINNER seem to have a lot of fun doing the dance. They also look much less awkward then they do in the music video, and they didn't have backup dancers. Air is sublime, especially thanks to Seungyoon, and We Were is one of my favourites because the chorus is so triumphant and sweet. There's a feeling of nostalgia when they sing it. La La is also just so fun, and the boys have so much fun dancing to it and singing to it. The audience gets really hype during La La as well, cheering loudly. It's always been a good concert song since it came out in 2016, and I'm glad they still do it and seem to love performing it. I also thought they would be tired by then, but they seemed happy and energetic even at the second showing. Also shout-out to Mino for doing half of Okey Dokey even though they only used it as background music. He went IN until they cut him off, and we were all very sad because the crowd was IMMEDIATELY lit when he started rapping. Mino is going to have a solo concert one day and it's going to be wild guys. My absolute favourite moment however was Movie Star, which must be the new fan song. The Movie Star stage was amazing, they played footage of WINNER backstage and together in black and white on the screens and everyone was wearing deep reds and dark colours. The audience sung along to the chorus very sweetly, and you can tell that WINNER made this song specifically for fans. It has the same feel as Smile Again, but without an undercurrent of struggle. Every song is a love story, but Movie Star is my favourite. 


**VCRS**: Why am I giving VCRs a shout-out? Because WINNER's were the most fun VCRs I've seen. They each had a solo VCR where they parodied popular Korean commercials that also played to their personalities. Seunghoon imitated JooE's Tropicana commercial with blonde pigtails and all, and Seungyoon did an ad for ""Songminos"" Pizza instead of Dominos. Jinu did an ad where he talks slowly and has a conversation directly into the camera, which the fans ate up, and Mino advertised ""WINNER King"" by dramatically eating a burger. They were such clever and fun VCRs. They also did a clip with all four of them where it's just their heads chanting over and over again (I can't find the original right now), which we all laughed at a lot. There were some VCRs where WINNER mentioned their wishlists for the future, and another segment where they played pre-recorded games. 


**Games**: The games were standard idol-games:sSpin the wheel and do what they say, like aegyo or 2x dance, draw things from a box like dancing to girl-group dances (Mino and Seungyoon danced to TWICE), do something sexy (they all rolled their bare shoulders at us, even Jinu, and man are they all THIN BOYS), ride tiny bikes and play with random items (Seungyoon made a heart for Inner Circle out of a coat hanger, Seunghoon draped a noodle from his ear and said he was Mino with his earrings). My favourite part was a clip where they read fan messages and requests, and one request was a game where they have to guess who's who during a certain action. So Jinu stood in front of the desk and they all went behind him and hid and sniffed and he had to guess who was who, which he did! Then they were all ""daebak!!"" so they made him do it again, and this time instead of all three sniffing, it went Mino-Seunghoon-Mino and Jinu got it right immediately. He can tell his members apart from their SNIFFING. It was wild. 


**Member Rants**: 


**Kim Jinu**: Jinu is one of the most gentle idols I've ever seen, and he tends to speak a little softer than everyone else, but still laughs a lot and has outbursts or moments where he's loud (when he's angry or laughing hard). WINNER seem to have a very comfortable and loving dynamic with Jinu, and they know exactly how to draw out answers from him or know when he's finished with a thought. He also knows he's considered cute AF and does some not-so-subtle fan service, such as making cute faces and then immediately being embarrassed afterwards. Mino tends to laugh at him and with him the most, and Seunghoon pays him the most attention when he's talking or taking part in activities. He tends to talk to the members directly, so sometimes his back is to the audience, and he likes to whisper comments in their ears. 


**Lee Seunghoon**: Seunghoon held my hand!!! They were very, very soft. Seunghoon is the kind of giving the fans what they want, and he tends to be the loudest on stage, making comments and laughing a lot. His dynamic with Seungyoon is very playful, and both him and Seungyoon can probably feed off each other's energy endlessly. Seunghoon wants to make fans happy, so he'll be silly and sexy and sweet in turn when it's appropriate. He really is the dancer, you can tell by the way he casually freestyles or moves his body to the music. He laughs at fans a lot too, and is constantly happy on stage. He also is the most encouraging of the other members when it comes time for them to play games or share their thoughts, and his acrostic poems are always fun and well-done. He has an affectionate relationship with Jinu (they all do) and with Mino he seems to tease a lot (they also all do that). I think Seunghoon and Seungyoon both have the same approach to Inner Circle, in which they want to give the fans what they want and be happy doing it. 


**Song Mino**: Mino!!! Mino is charismatic on stage, and when you're looking at him you can sometimes get so caught up in how seriously he takes his work. When he's rapping he's focused and powerful, and when he's singing he does it with care and quiet enthusiasm. I think Mino wants to be seen as cool more than anything is (you are cool, Mino) but he's also a silly man who everyone loves to make fun of. They all seem to rib him for things he says and things he does (he acted like a dog at one point) and they all have fun laughing at him. Seungyoon and Mino together are a special combination because I think it's clear how close they are. They play off each other quickly and pick up on things immediately, which leads to very funny conversations and bits that the fans adore. But on top of that is a seriousness and a love of his craft that shows through all the smiles and jokes, and you see it in moments where he's working his hardest. Mino can be a lazy dancer but for the fanmeeting he worked hard and (and was tired). I think he knows he's got a lot of individuality and wants to be seen as unique on his own, but with WINNER he's with family, and he seems happy enough to always try and make other members (especially Jinu) shine. 


**Kang Seungyoon**: I saved Seungyoon for last because he looked right at me for a second and I could feel my soul leave my body. Seungyoon has IT, that extra charismatic factor, whatever you want to call it. Seungri and Hoseok from BTS have the same thing, as well as Key. They're on another level when you see them live, and I truly feel for everyone who hasn't had the chance to see Seungyoon live because he really is no joke. He seems truly happy and comfortable in himself when he's on stage or when he's talking, and he's really funny and laughs a lot at himself and everyone else. He's also a maknae leader, so he often gets treated like the maknae when the others are teasing, but when he needs to act like the leader by guiding events or discussions they all listen to him without even a moment's hesitation. I think his unique position has made them all very close, as they respect him so much as a leader and also show a lot of love for him as the maknae. If anything, sometimes it feels like he isn't a leader at all, and WINNER are just a group of friends who love hanging out and being with one another. Seungyoon was BLONDE too (superior Seungyoon???) and he's lethal. When he came into the audience RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, he was moving to the music and singing Don't Flirt at the same time, and he did it so effortlessly and with such a big teasing smirk that I kind of wanted to internally combust. I think Seungyoon KNOWS he's got an effect on people, because he plays into it and uses it to disarm people with eye-contact and singing into their cameras and dancing ""sexy"". Whew. Seungyoon's vocals are also NO JOKE. He's the real deal. His adlibs are unlike anyone I've seen except perhaps Jonghyun, and like Jonghyun he's got a beautiful, powerful, unique voice that is meant to be heard. 


**Overall**: WINNER are so talented and beautiful. Their fanmeeting showed how funny they are and what a great friendship they have, and it felt like we were sitting in on their everyday life, interspersed with great music and performances. Every WINNER song is meant for them and they've perfected their stages with them. They're comfortable and most of all they seem truly, truly happy. I don't miss them or have post-concert depression because I couldn't have ever asked for anything more. They gave us everything we wanted and still seemed to be genuine, kind, silly boys while doing it. They've grown a lot, and they're really loved by their fans. I hope we get to stay with them forever. ",14,87

I was really lucky to get in to this fansign with the help of an album group order I did! It was my first Loona unit fansign, and I was really excited when I saw that I was one of the winners announced. With less than 24 hours from when the winners were announced to the actual fansign I kind of had to rush to get everything ready...

As a perk for those who joined my fansign, I offered to give letters and gifts from those that joined directly to the members, so I had to gather those up really quickly. I also wanted to give each member a copy of a print I did especially for the GO, of yyxy. [You can see it here!]( https://imgur.com/a/nQhDUIC)

I got there a little early and caught the tail end of another fansign for the boy group On&amp;Off. Theyre really cute! They did a mini performance at the end and it was nice to see the fans there so happy and pleased. After the boys left, they cleaned up the area and some indie musical artists played for a bit. While waiting, [I set up my album with the name post-its and everything,]( https://imgur.com/HCU5YBZ) since I didnt have time to do it before hand.

Around 5:30 we signed in and drew numbers for our seating positions. I got 44, so kind of right in the middle of the 100 people in the sign. I got a pretty good, close seat, but sadly a good majority of the time Yves and Oliva were blocked a bit from my view. :(

Around 7pm, the girls came in! I had seen them before in person up close at the Line&amp;Up event but man, what the fuck, they are SO gorgeous in person. Like I probably looked like a troll that lives under a bridge compared next to them, and Im pretty average looking lol. Their makeup and hair were flawless, and they are so petite and cute in person. Im not usually one of those fans that gets overly squee-y in public but even I kinda let out a dawwww when they came on stage! They introduced themselves and said a few words about how they were thankful for everyone coming and to support love4eva, yyxy, and LOONA as a whole, and the signing immediately started.

I got to snap a lot of pretty good pictures at the beginning. My friend who was waiting outside of the sign in the public area (it was a public fansign, not behind closed doors) had leant me her camera since Id stupidly forgotten mine. Any time a member wasnt preoccupied with a fan in front of them, she would play cutely with the audience. I was directly in front of Chuu, and when she saw me taking a picture she waved and did finger guns! (Ive included an album at the end with some pictures) I clutched my heart and pretended to be wounded and she laughed and gave me finger hearts :( Shes so so SO adorable. All of them are, but Chuu really does the aegyo persona super well. Shes a natural at being bubbly and cute. There was a girl next to me who was a Chuu stan, and every 30 seconds she was spamming her twitter with CHUU IS SO CUTE I CANNOT FUCKING STAND IT I LOVE HER and even though I was half thinking girl, calm yourself, I was also half thinking uh... same.

About 30 minutes or so in to the sign, I was called up to stand in line by the stage to go up. I was a bit nervous, but the girls were really sweet and warm/welcoming that I just bit the bullet. One poor girl right in front of me tripped up the steps when she went up there, and poor Yves looked like she was deadass about to leap out of her seat to go help her. She kept touching the girls arm and asking Are you okay? Are you okay? But finally it was my turn!

First up was Yves. My spot in the audience had Yves blocked by huge fansite cameras most of the time, so it was my first time getting a really good look at her. Gosh, shes SO pretty. Shes got such a big, warm smile. I immediately started off the conversation with the same opening lines that I would give every member: Hi, my name is Kiki, Im from America. My Korean isnt the best, so Im sorry if I make any mistakes. Yves didnt even let me finish before she was patting my wrist and saying Its okay, its okay! Your Korean is good! Then, in English, she asked me, Where are you from? In America. Her English is really cute;;;;; Shes got such a soft, deep voice. Shes so pretty in person, like how is a person allowed to exist with virtually zero pores on their face???

The rest of the conversation was in Korean. I told her I was from Chicago. She asked me if I live in Korea, and I said yes, Im studying Korean here. She said, Ah, thats why unnies Korean is so good. I got a bit flustered there and said that LOONA has a lot of foreign fans. She said, really?! I want to go to America! 

Then she looked down and saw my open album for her. She said Kiki is your name? Thats a cute name! [Here is her sign!]( https://imgur.com/PMTcnl2) She signed the page I had chosen and looked over to find my post it question attached. Because my Korean isnt totally fluent yet, a lot of the signings were filled more with them concentrating on the posts its than conversations like with other fans. I was fine with that! I love how much thought they put in to the post its, since I put a lot of thought in to what I would ask!

[Here was my post it.]( https://imgur.com/vR0jdGO)

Q: Yves~ You inspire me a lot! Who inspires you?

A: YOU! Kiki &lt;3

When she read the question she looked up at me and said you! And she wrote it down,,,, She said fans inspire her to do great things. She hopes that the fans will continue to inspire her every day. Red faced and already flailing at just the first of four members, I handed her the yyxy print I had made them. On the back was a little note that just said I had drawn this for yyxy to support them. Yves said, in English, I LOVE! I WILL HANG IT IN MY ROOM!.  I dont remember much else because honestly that was the cutest thing and the best thing I could ever hear as an artist drawing art of people I really adore!! I said thank you, and slid on down to Go Won~

Go Won is my yyxy bias, and she looks so much like a cute valley girl barbie doll with her blonde hair pulled back in to a ribbon and her bright smile. She is SO CUTE. And you know? Her hands are really small and cute... like shes just tiny all over. I definitely was feeling the bias feelings when I got up to her.

I told her my introduction, and just like Yves she said its okay, its okay! Your Korean is good. Its cute. I said thank you! I told her I tried to get in to the inkigayo performance that morning but wasnt fast enough to get tickets. She said next time, call me. Ill get you a ticket. And she giggled, arghhh so cute! [She signed the page to Kiki-nim and said Kiki is a really cute name.]( https://imgur.com/2ivTAEd) I told her that I love listening to love4eva a lot because its so happy and fun. I asked her if they were excited about Grimes featuring on the song and she said it was so cool! She mentioned what I think (?) was her saying she never imagined it could happen. I told her I was really excited for August since I saw them at Line&amp;Up and she told me thank you for supporting the concert!
Short intermission to mention that I cannot explain how cute Go Won is in person. She is so naturally adorable. Where Chuu has perfected the really sweet, cute persona, Go Won kind of has a more shy/cute persona. Shes very attentive when you speak with her, and after apologizing when I tripped over my words in Korean (my Korean isnt usually this bad, but I was flustered;;;; ) she kept telling me that I must study very hard to be so good. I told her I came to Seoul a few months ago and love living here. She said she wants to travel a lot with LOONA.

[After signing she read my post it.]( https://imgur.com/LpR9h4E)

Q: Chaewon-ah~ Do you like Harry Potter? Which house do you think your members belong in?

A: 

-Slytherin: Hye

-Hufflepuff: Yves-unnie

-Ravenclaw: Chuu-unnie

-Gryffindor:

After thinking about it she said she doesnt know what exactly house she belongs in. I said maybe shes a Hufflepuff. I think she saw through my ruse because she said, Ah, is it because youre a Hufflepuff? I trust unnies judgement!

;_________________________;

I gave her the print I had drawn, as well as the art of a friend who had drawn her as well, and she said that both of them were so pretty, and that she wanted to hang them over her mirror! She said, you drew this? You drew it? Its lovely!

After thanking her, I moved down to Chuu!

Chuu is SO BRIGHT AND BUBBLY. This girl has so much energy. Its not that any of the other members were lethargic or got tired, but Chuu was just on 101% the entire sign. Shes the queen of fanservice in yyxy. On short breaks between fans she would constantly wave and interact with the crowd, making sure to give anyone who called out to her lots of attention and pose for cute photos. When I moved down to her I was standing up, and she looked up at me with this wide smile and motioned for me to come sit down in front of her. (I caught her on camera doing something similar, which you can see in the video at the end of the post!) 

Like the others, after my intro she told me everything was okay, except hers was like more aggressive (?) lmao. She was like DONT YOU DARE SAY THAT, YOU ARE GREAT. I was like, yes, youre right, how dare I. Chuu is the one I didnt chat with the most only because [she spent a long time decorating her page in my album![( https://imgur.com/16oUg1d) Shes sooooo adorable and generous, haha. I said Jiwoo-ah is so cute. And she said, in third person, Jiwoo-ah is the cutest, right? I think so. Please tell everyone Im the cutest. She said Kiki was a cute name, I said Chuu is a cuter one. She said theyre cuter together, and she went Ki-Ki-Chuuuu.

You know, normally Im not a fan of crazy aegyo but omg when Chuu does it it just melts your heart;;;;;

[Next was my post it!]( https://imgur.com/Tpsl5Fj)

Q: Jiwoo-ah~ I think penguins are adorable, and they make me happy. Please draw unnie a cute penguin with a short message to cheer me up when I am sad~ &lt;3

A: A Chuu-Penguin for/to be with unnie!! &lt;3

Yall Im pretty sure my soul left my body from the cute right then and there, and since Ive just been a husk.

After giving her my drawing, she said that it was really beautiful and said Unnies art is as pretty as unnie herself. ?!??!?!

I thanked her and moved down to Olivia! Olivia for me is the most striking member of all of LOONA. Its no secret Loona is made up of all seriously gorgeous girls, and Id be hard-pressed to try and pick who I thought was the prettiest. But Olivia is just so striking in person. She has really sharp, elegant features, and shes super soft-spoken. Shes what I like to call the gothy aegyo. Shes got her long, dark hair and her AMAZING resting bitch face (seriously I love her so much) but shes really respectful and sweet-natured and shy in person. When I told her I was sorry for my piss poor Korean, she said that it was very good, and that she knows studying is really hard. She said something to me that I didnt quite pick up, so I had to tell her that I didnt understand, and she smiled and laughed and said, in English, Great [Korean]! She gave me a thumbs up and said Dont worry! 

[This is the page I had her sign.]( https://imgur.com/qyrf8a0) My heart fluttered a little when she signed it to Kiki-unnie,,,, I dont know why, but idols using terms like unnie/noona/oppa/hyung with their fans just makes you feel super fuckin doki doki, and I get that thats part of the idol experience package lmao but hell it worked like a charm on me. She got me hook, line, and sinker.

When she read my post it, she laughed really hard. [Here was the post it.]( https://imgur.com/jrlR4L0)

Q: Hyejoo-yah! You said you arent afraid of heights. Im really afraid of bees;;; Please draw for unnie what you ARE afraid of!

A: (drawing)

Most of the context of this answer is in the conversation we had! She drew what is supposed to be a rollercoaster. She said that going up isnt scary (because she isnt afraid of heights) but that the BIG drop at the very top right after really freaks her out. She said that its always fun up until that point, and that she doesnt know why she keeps going on rollercoasters when she knows they scare her so bad, lol. She said the ticking(?) sound, when the cart is being pulled up the tracked and when its released and starts clicking really fast right when everyone is quiet and about to drop is the most anxious. She made a cute sound of the ticking while twirling her finger. It was adorable! I said rollercoasters scare me a lot, too. She said bees are really cute tho, and I was like oh ye. If u say so, Hye.

Lastly, I gave her my print and she asked if I had drawn it. I said yes, and she said Unnie, your art is pretty! I look pretty in this. I said she always looks pretty and she bowed and said thank you while holding the print in both hands. So cute! Thats most of what this fansign can be summed up as: cute cute cute cute uber cute.

After my turn, there was about 45 more minutes left of them signing! I spent that time putting my post its and previews up on twitter, as well as taking some more photos. I was really distraught when RIGHT AS SOON AS THE SIGNINGS WERE FINISHED my camera decided to die. :( So as soon as they were standing and interacting a bit and the fans werent in the way I couldnt get any good higher quality photos :( For my next time Ill definitely bring back up chargers and batteries....

After the signings they said a few ments, played around with each other a bit, and posed for some cute photos! They each said their individual thank yous and then the sign was over, and they left waving as everyone cheered and said good bye. Im pretty sure the chuu fangirl next to me almost had a heart attack (no pun intended) when Chuu had to be ushered away by the staff when she refused to stop throwing hearts at the crowd. (Once again, same.)

And that was the sign! It was such a fun and memorable experience. I literally get so red when I think about the girls having my art hanging up on their wall!! :( Thats such an amazing feeling. I hope JinSoul has my art that I did of her hanging up as well. I plan to have a print for all 12 girls at their first OT12 sign in August when they debut! Hopefully Ill get a spot in one. Wish me luck!

As promised, here are the albums of photos I took at the sign. Disclaimer: I am not a fansite, so I dont take fansite quality photos. Im also not a professional photographer, so my photos arent HQ by any means. Also, I tried to get more of Yves and Olivia, but they were blocked most of the time from my camera of a full unobstructed view. :( 


[Here is the photo album!](https://imgur.com/a/rYzvxLL)

I also uploaded a short video of footage I got at the sign. Its only of Chuu and Go Won (again, lots of fans in the way of Yves and Olivia), but hopefully at the next sign I can get more of all of them &lt;3 

[Heres the link to the video!]( https://youtu.be/OcMRSlITgW8)

Thats it for this fan account. I really hope you all enjoyed it, I can say that as beautiful and sweet and adorable and cute as they are on camera, it is 1000000005% better in person. They really are professionals at what they do, and theyre so warm and inviting with their words and body language. I cant wait to see them debut in August &lt;3

Cheers!

1447,2018-6-19,2018,6,19,11,8s5hms,Why is Black Pink not as good at performing as other YG artists?,psychorant,1529376943,"I posted this in r/BlackPink, but wanted to put it here because more people = more thoughts.

Before I start, I do like Black Pink and they all seem great as well as super talented. However, with their latest comeback I've noticed that, compared to other YG artists, their performances aren't nearly as exciting or engaging. They don't seem to be improving to the level of other YG artists either. I want to know if you guys have noticed this and why you might think they haven't?

When you compare their stages to 2NE1, Big Bang, iKon or Winner, they aren't as involving or as enjoyable to watch. By this I mean things like audience interaction, not sticking so strictly to choreography 100% of the time, and looking like they're having fun while performing. Even at awards shows, compared to other YG artists there's a clear difference of stage presence. Out of all the YG line up, I think BP is the worst at putting on performances.

I used to think that maybe they'll improve over time, but then I consider how iKon &amp; Winner were both great at performaning since debut. I know both teams (+ Lee Hi) went on the YG Family Tour in 2014 so got firsthand experience with Psy, Big Bang &amp; 2NE1 on how to perform so maybe that's  it?

Basically, I'll be in Korea in a few weeks and I want to preorder an album there so I can pick it up. It'll already be released by the time I'm in Seoul so I can't preorder it when I get there.  I really want the preorder benefits and since shipping is so expensive, I figured picking up an album I preordered earlier would work? I thought about ordering it online on gmarket (or something) and getting it shipped to the address I'll be staying at but my Korean is pretty bad (won't be able to explain it to the seller properly) and I'm only there for a week so I could miss it. Has anyone tried anything like this before or know how to go about doing this? Any particular stores I should try?

Thanks for the help x",0,1

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**Voisper Official Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_voisper/)

* Date Project Ends: June 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Voisper?

Voisper is a four-member vocal group signed to Evermore Music.

The groups name comes from the meshing of **voi**ce and whi**sper**. The groups origins are actually kind of cool. So, all the members were actually close friends in high school, where they decided to become a vocal group in their 2nd year. They auditioned for the sixth season of *Superstar K* in 2014 under the name North Incheon Nineteen. From what I could see on Wikipedia, the group didnt make it to the finals though. However, they signed to Evermore in 2015, where they changed their name to Voisper.

The group officially debuted in February 2016 with the song [In Your Voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDIOpnJkes)"". In 2017, they made a splash in the ballad scene, performing on *Immortal Songs* a total of seven times that year. They had their first win on the show with their performance of Kim Kwang Suks [Letter to a Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf9lVwKr7Jk)"".

If youre a ballad person, I highly recommend you check their *Immortal Songs* performances. I personally am a big fan of their performance of Park Hyo Shins [Snow Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sgvkIaA2FM)"". I really wish theyd do more ballad because their vocals + harmonies are amazing.

Their most recent comeback was a digital single in early 2018 named [Missing U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R4wdqRcWRI)"".

[**Kim Jaejoong PHOTO PEOPLE in PARIS Limited Edition Goods Pre-order**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/md_kimjaejoong/)

* Date Project Ends: July 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Kim Jaejoong?

JYJ/DBSK is a legendary group on the sub, so I don't need to write much about who Jaejoong is. But if you want to read more about his solo activities, you can click [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jae-joong)

[**Girlkind Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_girlkind_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 10, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Girlkind?

Girlkind is a five member girl group signed to Nextlevel Entertainment.

Prior to the group's debut, member  Xeheun (previously known as Seheun) participated on the first season of *Produce 101*. However, she was eliminated during the first round of cuts, and placed 93rd in the competition.

The group officially debuted in January 2018 with the song ""[Fanci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRoednGUmCE)"", which became kind of a meme on the sub because of the ""all my hood unnies"" line. The group's most recent comeback is the song ""[S.O.R.R.Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDXOm5WGjs)"".

[**Chloris Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_chloris_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 16, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Chloris?

Chloris is a four member girl group signed to FAB Entertainment.

Based on a quick google search, I'm assuming that the group's name (and fan club name) is derived from the Greek Nymph of the same name, who was associated with spring, flowers and new growth.

The group debuted in November 2017 with the song ""Friday Night"". I wasn't able to find an official MV for the song on YouTube, but you can watch a fancam performance of the song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMDknoN-Ang).

I haven't been able to find too much else about the group in English (besides the typical k-pop stats), but the group's fan club name is Chlover.

The group also has a variety of SNS pages, which can be viewed [here.](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/female_artist_profiles/c/chloris-profile/)

[**BLK Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_blk_01/)

* Date Project Ends: June 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is BLK?

BLK is a seven member acrobatic boy group signed to J&amp;B Entertainment. The group's name is an acronym for Beyond, Limit, Key.

The group initially debuted with six members in November 2017 with the song ""[Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5W_db8D00)"". New member MingMing (of MIXNINE fame) was recently added after the show concluded and this upcoming comeback will be his first with the group.

While I can't verify all the information myself, various sites list some very interesting information about the members.

* Leader D.A was a former member of LC9, who went under the name of AO.
* Taebin was a former DSP trainee and trained with the KARD.
* MingMing was a former PLEDIS trainee and trained with Seventeen.
* As mentioned above, MingMing participated on YG's \*MIXNINE\* and made it all the way to the finals, where he placed 10th in the competition, barely missing making it into the final group (which didn't debut anyway, but still).
* MingMing's most popular \*MIXNINE\* performances include 2PM's ""[My House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIRi1j5MZbM)"" and ""[Stand by Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AM1qf_vvDg)"" as part of Team 9reat!

The group also has various SNS pages, which can be viewed [here](http://kprofiles.com/blk-members-profile/).

[**D.I.P Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_dip_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 9, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is D.I.P?

D.I.P is a six member boy group signed to InterBD Entertainment. The group's name seems to be an abbreviation for the word ""**dip**lomat"".

The group debuted in November 2016 with the song ""[Fizz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIYm33ygc9g)"". From what I could find on the net, their most recent comeback was in September 2017 with the song ""[A Likely Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIYm33ygc9g)"".

I honestly wasn't able to find too much else about the group in English. Pretty much the only ""notable"" thing I could find is apparently members Seungho and B.Nish (Yubon) have been in a relationship for years? Though that can officially be classified as a rumor.

In any case, the group have many various SNS pages, which can be viewed [here](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/male_artist_profiles/d/d-i-p-profile/).

[**HINT Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hint_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 19, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is HINT?

HINT is a seven member girl group signed to Starpo Entertainment. The group was formerly known as Turan.

As Turan, the group debuted in July 2013 with the song ""Shotgun"" but I wasn't able to find the track on YouTube. Their most notable song as Turan was ""[Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGZ3wYw-60)"". After four years of promoting as Turan, the group redebuted as HINT in 2017 with a tweaked lineup. As HINT, the group's first single was called ""[Tang Tang Tang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In3-Jd6kYEg)"", which was released in April 2017. The group's most recent comeback was in January 2018 with the song ""[Walkie-Talkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apicwn8bmM)"".

I wasn't able to find too much else about the group in English, but the group does have various SNS pages (which can be viewed [here](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/female_artist_profiles/h/turan-profile/)).

Monika stayed with the group until this year, when she announced her decision to leave the group in March.

Monika's first album as a solo artist (and title song of the same name) ""[Will It Get Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-wBAKxFtp4)"" came about soon after she left Badkidz. This seems to be her most recent comeback.

Recently, when YG announced comeback plans for Winner/Ikon/Sechskies/Seungri in a press release, he said something along the lines of im sorry that we cant comment on Lee Hi at the moment (someone correct me if im remembering wrong). Considering that Seoulite wasnt even produced in-house but by HIGHGRND (which no longer exists btw), is it fair to assume that theres something going on behind the scenes? She had a song recorded w G.Soul to be released last September but here we are almost a year later and still nothing. 

I know YG hardly ever has his head on straight but Lee Hi always does well digitally and shes arguably the most skilled female vocalist in YGE. What could be the reason for YGE acknowledging Lee Hi but opting not to make comments about a possible comeback? Part of me thing Lee Hi might be refusing to release music (if thats even possible?) until her contract expires. Not to mention she got shipped off to Japan pretty soon after we got the comeback news last year. What do you guys thing is going on? ",1,0

1596,2018-6-20,2018,6,20,21,8si0z8,What is stage presence and is it skewed towards groups with fierce and freestyle concepts?,eL1xe,1529498913,"Over the past few days people have been mentioning stage presence a lot, example threads like [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8scd9c/what_groupssolo_artists_have_really_good_stage/). This might not deserve a thread of its own but I find myself confused as to what is stage presence. Before you read, this are all my opinions. Read them with an ""IMO"" in front of every sentence. I'm no expert, so help me out here.

It seems like when people list the best stage performers their performance consists of any combination of the following:

* Powerful or sexy choreo which contains huge body or leg movements, jumping and kicking

* Swag concept with raps - minimal choreo and vocals consist of talking or rapping to crowds instead of singing

* NOT be in part of a choreography formation with your group, instead walking to the crowds, waving your hands to hype the crowd

* Powerful vocals in ballad songs - don't need to do choreo for this, just fling your arms when you reach the high notes

* (Bonus) have tons of fangirls in the audience screaming to validate your stage presence

Is stage presence just = delivering a energetic + powerful performance / engaging with fans? Because that seems to be what I'm getting from reading a lot of the comments.

Without any of the above, can there be stage presence? Does concept affect stage presence? For me, with more powerful concepts you can make the crowd feel more.

An (extreme) example is let's make a perfect rated girl group with perfect vocals, they are dancing machines, they give their 100% performing to Orange Caramel's Shanghai Romance choreo and song. Now take a perfect rated boy group and they are giving their 100% performing BTS Fake Love. For myself it's clear the latter would blow the former out of the water, any perfect cutesy routine wouldn't captivate me as much.

Correct me if I'm wrong but for most comeback stages nowadays the groups just follow their routine to a T. So you don't really use the ""engage with fans"" tactic and thus your ""stage presence"" sucks, so in this case it all depends on your concept and how your performance is planned. For girl groups I see this a lot, they might be pretty up there and/or do something cute but it's not the same as a powerful performance. 

I love jamming to TWICE songs, but people like to shit on them for their stage presence. Well no shit, when they have none of the points listed in a typical bubblegum pop stage. I think they're the best at what they do but there's a limit to such concepts. Confidence which is always referenced with regards to stage presence, I think it is best shown in fierce/sexy/powerful concepts. If you have confident cute smile 24/7 in a cute concept it becomes creepy.

In a comeback stage to be aired on TV where you are supposed to just do your routine, can there be stage presence? For example, BP's new comeback has been claimed to lack stage presence. You can say they lacked energy hence lack stage presence, but I think not the other way round. I don't think any 105% amount of energy alone would make them above the ""normal expected stage presence level"" if the choreo itself is mid and they are just following it to a T.

I feel like most Kpop idol groups have no special stage presence, people over exaggerate. Concepts and choreography allow groups to have ""stage presence"". Engaging with fans during concert = ""wow stage presence"". Stage presence, like many other metric is only used in this subreddit to bring down others.

I hope to hear from people here about what is stage presence in regards to what I felt. Probably not a good idea naming the 3 biggest groups in my post..",17,3

I'm not talking about MVs where there are intended breaks for the plot, but MVs where the song is different from the studio ver. in terms of mixing/structure.

1. [AOA's Heart Attack ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pBgMBBsv4k)\- somehow the MV version sounds... messier and chunkier than the studio version. 
2. [Ladies Code's The Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsx9f8tdifw) \- the vocals in the MV version sound more... raw and bare? It gets really obvious in the chorus where Sojung's vocals and the accompanying harmonies seem to be in the forefront of the song as opposed to the studio version.
3. [Rainbow BLAXX's Cha Cha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKAi5cWHYDY) \- there is a significant difference in the MV version where the rap comes straight after the first chorus followed by an entire verse (2:00 - 2:25) which was completely removed from the studio version. I prefer the MV version way more.

Are there any other instances in KPOP where the MV version is different from the studio version? If so, which do you prefer? I'm not an expert in music/mixing so I don't know why there's this difference. ",43,71

With K-Pop becoming so popular nowadays, I'd like to create this thread in order to share playlists with each other! It'll help me and also you guys discover songs that we wouldn't be able to find.

I have 3 playlists that I'd like to share (feel free to follow them!) :

I didn't look at the NY ones at the time they came out, so I wasn't aware that not only has a Diamond tier been added, but now you have to buy engagement packs separately from the convention tickets just to have a chance with the scratch vouchers. $1700 for Diamond, $900 for Platinum--it's ridiculous, right? Or is this a regular thing with concert tickets outside of KCON? I've been to KCON LA 4 times, from 2013-2016, and while I understand that the event gets bigger and (supposedly) better each year, and that prices have been increasing every year, I feel like at this point it's almost theft. The issue is that as long as there are fans willing to pay that much, which is a given in this fandom, the prices will just continue to go up. I didn't go last year, but in the years I did go I didn't notice huge improvements in the management/organization.

Idk if there's really a point in me posting this lol, sorry if this is the wrong place. I'm just mad/frustrated. P3 is now the cheapest tickets, when there used to be P4 and P5. And then with that I'd still have to purchase a 3 day convention pass, no other option even if I only wanted to go 1 or 2 days, and it doesn't even come with the engagement opportunities anymore. It just feels so sad that KCON gets less and less affordable and accessible each year, especially for people who really want to go but don't have the means. I hope in the future the planners will listen at least a little, because these events can be so wonderful for bringing fans together.",42,31

So I went to Wanna One's first US stop in their first (and only?) World Tour, so I thought I would do a fan account so Wannables and/or casuals who go know what to generally except.

So before I get into the review of the show, here are some tips/things I noticed about things that likely will be carried over across all the stops.

**1)** **If you are VIP, camping out matters as you get let in number order. But since the show may or may not be sold out, you'll still have a lot of space and be close to the stage.**

So this happened with me in the San Jose stop. Even though there were like 600 VIP people, I showed up like at noon but didn't get in line until like 3:00PM (I was in the 400s) and STILL got a really good spot as the VIP sections were ginormous AND had two sides. While the lower level/balcony was packed, VIP and P1 definitely weren't. I was very surprised at how much space I had since the SJ VIP tickets sold out Day 1.

**2) There is only going to be three options for merch available. If you want something outside of the Undivided cd, a lightstick, or the Photo Essay, try getting it on eBay or a Korean site.**

Powerhouse really skimped on merch. Plus, if you want the cd, a lot of people were told it was still given out randomly unless you bought all six.

**3) The bag rule may or not be applied. It depends on who is running security.**

So purses, fanny packs, and small bags are good to go, but one dude was being hella weird about the smallish sports drawstring bags, saying like ""you may or may not be let in with that bag"". But when I got to the bag check to be let in, they were cool with it. Huge bags (like the big shoulder canvas bags) I would still err on the side of caution, but drawstring canvas bags/small backpacks and smaller are fine. But honestly, so many girls with those huge canvas bags were let in no problem.

**4) Soundcheck is super short. It's just three songs.**

Soundcheck was lax performances of ""I'll Remember You"", ""Wanna"", and ""Wanna Be"". It was funny (and nice) seeing the boys in ""non-idol"" mode in the sense where they wore pretty much sweatpants/exercise pants and hoodies. Daniel was the only one who was still ""fashionable"".

**5) You DO NOT get to stay in the building after soundcheck. You have to exit and re-enter the building a few hours later.**

Soundcheck was at 4:30PM, then security kicked us out and said come back at 6:30PM. So you can't save your spot.

**6) They were are strict as they could be when it came to recordings/photos. DO NOT bring DSLR cameras, YOU WILL BE REMOVED.**

4 fansites girls got kicked out for sneaking them in (1 girl got caught with like three songs before the show ended), and security was going up to people who had cell phones out and told them to put them away. No one who was recording/taking photos with a cell phone got kicked out, but I would still try to be slick about it.

**REVIEW OF SHOW**

So now onto the review of the show!

So first thing, if you'd like to see the setlist please click [here.](https://twitter.com/chamwink/status/1010038955134218241) The show is 2 hours and 45 minutes, so plan accordingly for rides and such.

As people who might have seen me post in Wanna One threads, I'm going to be honest, I'm a casual fan who likes the group more because I watched Broduce 101 rather than because of their music. Their music as WO has been very hit or miss for me, so I went to their concert with a kind of apathetic attitude about the whole thing.

Overall, I'd rate the show a 7/10. Not top tier amazing, but definitely better than I expected, especially given the limitations of the size of the venue.

**So positives:**

* The boys were really dynamic and really performed well. Maybe it was because this was their first stop but also because of the more ""intimate"" setting, but the boys really gave 110&amp;#37; percent.
* The setlist flowed really well, to the point I didn't even realize the concert was almost three hours.
* VIPs really get to see the boys up close. Like HELLA CLOSE.
* Pretty much all VCRs are dubbed or subbed in English, so for those who don't speak Korean, no worries.
* The translator was off-stage, and was translating pretty fast after the boys spoke.
* Daehwi spoke 99&amp;#37; of the time during the Ments because his fluency in English. Kaunlin spoke a bit, but it seemed he was a bit more hesitant in his English. Daniel's the third best at English. The rest just knew a few phrases here or there.
* They pretty much performed their entire discography. But I guess that happens when you only have three mini albums out.
* Everyone is inhumanly attractive. It's so unfair.
* Ong is such a dork - like 4D level. It was adorable and I can see why he's a hit on variety. Daehwi also has super natural aegyo in his voice when speaking English.

**Funny Bits/Cool Bits of Info:**

* The translator blanked on the world  (cherry blossom) in English &amp; called it beochggoch flower during Woojin's speech. Everyone kind of kept laughing and tried to yell loud enough for the translator to hear that it meant ""cherry blossom"".
* The translator, having to say English really fast after the Korean is said, accidentally said ""world war"" instead of ""world tour"" before fixing his mistake. Well, WO is part of K-pop WWIII with EXO and BTS so I mean...he's not wrong.
* He also messed up a bit with Daniel's end speech in a cute/funny way. Daniel was trying to say that Wannables make WO strong (or something along those lines) and trying to use the two parts of the fanname to emphasize the point. However, Daniel said the ""able"" part of Wannable like how it sounds like in Korean. So the translator, not quite picking up on where Daniel was going with things, was like ""Wanna"" and ""uhble"", to which Daniel quickly was like ""I meant ""able!"" able!"".
* A few members had close friends/family at this show. Kaunlin had some members of his family there, Daehwi had a close friend from when he was younger come, and Seungwoon had a very close friend (like Day 1 close) who currently lives in SF who came to concert as well. Seungwoon's story about his friend was super heartwarming, as he had told his friend before the friend moved that he would come see him in SF after he became famous...and he was so happy he made his promise come true.
* I've been listening to some fanmade remixes/mashups of ""[Burn It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vfSir0ycP0)"", ""[Energetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T25oSIpvsRc)"" and ""[Boomerang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhxPI7pmM_o)"" for so long that I got hella confused when I heard the group perform the official tracks.
* Coming from the same label aside, Jisung and Daniel are like hella close. Like that relationship definitely doesn't seem ""played up"" for the cameras.
* Jisung has DJ aspirations, and his DJ name is DJ Hangkki.
* Jihoon looks hella tiny (like Woozi tiny) next to the other members. Maybe it's because he wasn't standing next to Seongwoon (the actual shortest), but damn...I was shook by how short he looked. Also, most of the group looks much shorter in person.

**And now....the negatives:**

* The show really highlighted how uninspired so much of WO's group choreography is. As WJSN has shown, you can do a lot of cool formations and stuff with a large amount of members. WO's choreo just kind of feels samey, especially when seeing the songs back-to-back.
* If you're expecting to see a lot of the group perform together...well, you're going to be disappointed. Subunits and solo performances dominate a lot of the show. I'd say, to me, it felt like 60&amp;#37; subunit/solo stages and 40&amp;#37; group songs. Maybe even less in terms of group songs.
* So much of WO's discography is either slow ballads or slower tempo songs. It was hard to get ""lit"" (as the members wanted us to do) when so many of their songs were slow and not really ""lit"" material. Especially when they pretty much performed all their hype songs in the first 20 minutes.
* As much of I love Kuanlin (and his blonde hair), he was definitely ""lazy Sica"" status during the whole show. I don't know if it's because he's still uncomfortable with dancing, but it was very apparent that dancing isn't something he's naturally good at. It looked like he really had to think about the moves, but in doing so placed his moves so lazy-like. His solo stage was also a dance solo so I was like...""um, okay.""
* The group is still a bit stilted when it comes to Ments. It was pretty apparent a lot of them were reading from a teleprompter (in Korean, FYI) and so it made a lot of the ""fan pandering"" statements not come across more authentically.
* The puns. Oh god the puns. The group for some reason tried a lot to drop in their song titles in the ments or breaks in songs. Like ""oh that was *so beautiful,* you guys are so *energetic.""* I groaned.

**Overall Thoughts:**

So overall, I did enjoy the show. While not something I would say is up there of best K-pop shows ever, I do think they did the best with the material they had. Having music like theirs makes it difficult to have a good balance of hype and relaxed. But I am glad I went since I was total Broduce trash and seeing them up close for their own show (and not like at Kcon or something) is a novelty in itself since they are disbanding at the end of the year. I'm actually going to miss the boys being together even though I can't wait to see what they bring to the table once they are back at their home labels.

As I said above, I give the show a 7/10, though I think hardcore Wannables would probably bump that up to an 8/10 at minimum.",34,98

1902,2018-6-24,2018,6,24,4,8tcbbf,I'm surprised it took this long for Western entertainment to capitalize on having Kpop idols on shows,garfe,1529782180,"Lately I've been seeing a bunch of new interviews on Youtube for different kpop groups ranging from well known like EXO and NCT to newer acts like SF9 and Momoland I've actually been thinking this for a while and I've been noticing it with how it seems like I'm seeing a bunch of Kpop acts interview on the news and on Youtube interviews.  And while I know this feels like a rising flame from the spark that is BTS' American activities, does anyone else feel like this should have been happening way earlier?  In the West, you get bg and gg phases of maybe one or two interesting acts but in Korea, the groups never stop coming and with those groups, you get one fanbase tuning in after another and it just never stops.  I just feel like this is an angle that should have been realized and capitalized on earlier

I felt like it was way more organized than last year. The check in line was wild but thank God for the ""Toyota"" vip check in (heads up u can use any car key they don't care). The new GA lineup-queue system was also really nice, you didn't have to worry about missing out on other activities just to get a good spot. 

Also a really nice bonus this year was that there were way more opportunities to see idols. Asides the usual audience engagements which were BS luck, you could see them at the open air stage. Fromis 9 (who performs tomorrow) even made a guest appearance as announcers at a dance cover contest, it was awesome to see.

The concert itself today was awesome, longest one yet I'm pretty sure. Didn't know too much about stray kidz or pentagon going in (asides the great meme that is the shine dance) but I thoroughly enjoyed their energy and stage presence. The rappers for both groups really are top. Heize was what I expected, absolutely amazing. I got to go to the hi touch today for her and she's absolutely the sweetest. Sad she only did 3 songs but she nailed her performance, even though it's not nearly as high energy or visually oriented as the other groups and then choreography. Where was And July or Jenga tho??? Red Velvet was so lit. Nothing else really to say lmao, I did love their little ""wish roulette"" game though. Seeing them up close in the GA pit was great too, just wish they 1. Moved up more and 2. Did Russian roulette FML.

Making a new paragraph for SuJu because they were absolutely the best performers of the night. I went pretty much for heize and RV but suju blew it out of the water, their energy is amazing and the rock arrangements of BONAMANA and mr.simple were absolutely mental. Holy shit siwon looked like Usain bolt sprinting down the stage at each drop.

All in all, 9.98/10 concert (no .2 for lack of And July and Russian Roulette) 7/10 convention",25,77

Note: I will be using the topic titles found in the subreddit wiki META (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index). I will be using the desired effect: which section to edit form in this list. Ill also include some ideas for new sections

1. a general overview of music shows - edit the Music Show section

goals for editing:

 add an overview and explanation of the purpose of music shows

 add a guide about the various awards and the meaning of those awards

 add information that pertains the following topics: how do music shows work, how to vote, what does winning on a music show mean, how long do kpop singers/groups promote on these shows

2. promotion cycles guide: edit the Comebacks and Releases section

goals for editing:

 add explanation on how promotion cycles work

 add links to common idol variety shows

 provide the meanings of the following terms and the differences of these terms compared to related words: fan clubs, fan caf, fan meetings

3. Award show overview: edit the Award Shows and Concerts section

goals for editing:

 add explanations on what each award means and how significant it is

 add a special section about the Daesang award that explains what it is and why its important

4. information about k-pop generations: edit the Kpop History section

goals for editing:

 add descriptions for various kpop generations 

 add a list of musicians for every generation

 add relevant subreddit threads relating to thread

Bonus goals:

 add notable songs for every gen

 add a playlist of songs that belong to each generation (for example: a playlist containing first gen songs)

New sections to add to the subreddit:

1. A guide for being a responsible kpop fan on social media.

goals for editing: 

 add an explanation on why one must be a responsible fan on social media

 add general cyber safety tips

 add tips on how to avoid and how to stop fanwars

2. All-kills

goals for editing:

 add explanations for each type of all-kill and 

 add what goals need to be achieved for every type of all-kill

This is by no means a complete list. Id love to hear what you guys think should be done to the different subwiki sections in order to improve it.",3,20

This is inspired by /u/NudePenguins69 giveaways, I want to support my favorite singer but I don't collect photocards so instead of having a bunch of extra copies lying around this time I thought it would be nice to give it away to people who might not have bought a physical version of her album otherwise, maybe make a few people into bigger fans in the process ;) So PLEASE do not enter this giveaway if you have already bought/plan on buying the album anyway, it defeats the whole purpose. I know there's no way for me to properly check but please try to be decent person...

------

I'll be giving away **10** brand new unopened ""Something New"" albums for free shipped directly from the distributor to you. Winners will be drawn randomly.

**RULES:**

1. No new accounts, you have to be a fairly active member of /r/kpop (or /r/SNSD or /r/kimtaeyeon) and have made a few kpop related comments. I will check your profile for this to make sure you're not scamming. 

2. If you win I will need your name and address to send you the album, do not enter if you're unwilling to share that information. I will not share your private info with anyone but if you're under 18 you should still make sure you have your parents permission to give it out. 

**HOW TO ENTER:**

Just leave a comment answering these simple questions:

1. What is your favorite song on the ""Something New"" mini? 

2. What is your favorite Taeyeon MV? Any particular reason why?

Entries will close on Wednesday. Winners will be notifed by PM. ",136,108

Hi guys!!

I wanted to share my experience at the Pentagon meet and greet/photo op I got SO lucky to get during KCon NY! 

I got 2 A1 packages (aka 2 hi touches) hoping for Pentagon and Fromis.  I got 1 Fromis (yay!) but then a second Fromis and they were so unpopular/Pentagon was so popular I thought Id never get a Pentagon hi touch.

So I walked around hoping to find hi touch opportunities and noticed a sign about a meet and greet with Pentagon.  When I got there they were just giving out Heize hi touches but I came back shortly asking again about Pentagon and Kcon staff member at the Toyota deeply implied hed get me something.  Came back after the test drive, signed a photo waiver and a guy recorded me as I was given the meet and greet!!

I love all of Pentagon but I knew I needed to prioritize so I beelined straight for Kino (Im in the red shirt).  He saw me a coming and smiled and put his arm around me to greet me.  I then told him I was going to Seoul to study Korean in the fall so we could meet again (in Korean).  At this point, Jinho is peeking over probably curious about me speaking Korean).  One of my favorite photos Ill include is just a live photo (now video) of the end of our convo before we took pictures of Kino and I smiling then transitioning to take the pic.  So happy I get to see it played back in action!!

After we took the pictures I rushed to touch everyone elses hands.  Most noteworthy hand touch was definitely Edawn (who went for the hand squeeze when I went for a high five) and Yeo One who just seemed so genuinely happy to be there.  So my top 3 remains affirmed.  (Please see Edawns diverse facial expressions too!)  Unfortunately, Yanan had conflicts in his schedule!

It was so short but so sweet, Pentagon is the only boy group I stan but I stan em hard and getting to be that close to Kino was pretty amazing!!  I hope I can keep my promise to Kino (and see the others again) and meet him in my 2.5-5 months in Seoul.  

Thanks for reading :)",19,169

At the end, the girlfriend of the guy is dating another guy too, so she's also cheating on him. I guess the song was released between 2012-2014.

1. The obvious implication is that women shouldn't have a voice/opinion

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180625000524

the Big Bang front man, who is currently serving in the army, has been hospitalized in an Army Hospital in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, since June 19 suffering from ankle pain.

The problem is, according to the report, that the room he is using is a private first-class one specifically for colonels, inaccessible even to majors and lieutenants. His room is also equipped with an air conditioner, a TV and a fridge while rooms for other soldiers, usually for four, six, or eight people, are devoid of such facilities.

The report also pinpointed the flexibility of visiting hours applied to G-Dragons room. Normally, visitors can only visit from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the hospital, but it has been reported that someone who looks like the artists manager was spotted at his room after 5 p.m. He will be leaving the hospital on the 28th.

G-Dragons agency YG Entertainment hasnt released any official statement on the controversy, while the hospital also stated that theres nothing it can comment on the issue.",65,131

This past weekend I was at two of the three days for DAY6's Seoul concert. I did standing on Saturday with my friend Will (another fellow Brit and Jae fan) and seating by myself on Sunday because I knew I would not have the energy to do standing two days in a row.

This is overall my 6th time seeing DAY6 in concert since I moved to Korea and this superceeded the April EveryDAY6 weekender as the BEST concert that I have ever been to. The Olympic Hall venue is a great location to showcase their sound and ability (although there were a few mic issues from time to time where the music was louder than their voices) but overall the entire show was a blast. Why? Well:

1. Stage layout: The stage entirely surrounded the standing section and was right up to the edges of the seated so you were never really too far away from the members even if you were at the very back of the venue. They performed all around the stage, starting at the back to be close to the 2nd level seats and facing forward and backwards and even to the sides by performing on the walkways themselves. It meant that on Sunday I was incredibly close to Sungjin!

2. LED screens: Those who have never been to a DAY6 concert may not know this but they are a very visually artistic group in terms of what they had on their LEDs. At one point they were performing BEHIND the screens with various panels revealing individual members as they had their parts of the song (like for ""I Need Somebody""). It made for an amazing moment indeed.

3. The New Album: Guys. Guys. I am telling you. This new album is fire. I knew **Shoot Me** was going to be an anthem but I didn't realise *how good* it was going to be! It is fantastic live. Also, to put it mildly, everyone lost their ever-loving shit during **Warning**. Just look out for Young K's gravelly ad-libs. Feeling Good is a track made for driving too and a great summer jam!

4. Fanservice and Interaction: DAY6 are kings of interacting with their fans. During both days of the Encore (they probably did the same on Friday), all members came off the stage and started jamming with the audience both in standing and seating, even going all the way up to the second floor! I was so close to everybody but not close enough to get a high five on either day (not complaining, had high fives before from Jae, Sungjin and Wonpil at previous concerts). But it really did just feel like one massive party

5. Their love for MYDAYS: Every time, all members would give out outpouring thanks and thoughts of consideration towards all MYDAYS. Young K and Wonpil got quite emotional about it on the Saturday, Wonpil actually broke down for a moment during *You Were Beautiful* and again during his ending ment as he was talking about missing his family, which in turn caused Jae to cry (and Jae **never** cries at concerts, he is legit the only one who keeps it together). They are so thankful for those who stayed with them from the start and those who joined them along the way until now. Everyone was an emotional mess at the end of it!

6. Atmosphere: MYDAYs are some of the best fans out there. They are much older than your average K-Pop fan here in Korea and there is more of a male presence at shows then any other male group concert I have been to. Everyone is friendly and helpful and you are never really alone because people will talk to you to help or keep you company. I am adding in here there special guests - 15&amp;'s Jimin and 2PM's Wooyoung plus Nakjoon (Bernard Park) came on Sunday but on Saturday JYP himself was there! There was a mahoosive commotion about it and it was cool seeing him jam along to DAY6!

To summarise, this weekend was amazing and now I am a mess because I probably wont see them for a while because of their world tour. If they are stopping in your country or a location that is close to you, do try to make it because you will have one of the best times that you could in a live music environment! Also, support them with their comeback - I am telling you, **Shoot Me** really is the one!

Long story short, I fell in love with a song/video but I forgot to write down the song and band's name.

What I know:
- It seems to be a mix of male/female group. Not sure because the females are background dancers (They have no expression at all)
- Song is very upbeat
- The guitarist/singer has orangey, wavy hair
- Parts of the video was shot at a playground, there is a part where there is a playground carousel 
- Reminds me of hipster pop songs

Please note that this position will require more than just CSS and JS knowledge and we aren't necessarily looking to onboard someone that's brand new to all of this  we'd really appreciate applicants with a solid understanding of a strong majority of the position knowledge requirements.

Some of the things we use programming for:

* Writing the CSS (SCSS) for r/kpop, r/kpoppers, and r/kpophelp, as well as creating CSS widgets for new-reddit.
* Maintaining the bot that updates the sidebar with the current iChart Top 10
* Maintaining and improving u/Ko_Ko_Bot which interacts with Discord as well as Reddit to help us with moderation
* Maintaining and improving the scripts that we use to power This Week in KPOP
* Configuring Automoderator to handle things like our weekly features and automated moderation 
* Integrity protection around the annual census and awards to combat sajaegi

**Skillset required** to do the job:

* Experience with Python 2 and 3 (bots + scripts)
* Experience with CSS and NPM et. al. (Sub design) 
* Regular Expressions (Automod Configuration) 
* Experience working with external, web/HTTP APIs; such as the Discord and Reddit APIs (bots, scripts, census) 
* Independent work ethic and available free time; the ability to complete tasks in a reasonable timeframe and meet deadlines.

Skillset that would be great to have but can be learned: 

* Experience with PHP
* Experience with relational databases such as SQLite, MySQL, and/or PostgreSQL 
* Experience interacting with the Discord API 
* Experience interacting with the Reddit APIboth the OAuth2 API as well as the general REST API

This mod position will not be responsible for content moderation like approving threads, dealing with users, etc., although if you want to help out with that, you are certainly welcome.  We will be calling on you for everything from small tweaks to the CSS like adding something to sidebar, to creating new css widgets for the site redesign, to helping us fight vote manipulation in the annual awards, and lots of other stuff as outlined above.  If you think this sounds like a fun endeavour and you want to help make r/kpop a better subreddit, please click the link below to apply.

**Simply Kpop recording - Monday June 25th** 


I knew I wanted to go to a music show while I was there, and Simply Kpop was the easiest to go to. All I had to was keep an eye on the website notice board for an announcement with the recording date and then email with my details and wait. I got the email on Sunday saying to be there on Monday at 6.25pm. There was another recording earlier in the day that I didnt go to.


When I got there the fans who came with their fan club organised themselves in to lines, while the foreigners who got in via email just hung in a group while they checked our names off the list. A staff approached me and asked if I wanted to be interviewed by the MCs (The Boyz Kevin and Jacob), but Im quite shy and I always find those fan segments cringy so I said no.


The line up for the evening was Kangnam, A.C.E, The East Light, South Club, KHAN and NTB. I was pretty happy with that because I had heard of all of them minus NTB, and Im a fan of A.C.E. The noon recording only had one act who I knew of. Simply Kpop records all the performances for 3 weeks in 1 day, over the 2 recordings. That meant the shoot lasted until 11pm and some of the groups performed, went away, and then came back later in different outfits for and filmed again as if it was a different week! 


The East Light went first and were just filming for one show, but were asked to do 2 takes. The only thing I knew about them was little Woojin from P101 S2 is in there, and turns out hes not so little anymore! Their song was super cute.


South Club was next - Nam Taehyuns band. They recorded for 3 different weeks and did a couple of do-overs, so by the end of the night I was a bit sick of their song. Nam Taehyun is a bit crazy on stage - sometimes he stands still and stares down the camera and sings but other times he jumps around and spins and lunges, he did the splits in the last take. It was a bit of culture shock when youre used to the ultra refined Kpop choreography, but Im happy he is pursuing the music style that he wants :)


KHAN is Yuna Kim and one of her bandmates from The Ark (sorry I dont know her name). They were both great at performing live. The recorded for 2 weeks shows.


Didnt Kangnam use to be in a hip hop group? They put up this HUGE disco ball and he came out and sang a trot song! He didnt have a fan club there but he was super sociable with the audience. He recorded for 2 shows and when he came out the second time he greeted the audience again, and then was like wait arent you the same people as before? He was also surprised that the audience is recycled haha


I hadnt heard of NTB before signing up for the recording so I googled them, and one of the top results was NTB Kpop assault. Not reassuring. Turns out 2 of the members were the guys from Pure Boys who beat up their band mate Lee Seokyu (from P101 S2). The rest of the members were not in Pure Boys. Their song was alright and one of the members caught my eye, but I cant be a fan of the group with those two guys :/


A.C.E was my highlight as Im a fan of them and I had just gone to their fan sign a few days earlier (below). I was really annoyed because me and some of the other foreigners who werent doing the MC interviews went in first and sat on the right side of the stage, but the Choice group sat on the left with all their banners so all the interactions were aimed at that side. But its fine because I was really close to the stage and they walked past our side every time they entered and exited. A.C.E recorded for 3 shows and did one do-over, so I happily watched Take Me Higher 4 times! But if youve seen their performance youll know their dance is very intense, so they must have been exhausted at the end of it. I was trying my best to join in the fan chants, but since I was sitting with fans of The East Light and KHAN I was the only one on our side doing it and it was really awkward.


All of these performances were interspersed with Kevin and Jacob coming out and recording a shows worth of MC segments. I think theyre still getting used to the job but they did well. The foreigner segments were surprisingly not that cringy. The staff got the audience members to switch seats when a different weeks MC was filmed to make it look like a different audience. That caused a problem when The East Light fans were on screen with their banners and the staff went wait The East Light isnt on today! and started swapping them for The Boyz and A.C.E banners!


Overall it was a great experience. Very long and I had a sore neck by the end, but definitely worth it just to get the music show experience, even if it is different from Inkigayo, Music Core etc. If you want to experience a music show but your bias group isnt promoting while youre in Korea, I think Simply Kpop is a good option because its easy to go to without being affiliated to a particular fan club.


**A.C.E fan sign - Saturday June 23rd**


Fans could enter the lottery for the fan sign by buying their CD from a particular store between Wednesday and Friday. I went in on the Friday and signed up. The process itself was easy, the staff gave me a little form to fill in my name, email and phone and how many CDs of each version I wanted. Then I handed in in, paid and they gave me the CDs. The hard part was deciding how many CDs to buy to have a good chance of getting in, but not overdoing it, especially since I have to take them back with me overseas. A.C.E are popular enough to have a fan sign lottery (as opposed to first come first served) but are still pretty nugu, so I settled on 4 CDs, 2 of each type. I feel a bit strange owning multiple of the same CD since Ive never done that before, but the fan sign was so worth it!


When I arrived I had to bring my ID, copy of the form and my CD to be signed. I swapped my form for a seat number - 48/100. Out of the list of 100, I counted abut 30 names that werent Korean which was a lot more than I expected.


The fan sign was much more subdued than a concert. The boys entered from the back of the auditorium and walked down the stairs to the stage, and there was no screaming like you get at KCon or something, just a lot of wows and photo snapping. Pretty much everyone was using a big fancy camera.


The order was Donghun - Jun - Wow - Byeongkwan. I was quite overwhelmed when I sat down to get the first autograph, which wasnt helped by not speaking Korean. I can understand bits and pieces, but I cant make grammatical sentences. Donghun asked if I dont speak any Korean and I said yes, only things like hello and thank you, and we spent the rest of the time kind of awkwardly high fiving haha. He has really sweet looking eyes.


My bias Jun was next. My gosh he is so handsome. He spoke a mix of English and Korean. He asked me where I was from and said I had travelled a long way, and I gave him a souvenir from my country - which I bought on the off chance I would go to a fan sign!


Wow was quite quiet which didnt surprise me. He spoke to me in Korean and I answered in English and it worked fine. You know how fans bring along hats and toys and stuff for the members to wear during the fan sign? They all got a lot but for some reason Wow always got these really weird and funny hats, like this roast chicken that you wear on your head and the legs wiggle and plays a song. It was bizarre :)


Byeongkwan spoke English to me and I asked him to teach me some Korean slang. Im not sure of the spelling but it was Se-Jel-Kwi? or something? It meant the cutest in the world. Byeongkwans engagement with the audience was great, he was always posing for photos and waving and stuff.


The manager who was supervising behind them was very helpful, he spoke english would pop in and see that we were communicating alright :)


One thing that surprised me was how much makeup they wear. Its no secret that both the girls and guys wear make up, and it look great on camera and from afar, but up close they are so shimmery! Still amazing as usual, just very shimmery!


At they end the did a seat number raffle, and the winners would give their phone to the members and they would take a selfie with it. Afterward Jun and Wow performed Black and Blue and then all 4 ended with Take Me Higher. Their dance is so in synch, they are top notch. 


If you get the chance, fan signs are a lot of fun and its amazing getting the chance to be up close with the members and talk to them. You do have to weigh up the how many CDs is enough to get in but not wasting my money dilemma.",5,77

2221,2018-6-27,2018,6,27,1,8u1azg,"We kpop fans need to be united, not fighting",kpopforeva,1530029736,"Hi everyone, I wanted to write this since a couple of weeks, finally, I have time to relax and write (or at least, Ill try) all my thoughts.

I am 30 years old right now and I have been a kpop fan since 2010.

Being a fan of Kpop before wasnt easy:

* they all look the same
* guys has too much makeup
* why you like this if you dont understand what it says

Now, it seems that is the trend, so everyone is curious.

It wasnt that easy get fancams, idols didnt have twitter/Instagram, you had eng sub just for the popular groups, etc etc etc.

So, right now, Kpop fans almost have it all, and meanwhile Kpop could be in one of its best times ever, people keep hating on pointless things.

One of the reason could be the amount of information we get, and for me, this info makes the people even more competitive

Youtube views, digital charts, album sellings, tv show wins

Pak? I mean, I started hearing about pak right now, but people seem to be all over it now.

What Im trying to say is that just be thankful for what you got, and enjoy new releases, comebacks, etc, remember that we are all a community, and another artist or group success is not equal to the failure of your favorites.

A bit of rivalry is always fun, but there is a limit. (note: I dont know if Im using rivalry right)

And I know some things seem unfair, sometimes you feel like a group deserves way more, but this is like everything and unfortunately luck has a really important role here. 

I would like to write more, but I feel like that maybe If I do that youll get bored about what is this auntie saying lol, so that\`s it \^\^

**TL;DR: Kpop is such a fun world, be happy!**",224,1325

How big is the pit area? How many hours before the concert did you start lining up?

In addition, has anyone been to any music shows in Korea? Are there any special requirements to get a ticket (ex: purchasing something, being a member of the fanclub, etc.)? I have done some research and I know that for some shows such as pre-recordings, you need to buy the artist's album to enter. But I would like to hear from someone who has actually been to on before as a foreigner!

Thanks!",2,1

Been a few days already but I felt like sharing my experience.

As the title suggests, I was one of the people during Heize's artist engagement to get a Polaroid after successfully flipping a water bottle within 60 seconds. The turn of events that allowed this miracle to occur was quite fortunate: I didn't have an engagement pass for Heize initially, but after submitting a picture for the Bibigo stall I won 5 passes which allowed not only myself, but all of my friends that came with me to attend the event (having friends with me really boosted my confidence in the next part of my anecdote). Afterwards, during the event, the method with which they chose fans to come up on stage was through a shirt color that Heize herself chose (clearly blue as proven by my shirt color) and even then I had to jump up, admittedly like a gorilla, to attract the attention of the host choosing the fans (thankfully most people near me were amused by my enthusiasm so they started to point at me).

Seeing her up close I was surprised to say she looks exactly the same in person and perhaps even shinier than in music videos or album covers (she was so shiny!). In addition, I went to the concert for Saturday only, and I have to say that Heize is probably the best singer I've heard in my entire life, comments on her live performances that I've watched on Youtube usually describe it as, ""She ate the CD"", but I would have to say she swallowed her songs and turned them into audible diamonds whilst she was performing. It was actually frightening to think that someone has the whole package and regularly out sings her recordings. She must have some kind of penchant for voice alchemy because hearing that angel sing live allows you to really hear just why her music genre is considered ""soul"".

Overall for my first K-CON the experience was amazing, the turnout was so immense and the enthusiasm portrayed by all the fans was overwhelming. I've been to a few raves but the noise of the crowd cheering for their favorite groups easily outdoes any bass drop I've ever experienced. In addition I finally got to see my childhood favorite boy's group: Super Junior and my favorite group of all time: Red Velvet. A lot of people I know talk about how the reality of meeting your favorite idol or celebrity kind of wanes down on your expectations but seeing all the groups and performers, especially Heize and Red Velvet have only strengthened my resolve to go to more live events because they are even more impressive and astonishing in person. I didn't think I could become an even bigger fan. Ever since that amazing Saturday I've been counting my blessings because with how lucky I was I wouldn't be surprised if I was struck by lightning and then eaten by a flying shark.

On a side note: I know I'm wearing a Red Velvet T-Shirt, but it's because they're my favorite group. Talking about solo singers though, Heize is definitely at the top and honestly I hope I didn't offend in her anyway.

My apologies for any under or over enthusiasm, this is my first post in this subreddit.",23,92

1.

In every line evolution video, it's a lot about Jeongyeon never being treated fairly by jyp and getting very little lines.

They always say she has the most stable voice. That I don't agree with. I personally love her voice, it's very smooth and creates excellent contrast being a bit deeper than nayeon and jihyos. And she can modify it to suit the theme of the song (compare her in cheer up and signal for example).

But she can't keep it stable for a long time or while dancing, and jyp probably gives her less lines despite being a lead vocal is because despite having a good voice she can't sing for a long duration without it cracking. Youll notice this in every live performance that nayeon and jihyo do have a more stable voice. Twice is still a rookie group and it's just kinda silly that fans think they know more than creator of the group of whose strengths and weaknesses is.

2.

The thrice boogeyman. I kinda feel like onces have made a boogeyman of ""thrice"" even if they aren't there. For example their Gee performance wasn't very strong and they sounded shaky, it's fine they were a new group and have come a long way since then. But apparently anyone who disliked the video or said they didn't sound good just had to be part of ""thrice"". ",347,142

I'm not counting English for this because I have noticed that seems quite common in kpop bands both with and without foreign members.

 I haven't really been in the kpop community for long ~5 months, and I haven't come across anything. I'm also trying to gage the Korean  community, and other k idols, general response and treatment towards foreign idols (also if anyone can tell me about certain expectations, rules for foreign idols that differ from other k idols, I'd be grateful). For example (and I feel bad for comparing this to western pop but I really don't have much else to go on) often in pop songs, stars might sing a verse in their native tongue (see: pitbull talking about his Cuban roots in multiple raps, singing in spanish, etc.), as a sign of national pride. 

Would this type of thing be acceptable in kpop? Would artists doing this face allegations of ,""she's not Korean enough"" ""he should go home if he wants to sing like that"" etc. ",17,13

Not only do they have overly cute personalities (which often seem a bit too overexaggerated), but their personalities also clash with the image that they show in their music video, which I think would turn the American audience off. 

Twice doesn't have a designated English speaker (Mina does speak some English, but mostly her pronunciation is good rather than her vocabulary. Those who have met Twice at fansigns often say that both Nayeon and Jihyo speak better English) and I also think that their music would be far too cute for the American audience. 

Red Velvet does have a designated English speaker, but Wendy's English is really..lacking? At the end of this interview, what she says doesn't make any sense (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdN3bCPw7IU). Their music could probably appeal to the international audience since it's so varied but without anyone who speaks English the interest would probably be lacking. ",4,0

ARTIST - SONG

&amp;nbsp;

Hello again, fellow nerds, and welcome back to r/kpop sings! After a looong time in the dungeon working on our 2nd mini album, [Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAqamoiej1U), we've finally nailed down a work flow and process and are ready to start cranking out the jams. We've decided on a couple of new best practices; those and the FAQ are laid out below! Get nominating!

&amp;nbsp;

THE THEME FOR r/KPOP SINGS 3rd DIGITAL SINGLE IS:
#~The Song of Summer ~
(This round of r/kpop sings will be limited to ***female groups/soloists.***)

&amp;nbsp;

Nominate your favorite summer bops/jams/bangers! Eligible songs are ones that are upbeat, fresh, fun and were released in or became massively popular during the summer by a female kpop singer or group! I'm not going to give you an example of a summer song, as that could look like I'm influencing yall, but I will say that a good example of the complete OPPOSITE of what we're looking for is EXO's *Miracles in December.* Basically, don't be dumb, use your brain, you know what a summer song is.

&amp;nbsp;

New features for r/kpop sings round 3:

1. **Themes!!** This is to help keep me from going crazy and to limit the number of nominations to something more manageable. The editorial team has compiled a massive list of themes and will choose one for each release. If you have suggestions, throw them in the comments, but I promise you we already have ""girl crush"" written down.

2. **REQUIRED Instrumentals**. Part of the reason we're limiting the number of nominations is so it'll be easier for us to go through the list and make sure a **useable and high quality instrumental is available.** This is part of why Wolf took so damn long, we were even considering manually recreating the backing track at one point. We honestly should have just admitted defeat and done 2nd place instead, but SOMEONE is a stubborn asshole (it is I) and *insisted* we rise to the challenge of the meme. So once we have the nomination list, we will go through and eliminate any songs without instrumentals before the final list is presented for voting.

3. **Male/Female Alternation**. We're going to try to keep the pattern we've (totally intentionally) established going forward and limit nominations to either boy or girl groups/singers on alternating tracks.

4. **Scheduling**. So we kinda ate shit on the scheduling for Wolf for a bazillion reasons, mostly because when it came down to it, people are people and people get busy. This time, we're not going to try to slap any dates on things. Things will happen when they happen and we'll all just have to trust that they're happening.

&amp;nbsp;

#General FAQ

**Q: What the heck is this? What are yall on about?**

A: This is r/kpop sings! It is a community project inspired by the super successful [r/anime sings project](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/sings). The community nominates, votes for, and then records themselves singing a kpop song of their choice, which is then edited and released by the r/kpop sings team. Anyone can nominate and vote, and everyone is encouraged to sing.  Check out our previous songs on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ), and follow our [tweeter for updates](https://twitter.com/redditSingsKpop).

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Can I still nominate a song if I don't plan on singing?**

A: Heck yes you can. This is a community project; anyone and everyone can nominate and vote on songs, and ANYONE CAN SING! Even if you don't plan on singing, you still get a say in what WE sing, so nominate whatever you think we'll be awesome at (or terrible at!! up to you!!)

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: How many songs can I nominate?**

A: Go crazy, son. Nominate as many as you like, as long as they're on theme.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Q: Who decides if a song is on theme?**

A: We do. If you think we've somehow made an egregious mistake by discounting your submission, feel free to bring it up, but we'll probably ignore you.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Q: Can I be a part of the singing????**

A: Yes. See above, be patient :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: When will this form close?**

A: Nominations will close FRIDAY July 6th at MIDNIGHT CST (or around there, roughly. I'm human.) Voting will probably begin within a week of that date, depending on number of submissions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: Who is running this project?**

A: /u/illlllllli passed the administration reigns to me after the first project and we've slimmed down the contributing team after getting our workflow organized. We'll be tweeting our profiles eventually, and I'll let the members own up to which is them if they want.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: What can I do to help?**

A: Name the ~fandom~!  Post your suggestions below, tweet us or DM me. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: I have another question not covered here!**

A: Hit up my DMs.





&amp;nbsp;
