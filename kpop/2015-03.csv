Links in question are ~~Berry Good~~, ~~Rubber Soul~~, &amp; Zion.T&amp;Crush. I'll update as soon as SBS uploads their videos if they ever do.***

These are all some of the better fancams I could find from the concert last night. Some of their older tracks that they've performed a lot before were difficult to find vids of so most of these are of their new tracks, VCRs, and newly choreographed songs. Most of the links are to instagram, youtube, tumblr, soundcloud, and meipai and the fans were CRAZY loud so you'll probably want to turn down your volume before you watch them. This obviously isn't everyhing from the concert and there are new fancams coming out every minute so everyone feel free to post any videos and pics that you find! Also, my skills in formatting are obviously lacking, so this won't be pretty but hopeful it's still navigable.

Also something important that happened, Kai apparently fell off the stage and injured his wrist. He wasn't able to perform Mama and I'm not sure if he performed in the encores or not. From what I've heard, him and Tao were taken to the hospital after the concert ended as Tao's ankle had been injured a couple of weeks ago and I'm guessing he hurt it again from the strain of dancing.

EDIT: [here is Kai falling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yoq82uVc0)



I haven't even seen the whole thing, but I can say that this is definitely 10x better than The Live Planet. The song choices, the choreo, the VCRs, just everything about it went so much smoother than TLP went. Not to mention, THEY ACTUALLY SANG LIVE!! And on the very first day too, it's a true miracle really. All of the new songs sound fantastic too, especially El Dorado and I am so pumped for this album I can't even wait! I'm really just so excited at this point I don't even know what to say. But anyways, I hope this post helped you all out!

So 4minute's new mini is my latest obsession (The whole album is so hype), and in my endless quest to be obsessed, I've been trolling the interwebs looking for live performances. A few of them were probably a bit staged as opposed to actually live (unless they can spawn the bucket hats on their head spontaneously, anyway), but I really liked the full dance.

But when I was watching, I noticed a recurring pattern, in that toward the end of every song Gayoon looks like she's about to die. It's not a secret she has problems with some of the dancing since it makes her feet hurt really bad, but this latest song it seems more obvious, and I can't help but admire that dedication to keeping up with the others. They could (and it's probably been suggested by someone, whether a choreographer or inven or even here) just not make her dance and instead make her some sort of center, but instead Gayoon plows through it. The girl's going to collapse on stage on day because of it, I think, but she's gonna keep up with it.

To me, in a way, that's amazing. She's not going to hold back any more than necessary, even if you can tell just from looking at her expression when the mask slips that it's nearly killing her to dance at all sometimes, even with the little bits they can get away with not making her do (the kicks in Crazy, for example).

I could go on about the unfair practices of the K-Pop music industry, but that's been done to death. Instead what I want to talk about is the fact I know she's not the only one to go through something like this. Instead, I want to talk about, not just Gayoon, but other boys and girls in the industry that might have some sort of problem that they don't let hold them back. Since I'm fairly new to this whole K-Pop thing (I'm really trying to reconnect with my culture, and my readings and talking to my mom eventually led me to K-Pop), all I really know about is the ""overworked and fainting"" thing that you see occasionally.",51,44

342,2015-3-10,2015,3,10,10,2yialw,Understanding the fallacy of netizen comment websites,BoraFan,1425949465,"This may seem like common sense to some, but I think its worth making a point of considering Im sure a large proportion of the community here browses sites such as NetizenBuzz [although there are others]. Additionally I often see some people confused as to why netizens think a certain way about a topic, or using such sites as a basis of public opinion. And hey, I'm sure there are some new users who I might be able to inform with such a post.

To be clear; the sites I am discussing take comments posted on large Korean news sites like Naver, Daum, Nate, etc. by Korean netizens, translate them, and post them up with their comment score for international fans to critique, analyse or do what they will with them. Certain sites have even built up a community essentially revolving around discussing and scrutinising these translations. As long as discussion is civil there is I guess nothing inherently wrong with this; but there are a few core problems with this type of site that you should note when reading the opinions they present:

1.	These netizen comments are almost always cherry picked for drama and dont actually represent the range of popular opinion for any given topic: sifting through simple one-line praise across every article gets boring fairly fast, so obviously these comments are going to be excluded. Specifically comments which present harsh criticism or a seemingly controversial opinion will tend to be translated.

2.	From a more macro-centric viewpoint, the opinions of netizens in general arent necessarily aligned with those of the general public. Bear in mind if you are going to comment and closely follow the K-Pop or celebrity scene in Korea you are likely quite invested in it all and thus are likely to feel more strongly about certain events than your average Joe. To add to this; certain articles are going to attract a certain audience  sometimes you will see so-called antis swarming an article and down voting opposing opinions.

3.	This is my opinion  and you are certainly permitted to disagree  but I think building a community purely around reacting to the controversial opinions translated by one person from certain articles on the web is a little unhealthy. 

Often you will find yourself bottlenecking your viewpoint of a topic or even the Korean public at the mercy of one person/group and what they choose to translate - and because the dialogue around a given article is almost always focused on the netizen comments themselves  you arent really forming any new opinions or thinking independently about that topic. 

At the very least, I think its worth saying that you shouldnt get too invested in netizen comments and take them very much with a pinch of salt  whether you choose to engage with the sites or not. They actually come in pretty handy if you are after translated headlines and a little info about ongoing events.

The first two points are already made clear in places like the [NetizenBuzz FAQ]( http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.uk/p/are-these-netizen-comments.html), but obviously not everyone is going to read that or even necessarily be aware of its existence. Im not blaming any site either, rather just trying to help people who frequent [or plan to frequent] such places go in with an open mind and not necessarily take opinions there as gospel.



**TL;DR: For the reasons presented above, it's worth taking netizen opinion sites with a pinch of salt and realising they offer up a very much skewed sample of 'popular' opinion.**",42,123

if i remember rightly, the dance version only had ~15k views on youtube and i doubt the story version had that much more. The quality of the mvs seemed oddly high.

again, this isn't a ""top tier"" or even ""middle tier"" girl group, i hadn't heard of them and I've been listening to kpop for ~4-5 years.

Our teacher told us to get any kind of music and edit our trailers to the beat of the music. I pulled out my USB and downloaded dupstep/pop music to my computer. Right before I put my USB away a kid asked if he could borrow my USB to ""transfer"" his music from his friends computer to his. After he was finished he gave me back the USB.  The next day everyone was suppose to show their trailers and present it in front of the class. After about 30 minutes, the kid that borrowed my USB goes to present his trailer. As soon I heard the intro, I realized that the kid used a kpop song from my USB. Turns out he needed music desperately and just went through my USB looking for music to use in his own video.  So basically when the trailer was playing I was getting goose bumps everywhere. I thought people in the class would say the music sucks but no one complained or said anything bad. Some people were even interested by it. After class ends I hear a few people talk about the music and they find out its kpop. I was too shy to say anything about it. Later during lunch, as I pass by a group I hear the same music playing on someone's phone. I guess I introduced kpop to people accidentally. 

Sorry if the post was long, it was something funny that happened during school. The music the boy in my class used was by EXO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssLzlYK_jlE

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for the reply! I'll try my best to talk to my class mates about kpop. Maybe even have the whole school hear some kpop songs!",29,77

438,2015-3-12,2015,3,12,12,2yrblp,Rainbow ends 'Black Swan' promotions after two weeks.,aornic,1426132051,"DSP Media has officially announced today that after a 2 week promotion Rainbows Black Swan promotion has come to a end. This comes as no surprise as word has been floating around all week that this would be their last week. Rainbow has not been appearing on music shows, radio and they recently had their Meet &amp; Greet (Rainbow usually does international fan events at end of their promotions) all 3 things were strong signs that it was going to end soon. 

Rainbow was originally going to promote The Bad Man Cries with Black Swan (it would have been their Golden Touch with Tell me Tell me), but plans changed and so they only performed it on radio and released a choreography video.

It is believed that Woo Ris commitment to Flower of the Queen has been clashing too much with Rainbows schedule that it became hard for Rainbow to continue promoting and performing. Seung A was also connected to a film that is going to start shooting this month, but we are not sure if shes still attached to it or not as that was reported back in January.

This remix of [""Everybody"" by Xulikken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGUzpfXNAds) is so dreamy and incredible.  In fact, I recommend all of Xulikken's remixes.

Also, from what we've heard from the audio teaser, the ""[I scream you scream](https://soundcloud.com/adrian-lara-38/audio-teaser-1)"" part matches as well.

I'm psyched!

Update: The [video teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5PE8Jz6doo). At this point I'd be SHOCKED if it wasn't a vampire concept.

If you disagree, please explain me!",[deleted],1426306275,"Can't say about pre-2013, because i didn't follow it closely before that. Since then, i've been following many weekly charts and keeping up with the new albums-MV (thank you guise). 

I don't know guys, i just watch-listen to every thing popping up and none of them really catch my attention, none of them glue to my memory, none of them make me put the same song 30 times in a row... Besides 'Up and Down', i just don't see any 'SUPER SONG', those that will be in history, that the fans will always remember...

And then i go back to my 2013-14 top50-100 songs and there are so many of memorable songs... 'Overdose', 'Meaning of You', 'Some', 'Swing', 'Something', 'Missing You', 'Just one day', 'War of Hormones', 'Shower Later' many more... Yes i like all kind of groups and artists being them femalegroups, boybands, solo, ballads, dancy, Crayon pop (they have their own genre) and etc... Just in a few seconds i remember all the amazing songs in 2014 that got in my mind in a way that none of the '15 songs managed to get. I try to listen songs of top10-50-100 charts over and over and it all seems just so meaningless...

OF COURSE, that's just me. This is a post to both create more discussion and also to people prove me i'm wrong (if i am indeed). 

Also, if you disagree, feel free to post some songs that you think that will be listened even 1 or 5 years from now.

edit* Wow, downvotes? i really really expected much more from this sub.

edit*2 Seems like most people misunderstood this thread and what i'm trying to say, level of discussion and arguments in this subbed dropped significantly, that's sad, much more people trying to proove others wrong with shitty arguments than actually content.

Especially they say in the comment box like are you having a seizure,is this girl mental,you can't dance. It hurts so much because I can dance. I used to be a gymnast and yes I did had a bad back injury that made me a bit stiff. But,I do stretch my muscles everyday before I practice a new dance cover. And now I feel like the more of them subscribe onto my channel the more they will make fun of me. Please support my page and im just trying in my dance cover videos. Even know how shy I was in the beginning of my videos at least im improving by every new video. So,please support me. :) ",31,0

586,2015-3-16,2015,3,16,11,2z6y3a,Unpretty rapster ep6 my opinion,ihyunah,1426474142,"Hey im a huge fan of this show but as it goes further i see some ratchet skunks there. I never seen any video of aoa not even now but my favorites in this show are Jimin, Kisum, Tymee and chetah until ep5 end. She wanted to diss jimin and that jimin would suffer from it, okay.

1 point i wanted to discuss on is Producers Biasing jimin . it isnt true due to;
1: producers comes from rap industry . right? Dont think they re fans of aoa
2: reactions are different due to her looks if you compatr cheetah and jimin jimin looks like a very innocent girl so the expectations arent that great but when she starts it changes. 

Anyway some other points 

1: Jimin is being considered as an idol but why isnt jessi??? Jimin can rap good but she will be bashed by the antis cause when she wins it is due to her idol status but when looses its due to her being a bad rapper. Shes allso tuff as an idol cause dont think others would standby so calm while being dissed 

2:Jessi been in musik industry over 10 years now even recently she re-debuted at lucky J . why isnt she considered as an idol? Shes thinking of herself like a producer whos opinion should be always put infront.also i stopped like chetah in ep6 when she lostvto jimin and ever since she looks like she'd kill jimin and the time when kisum joined jimin she felt betrayed lol. 
 Overall i believe jessi is lil afraid cause kisum and jimin has normal chances of winning, believe it or not . but jimin does rap well enough comparing to rappers here i would place her as in 4th place. 1 yuk yidam 2 chetah 3 tymee and then jimin. 
3: my other fact about jessi is she uses english to make the rap easier and yeah i agree with kisum 99% of the words she says in english neither 1 of them besides jolly understands. Adding english sentences makes rapping easier but it isnt an english competition tough. And why does yuk yidam like jessi so much i mean shes getting like a second jessi.

1 Jolly V,, 2 chetah or jessi these should leave jolly raps very bad and has no energy at rapping and if chetah or jessi would get eliminated the one whos leftvshould calm herself down and look more equal to others as chetah showed in 1on1 that she shinks jimin isnt on her league. Thats the reason for her loose.

Lastly i would love season 2 of PRETTY RAPSTERS where only idols would compete JUST NO CL PLEASE blackjackd would kill the other fans xD
Idols like yubin hyuna(calm me stupid but her rap song just follow feat zico slays)
Wanted to ask ur opinions towards it
Regards

769,2015-3-19,2015,3,19,19,2zklht,[Album Discussion/Review] MFBTY - Wondaland,BoraFan,1426761150,"Hey guys, I wanted to do an album discussion for this record to get everyone's opinion on the album in general. To get the ball rolling a wrote a [semi]short opinion piece of my thoughts on the record:

__________

*Wondaland* is something of a change of plan for veteran hip hop act MFBTY. The carefree vibe almost every track exhibits, and the upbeat tone of the record in general stresses that this is certainly them kicking back, taking a break from the almost engrained sobriety of mainstream hip hop and just writing music they enjoy. Listeners will need no more convincing of this than their son Jordans feature with the cute little skit *Dance Yes Yes Yall Dance*; this is very much a family record and the chemistry between all participants is clear from the offset. Drunken Tiger fans will recognise this style as very much apparent with *The Cure* EP, and that record certainly demonstrated the trios strength in this regard. By removing the constraints of labelling the record as strictly a hip hop ensemble, Bizzy, Mi Rae and Tiger have produced an album with remarkable breadth in content and message, if perhaps absconding slightly from their characteristic approach to music.

Whilst this is by no means a bad thing; it may leave a sour taste in some fans mouths whom might prefer the more traditional hip hop/R&amp;B focus the three have had when they have collaborated in the past. There are certainly glimpses of this style; *Hello Happy* teases at classic Mi Rae-Tiger swagger but never fully commits, preferring instead to incorporate a modern pop style. *Rebel Music* perhaps comes closest to reliving the past but is still very much a modern piece compositionally; juxtaposing a conventional hip hop beat with a simplistic yet effective guitar piece and  strangely - gaming soundbites, an amalgamation that Mi Rae, Bizzy and Tiger have no problem asserting dominance over with a series of impactful verses and a great off-the-cuff vocal piece from Mi Rae which gives a very American feel to the track.

Songs like *Let it Go* are very much a la *Sweet Dream*; highlighting the sheer versatility of Mi Raes vocal pieces in appropriating any beat and really impacting an instrumental. Its difficult to deny the trio deliver songs like *Let it Go* and *Half Time* to great effect, equally their more balladic-orientated pieces such as *Love and Peace* and *Hello Happy* are given vibrance and impetus by Mi Raes soulful vocal line, imbuing real emotion to Tiger and Bizzys bars. Indeed, as is perhaps to be expected, the pop-focused sound of *Wondaland* very much centres on Mi Raes contributions both vocally and in a rap capacity  this is certainly great news for fans but those wanting Bizzy or Tiger centrepieces may be left feeling lacking. Perhaps the only criticism of a record which is very much both new and old ground for the group is that those interested in a more old-school DT vibe arent catered for. 

The [albeit dated] essence and heart of previous collaborative efforts such as *I Hate Myself* is nowhere to be found  that could prove a dealbreaker for some. Whilst the more modern sound of *Wondaland* could definitely prove divisive, it is undeniable that the album as a whole is very much a showcase of Tiger, Bizzy and Mi Raes ability to command respect in any genre they deign to visit; compounded by the sea of apt, high profile collaborations the record brings  be it the youthful vivacity of Rap Monsters bars or veteran rock singer Jun In Kwon.

**TL;DR: It's a very varied, accomplished record and a great return to the industry for the trio. Long time fans will miss the lack of a true callback to Mi Rae and Tiger's old school hip hop style - but whilst the record ultimately strays from what made Tiger and Mi Rae household names it is by no means less accomplished in its chosen genre.**

Alright so that's it for now, I'll add more once I find more stuff that is at least half decent quality. You can post some in the comments and I'll add them.

Another thought from my perspective, it seems that at this years SMTown, most idols did in fact, sing live, so that's pretty cool. :)

I am surveying kpop fans who know about Miss A as well as non-kpop fans, asking them who their favourite member is. I will then be comparing the results! 
 
I know Suzy is quite popular right among us kpop fans right? Will she make a first impression on non-kpop fans? Or will a different member stand out? Us kpop fans may have a bias after getting to know a member for a while. Maybe we like their vocal skills or maybe their dancing. Maybe it is their personality. Non-kpop fans will have to make their decision based on image only. OMG WHAT WILL THE RESULTS LOOK LIKE???
 
Anyways, if you are willing to help out, it would be greatly appreciated!

In a recent interview with HipHopPlaya on March 24th, Rap Monster discusses Bobby Diss rap towards him, BTS and other idol rappers. He also receives some advice from Zico.



Q: Then lets talk about the battle(?) with Bobby. What started it?

RM: Bobby made references to me a few times on Show Me The Money. He seemed to enjoy using words like sangnamja (T/N: true man, also the title for Boy in Luv) and leading a fast life (T/N: pronounced as Bangtang). Saying Like a true man, I lead a fast life isnt a common mix of words, right? I thought that it wasnt just a coincidence. He not only attacked Bangtan, but Boyfriend as well. It was the context of, Everything you guys messed up, Ill show it all here. However, I didnt even have much thoughts on it at that point either. I just thought, Bobby probably just dislikes us. However, on his lyrics for Come Here, there were lyrics that seemed to be targeting us again. I live a fast life, theres no need for pretty boys / They call me a monster, I never called myself that / You guys like a full-length mirror much better than a basement dungeon / If my skills were looks, then I would look like Wonbin in front of a bulletproof mirror. But to be honest, Bobby isnt really a Wonbin (laughter)


Q: Then is he Hyunbin?

RM: Anyways, these lyrics were the third time. I felt like I would be an idiot if I just endured it till the third time. If I didnt give feedback in any way, then it would also be insulting to fans, and I personally couldnt let it pass as well. Truthfully, I was planning to use lyrics from my [RM] mixtape on the MAMA stage. However, after listening to Come Here, I quickly changed the lyrics to reply to Bobby. And then as people caught onto those lyrics, it ended up becoming a hot topic. However, I personally respect Bobby. He does really well on stage. Although I dont think his raps are exceptional or that he has a wide spectrum, his ability to dominate the stage is good, and he has a cool style of hip-hop that rappers arent able to achieve. And the fact that he won SMTM whether or not he had his companys power or not is definitely something that confirmed himself.


Q: It became a topic whether it was a diss round or battle.

RM: I think it became an even larger topic, because both Bobby and I are in the category of idols. I also felt like they were putting us together to fight (laughter). However, it wasnt to that point.


Q: I heard you guys greeted each other behind MAMA.

RM: After the performance ended, I went down but Bobby high-fived me from behind the stage. He said that he mouthed my lyrics and saw it well. I found out that when I was performing on stage, Bobby was watching me attentively.


Q: If you push and see that situation, I feel like Bobbys mind is very hip-hop. Doesnt it seem like he realizes that its both a competitor and game that forms within music?

RM: Thats exactly it. Thats exactly what I want to say, but people dont understand it well. Our fans are worried that well end up fighting like this (laughter). However, I hope that they realize that its not like that.


Q: Pushing aside whos good or bad or whose side youre on or not, I think its just nice to see. I feel like you guys would give synergy to each other too.

RM: Thats true. Wasnt Swings control crisis also a way to pull up all the levels of everyone through competing musically. However, because Bobby and I are both under the category of idols, I think it became a larger controversy. I hope that many people are able to realize that within hip-hop, this is a way to express yourself and that its natural.


Q: You did the MAMA stage with Zico. Did Zico give you this or that kind of advice?

RM: I knew Zico hyung ever since I was a young child. I believe that hyungs actions in general show me a lot. It gives me help, but also stimulates me.


Q: So is it like a relationship like Seo Janghoon and Hyun Jooyeop?

RM: That I dont really know about.

Q: Before you went on stage for MAMA, what did you guys talk about?
RM: Truthfully, I wrote out the lyrics that I would do at MAMA 4~5 days in advance. After I said that, Zico hyung told me that its dangerous to write lyrics quickly like that and that I should ys in advance. After I said that, Zico hyung told me that its dangerous to write lyrics quickly like that and that I should",11,42

All the Korean sites I found say it only costs 5 thousand won, but their English advertisements are advertising prices from 200 thousand won to 300 thousand won for varying degrees of seating?? I'm really confused and would appreciate it if anyone could explain how they were able to watch the concert if you ever watched it in previous years. Thank you!

EDIT: After asking some people who have done it before and emailing directly with the organizers, it looks like the 5,000 won seats are the general seats in the stadium. It is also sold on Interpark which requires a Korean citizenship ID number and credit card, which makes it harder for foreigners to get. The lady I was emailing with told me that the ground seats which are closer to the stage are only being sold through Lotte JTB to foreigners, which is why they are much more expensive.",10,8

1104,2015-3-26,2015,3,26,10,30blen,Fan letter to Girls' Generation!,JustAnotherHC,1427332077,"Hey guys, I'm a user from /r/SNSD and I'm also one of the people who subbed a few parts of The TTS a few months back. 

I'm here with some info about how you can send fan letters to the members of SNSD! 

BUT WAIT, read these notes first:

1. DO NOT SEAL YOUR LETTER
    Obviously seal the envelope thats going in the mail, but put your written letter in
    another UNSEALED envelope, so that I can translate and SM can read. Refer to diagram [here](http://i.imgur.com/80RiNOD.png).

2. Yes, SM Entertainment will go over these for SNSDs protection.
    As you can imagine, there are some people out there who will write creepy
    letters, and SM Ent. will be making sure none of those make it through.

3. Write in ENGLISH or KOREAN! I will be reading and translating these, and I dont
    speak any language other than English or Korean.

4. Put a dollar or two or five or ten in there to help a poor student out with intl postage and PO box rental... :)
    Just kidding, you dont have to, but it would help me out a lot.

5. Please write on the outside of the unsealed envelope whom you are addressing
    your letter to. Or you could address it to multiple/all members.

6. It goes without saying, but don't expect a reply; as you can imagine, the girls are very busy and while they will try to read all of them, they can't possibly respond to you. 

7. It might take a while for the girls to get the letters. I will be collecting them over the next 2 months, sending it over to the fan cafe's admins (int'l postage is too expensive $$$ for more shipments), then they will wrap it up and send it over to SM Entertainment. 

8. There is no way for me, the fan cafe admins, and therefore you to make absolutely sure and confirm that they have received your letter. 



I don't know the specific rules as to what exactly is ""creepy"" and censorable and what is not, and I can't get in contact with SM, only the Korean fan cafe, so I can't answer that question.

Are you still with me? Mail it to:

SNSD Letters

PO Box 505

Concord, MA 01742

United States

Please note that only USPS can deliver to that PO box. If you wish to use a different letter carrier for some reason, PM me.


 Thats it! If you have any questions, leave a comment. I probably missed something, so definitely comment if I have. Every one of your
    letters will get to the girls (as long as SM doesnt censor it, so dont be naughty!)

If there is enough demand, I might consider fan letters to GFriend (), mostly because they're company put up an address to send fan letters. If you are aware of any other companies that do this for other kpop singers, please let me know and I'll see if I can arrange something for them as well. 

EDIT 1: For people that don't live in the US, you can send it to this address. Beware that int'l shipping on your part may be pricey.

SNSD Letters

34 Walden Street #505

Concord, MA 01742

United States of America


ALSO, YOU CAN'T SEND ANYTHING MORE THAN A LETTER/REALLY SMALL GIFT THAT FITS IN THE ENVELOPE. SM Ent. doesn't accept ""gifts"" as a matter of principle. My PO box isn't big enough for that anyway.

1128,2015-3-26,2015,3,26,21,30d596,Unexpected family ties - ex-1st gen. Baby Vox member  (Cha Yumi) and Keith Ape (aka the 'It G Ma' rapper),giga90,1427372257,"http://imgur.com/yCUUfAJ

So while I was browsing Facebook, I happen to come across a post from my friend Lola Fair. She's a LA-based singer and songwriter. Lola Fair isn't her real name however. Her real name is Yumi Cha, and for super old-school K-pop fans, that is a familiar name as she was a former 1st gen member of legendary girl group Baby VOX (pre-Yoon Eun Hye and Kan Miyoun era).

Anyways, the post was a link to an article on VICE about a recent SXSW show featuring rising Korean rapper Keith Ape's first performance in the US. She mentioned 'cousin' in the post and I proceeded to ask her if they were actually related, and it turns out they are! That was today's fun fact for ya'll :)",3,22

1216,2015-3-28,2015,3,28,12,30kgjr,I went to the Amoeba Culture Concert in Atlanta,mAssEffectdriven,1427514402,"The concert was incredible. DJ Friz got the crowd hot with a small EDM set in the beginning. Then Crush came out and sang some tracks from his album like A Little Bit, Sometimes, and I Fancy You. 

He finished off with Hug Me which is when Zion T came out. They sang Two Melodies and Just after which Crush left and Zion T did his set. Zion T and Primary together did his songs off of The Messengers album. Which brought Choiza and then Gaeko with [Question Mark](https://youtu.be/4R1JfUYoRT4) and [Babay](https://youtu.be/HxCH2y3vSrI) respectively. 

Zion T went back in and then Dynamic Duo finished off with [BAAAM](https://youtu.be/9ZDFLcWO1qg) and a few other tracks from Lucky Numbers and their most popular singles from their past albums.

All in all the music was incredible, the singing, rapping, and djing was on point. The crowd was loud and responsive, we sang along and got hype. The atmosphere was great.

This was all really overshadowed by the poor organization of MusicEnkor, the group that set up this tour. When I arrived there were no clear lines indicating which line was VIP, Priority Pass, and General Admission. While we were waiting a sizeable group of people ended up leaving the VIP line because they had mistaken it for the PP line. 

When we got in it was okay, but when the concert started, about 10 people with ""press passes"" pushed their way to the front where there wasn't room for them to be. The kicker being that when the concert started, they pulled out their phones and started snapping photos and recording videos. 

The icing on the cake was that when the concert ended, the VIP ticketholders would get to ""meet and greet"" the artists. They didn't bother to direct any of to where it was being held or where to line up and then they announced that to save time, they would be making us take pictures with the artists in groups of 10. 

So lets count, you have 2 in Dynamic Duo, Crush and Zion t, then Primary and DJ Friz. 6 people plus the 10 ""VIP"" fans for a whopping 16 people per photo. On top of that, they don't allow you to take your own photo with your phone. You pay 200$ for a photo with 6 artists and 9 others you may or may not know. So rather than a ""meet and greet"" its more of a fuck you pay me kind of deal. 

I've been a fan of Dynamic Duo before they were even Dynamic Duo. I was a little kid back then and of course I couldnt go to any of their concerts and this was my first ever concert I attended with them. The music was even better than I expected live however the organizers of this event were such wet blankets.

I definitely want to see more Korean acts perform in America, but not if MusicEnkor is organizing them. 

So I guess for those of you who bought VIP tickets for New York, I hope it goes way better. For me the experience left a bad taste in my mouth which was a shame because Amoeba Culture was amazing and I cannot overstate that enough. These guys were killing it on stage.

TL;DR No disrespect to AmoebaCulture, All disrespect to Music Enkor

Tickets will go on sale 4/25 at 10AM (no info yet on where you can purchase the tickets though)

Ticket prices for all four venues range from $65-$205

Hi-touch opportunity for VIP and VIP+ ticket buyers

SubKulture's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/subkultureent) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SubKultureEnt) have specific seating charts and prices for each venue and also info on giveaways and bonuses for VIP tickets.

Also, sort of OT but [Jazzy Group](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=678274295617262)  announced that there's a ~mystery group~ tour planned for May that will go to Dallas, Chicago, and San Francisco.

Which Ones Are Treated the BEST?,Glensather,1427700662,"By best, I mean which group generally seems to be the happiest or least stressed out when they're in public. We know they have to put on some sort of act because public appearances and whatnot, but it's still pretty easy to tell from things like facial expressions and body language whether or not they really want to be doing what it is they're doing.

I bring this up because I've been marathoning Running Man lately; my mom suggested it to me since I wanted to get into some of the variety shows because she thinks its hilarious, and from what I've seen I'll have to agree with her. They occasionally throw out some cultural jokes that I have to get back to her about, but the show itself is generally pretty good. But that's beside the point.

I started at Episode one, and somewhere in the 60s SNSD (well, most of them) shows up for a couple of episodes. There was *something* about both of them that kinda threw me off. They seemed very... ah, stiff. The only ones who actually looked like they wanted to be there were Yoona and Jessica because they seemed to be having the most fun - or at least in Jessica's case, was really into the spirit of competition. Everyone else seemed to be... ah, phoning it in.

Compare anytime f(x) gets facetime. They are almost completely the opposite. They all like showing off and goofing around, and you never get the impression that they're being forced into whatever show they're doing at that moment. I'm sure it's because since they're not as popular there's not as much pressure, but they always seem to be having a good time.

Likewise, BtoB seems like they'd be a lot of fun to hang out with. I haven't seen a lot of them, but they genuinely seem happier than a lot of boy groups. Speaking of Cube, *all* of their artists seem to be genuinely happier than SMs for sure. Except maybe BEAST, but I get this impression they're a bit more serious than others.

Maybe I'm reading into this wrong, but maybe not. I just think it'd be fun to have a discussion over which groups are the happiest as opposed to which ones get treated the most like crap.",78,47

KittiB, Choi Sam, LE (EXID), Jucy (EvoL), M-Zero, Heize, Gilme (Clover), Kasper (Play the Siren), Kemy (A.Kor)

P.S. For those who noticed I did not include Miryo, Lexy, Yoon Mi Rae or CL on that shortlist, here's why: the first three are practically OGs in Korea and it would be way too one-sided IMO if they came on as contestants against these youngins. As for CL, I can't see her doing a show like this, and she's already occupied with her pending US debut.

^*EXO's ^Call ^Me ^Baby ^ranked ^29th ^on ^the ^Melon's ^Weekly ^Charts ^while ^8th ^on ^iChart. ^The ^extreme ^difference ^here ^is ^probably ^due ^to ^slightly ^different ^cut-off ^times ^for ^iChart ^and ^Melon ^and ^the ^fact ^that ^the ^single ^had ^just ^came ^out. ^Also, ^the ^huge ^market ^share ^of ^Melon; ^much ^bigger ^number ^of ^plays ^of ^songs ^in ^general; ^makes ^it ^hard ^for ^a ^single ^that ^has ^just ^come ^out ^to ^make ^an ^immediate ^impact ^on ^the ^weekly ^charts. ^Naturally ^it ^went ^straight ^to ^#1 ^in ^the ^real ^time ^charts.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of ten major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=13)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/index.htm#params%5Bidx%5D=1&amp;params%5BstartDay%5D=20150323&amp;params%5BendDay%5D=20150329&amp;params%5BisFirstDate%5D=false&amp;params%5BisLastDate%5D=true)

1361,2015-3-31,2015,3,31,14,30wb0z,My experience with Arirang's After School Club,Teitoku,1427780659,"I submitted an application for the ASC with NS YoonG the same day it was posted on their twitter. About half a week later I received a message saying that I was accepted. It also came with a long list of guidlines and information of how it all worked.

The unfortunate thing is that they trashed [my application](http://i.imgur.com/2Y3y7W4.png) and gave me someone else's [question](http://i.imgur.com/WGL1m07.png). Lots of speculation on why this happened, but no real reason was given.

At about 20:10 US Central, I received the link for the hangout. After a few of us joined, Arirang staff joined and gave us a quick audio/video check and ran through the scripts. As an aside, I got some giggles from the staff member and one of the people overseeing her with my ""Howdy y'all! I'm calling from Texas"" introduction. They actually removed the fanart 2 others had brought and removed a rap from another girl, and injected some more prechosen questions into their slots instead.

About 30 minutes until the show started we did another audio check. Everyone was getting super nervous at this point, so I tried to just calm them down letting them know just to ""be confident and it'll be ok"".

Once the show started, the stream popped up on the staff members window of the google hangout and we waited for what felt like an eternity. Finally the first girl went, and had mute problems because she wasn't paying attention. It was funny seeing the staff member typing ""UNMUTE"" multiple times. After her and the second girl, it was my turn. They kinda threw the script out the window with Eric reacting to my cowboy hat, but I was able to squeeze in my best ""Howdy"" and let them know I was from Texas. After my first question, I glanced at IRC and saw so many highlights I was distracted for the rest of the time.

After that there was a quick break before getting to the next three. Unfortunately one girl was left out, but she will get a random signed CD for not appearing (which would be a shit compromise if you missed out on talking to your bias).

At the end, I told the staff member thanks and asked to let Jimin know that she's looking absolutely WONDERFUL. Which she is, she looked great on this weeks episode.

Friends were nice enough to take some [humiliating screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/2f816Jf.png). Despite the upsetting removal of my questions and the scriptedness of it, I thought it was a very fun experience and encourage all of y'all to give it a shot if you see one of your groups.

Episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUEE0K4lJ9Y&amp;feature=youtu.be

My cut: https://youtu.be/LUEE0K4lJ9Y?t=1939

I refuse to watch it because I know how cringe it is already.
