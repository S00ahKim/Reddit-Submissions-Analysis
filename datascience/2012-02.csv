I have an MS in Computer Science and a MA in Statistics plus 2 years of experience as a software developer.  In academia I focused primarily on data analytics, machine learning, regression, ANOVA, and math theory courses such as linear programming, natural language processing, linear algebra, and probability theory.  My passion is data analysis, data mining, machine learning and applied statistics.

My background is definitely focused on theory rather than applications, and I am alleviating this difficulty by working on Kaggle problems, refreshing my R programming and studying Hadoop.

Would learning SQL be useful?

Any other advice would be appreciated.",7,4
