About eight of the ten links I tried to submit were immediately downvoted, and even reported (to myself). Last [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/wiu3k/tutorial_using_the_sparql_package_in_r_to_handle/), 40min. ago.

Requests for [explanation] (http://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v5o5q/towards_a_global_lookup_service_for_corporate_ids/c51jvae) for the downvotes are ignored.

Please, either (1) submit the kind of content you like to see in /r/datascience,  indicate why you downvote so that submissions can be adapted, or (3) unsubscribe.",2,3
