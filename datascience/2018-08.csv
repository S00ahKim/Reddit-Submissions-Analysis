First time posting in this sub :)

I am working on a problem where I have a time series of sales data. Somewhere in the data, there was a promotion that took place, and lasted for the rest of the time series. My task is to find when that happened.

I have googled very hard, and found techniques such as Intervention Analysis (which works when you know when the promotion happened, and is used to analyze the effect of promotion). There are decomposition methods such as STL, in which we can examine the residuals to see if there are anomalies. However, there appears to be multiple such anomalies in the data I'm working with.

I'm sure this is a common problem in e-commerce or sales in general. So what is the method to be used here? I'm very surprised that there are no posts of this on Google. I'm sure I'm missing something - probably just googling for the wrong key words. 

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks!",3,5

I never wrote complicated functions or anything. It was mostly stuff I learnt while doing uni coursework. This will be my first time working on a real life project with R.

Below is the description of the project. Thanks

**Predicting the suitability of student applicants from their Statement of Purpose.**

This project will take place at the Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition. There are three phases to this project. In Phase 1, the successful candidate will need to manually build a small learning data set to bootstrap the process. The candidate is expected to start with using LDA or other feature construction techniques to create the training data set. 

In Phase 2, the candidate will need to develop a R code to read a text input and predict the suitability of the applicant against the course he or she has applied for. There are two possible ways to approach this: from comparing the LDA outputs, or through traditional classification modelling, or a combination of both. 

Once the model is built, the applicant is expected to build in Phase 3, a Web-based interface to accept statement of purpose inputs from the user and feeds this to the predictive model created in Phase 2. The result of each prediction is to be sent to a designated email address.

Students interested in applying for this project should be comfortable working with R and preferably, have knowledge of building a Web-based application from their UG studies. The Web applications skill set is desirable but not compulsory as Phase 1 and 2 are the key aspects of this project.",0,3

So, I have an interview with my state's Department of Labor and Employment for what they are calling a data analyst position. The position would help to collect data for the state and submit it to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are going to hire either a data analyst I (bachelors degree) or data analyst II (bachelors + 1 year of experience with complex data sets) depending on the top candidates credentials. This would be close to my dream job because:

1. It's actually utilizing my major in my degree
2. It's a job that I would actually enjoy and love going to
3. I want to pursue a PhD in economics so doing work along the state and BLS would be superb and prepare me for that

But I don't have data analytics experience. I have a B.S. in economics and I took a course on econometrics and programming in SAS. I worked in quality improvement for a healthcare insurance company and I used SQL server, Access, and R programming to work with 100,000+ rows of patient data. I worked with analytics team and experimented on my own because I really want to learn how to do research with R and Sql, but almost all of what I did was on the front end. I was very honest in my resume and application and made sure to say that I \*facilitated\* data collection, input, and analyzation in \*collaboration\* with analytics teams. Next to my skills for R, Sql/T-Sql/SAS i put (beginner). 

However, the listing for the job doesn't name any programs or knowledge of programs, so I'm not sure what would be involved. I will post the job announcement wording below in the hopes that someone can help me decipher what is expected for this position since programs aren't listed. They told me it would be a panel interview and that I would be given a data handout to do, but they won't tell me what this handout entails (I'm assuming because they want to see how I do under pressure and without resources). My roommate who is a network engineer that programs in python told me for their IT interviews they're looking to see what level you are at and he recommended that if I don't know something I should be honest and say ""I'm not sure how to solve this because I mostly worked on the front end"" rather than try to BS it with the interviewers and fish for an answer.

Anyway, I was chosen as a top applicant and invited for interview, but I don't know what to expect for the interview and don't know if I should spend time brushing up on basic statistics and basic R or if I should brush up on economics (e.g. the types of unemployment rates reported and how to calculate them. I appreciate any feedback you guys can give.

Initially developed by Google to rank websites according to their importance, it works pretty well on passing networks.

Data source: The authors of the previously mentioned article had limited data and only analyzed the teams that reached the knockout stages of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. So, I set out on a quest to find more data and piece it together to form passing networks. I used headless browsing for the most part since most publicly accessible soccer websites are notoriously hard to scrape using conventional techniques (using just Python and the requests library for instance). I scraped many of the popular sites like whoscored.com, flashscore.com, the official league sites and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) Kaggle dataset. It was not easy and there are definitely some mistakes here and there, but after manually checking a couple hundred of the games it was largely OK.

I'm still working on per-team analysis to find out who is performing the best and using additional techniques from graph/network theory (like community detection) on passing networks.

The tools used here are: Python, Django, NetworkX and SigmaJS.",5,16

Spoiler alert: I'm leaning towards the Economics second major. But let me explain my reasons.

To set some background information, I am a statistics major. Both the second major and year-long internship programmes are offered by the school. Meaning I would still pay the same school fees. The extra fees I would be paying for the internship would be the cost of living + airfare + insurance etc etc.

The reason why I'm leaning towards econs is because of my future ambitions. I'm interested in a couple areas, such as fintech, and also things like finance, studying of economies, econometrics. I envision working in a data science role, either in a tech company or finance company. Think Product Manager, Data Analyst, Data Scientist and the like.

On the other hand, the internship is more targeted towards entrepreneurship. The only thing going for it, I guess, is that it is quite popular and often oversubscribed (I heard acceptance rate is 20 - 25%). The locations students can choose from are also quite enticing, such as Silicon Valley / Beijing / New York etc. Once you are accepted, you will self-source for a internship with a tech start-up and settle everything yourself from there. You can also take classes (with a lower academic workload of course) with partner universities during the 1 year there.

My reasons for leaning towards the double major is because I'm not too interested in entrepreneurship, and I also believe that the path of this particular double major combination aligns more with my goals. I envision working in the fields I mentioned earlier, and I feel like even though there is a lot of discussion about how paper certificates are losing their appeal and students should opt for internships, this double major certification would open up more doors for me than a 1 year overseas internship.

I don't know if this matters, but I'm also considering going for a Statistics Master's after gaining some job experience.

I'm self-taught using online resources and I've written a Python script (using only built-in modules) that successfully processes small datasets, but I don't yet know how to properly process large datasets and I need to learn this. I'm using Linux, with an i7 processor and 4 GB of RAM.

Basically, here's the project: 

- Read in a .txt file with two columns of data. 

- One column is the name of a product, a second column is the price of the product from some source. The product appears potentially many times, always with a different price. Like this:

    data_input = [['product_name', 'price'], ['bed', '600'], ['chair', '100'], ['bed', '800'], 'chair', '140'], ['fridge', '1000'], ['fridge', '2000'], ['knives', '180']]


- The output data should be 3 columns, where each product appears on one row, with the product name in one column, the total price in a second column, and the total count of products in a third column.

    data_output = [['product_name', 'total_cost', 'total_count'], ['bed', '1400', 2], ['chair', '240', 2], ['fridge', '3000', 2], [['product_name', 'price', 'count'], ['bed', '600', 1], ['chair', '100', 1], ['bed', '800', 1], 'chair', '140', 1], ['fridge', '1000', 1], ['knives', '180', 1]]

So, like I said, I've already written a Python script that does this for a small dataset like above. But when I expand the input data file so it's in excess of 1 GB and my computer lags with millions of rows, the computer just stalls and won't process the dataset.

What software or other language or Python technique or other method do I need to use to make this work so my code will successfully process massive datasets? And where can I look to learn how to do this?",23,5

1. **R and Python programming**
2. **Statistics**
3. **Visualisation**
4. **Machine learning**

These skills are important to start a career in data science. In fact, these skills form the foundation of every major task that a data scientist does. These technologies ( or skills) are utilised across these 

1. **Data collection and cleaning** You are required to collection a large amount of data using different tools and technologies. This data is unstructured and needs to be cleaned to filter data thats really required.
2. **Analysis**  You use statistical techniques to analyse data.
3. **Visualisation** You need to know tools like Tableau, gglpots.
4. **Predictive modelling** You need to know machine learning algorithms for these.

Now, looking at the above skills you might feel that its a lot of learn for a fresher. It definitely is. However, you dont have to learn all these skills at once. You can begin by learning *statistics*. I recently wrote an answer on Quora which you can refer below.

[Gautam Tiwari's answer to What will be the first step to be a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-first-step-to-be-a-data-scientist/answer/Gautam-Tiwari-27)

Next, you can learn R and Python programming, and predictive modelling using machine learning algorithms.

Now, as a fresher, youre not required to know all of the above skills. Its just that companies have priorities when they hire a data scientist or a data analyst, it and completely depends on what they expect their candidate to do. While some companies might require you to do all of the above tasks, at a few companies you just need to perform one or few tasks. However, its to best learn the basics of all, if possible. This will give you more opportunities and you would know what you are more comfortable with.

Next, as a fresher, the following are some major techniques you should focus on. As these techniques are frequently used in data analysis and companies look for candidates who have strong command on these. This will help you make your chances better for getting your first data science job.

**1. Exploratory data analysis**

**2 Missing value analysis**

**3. Outlier analysis**

**4. Feature scaling**

**5. Sampling techniques**

**6. Error Metrics Classification**

**7. Error Metrics Regression**

**8. Random Forest**

**9. Linear Regression**

**10. Logistic regression**

**11. Visualisations**

**12. KNN**

**13. Native Bayes**

All in all, learn the above skills. Next, you should focus on projects. If you can work on projects related to all the above. It would be great, else you should focus majorly on data collection and cleaning projects. As this is the major skill that companies look for in freshers and in most cases that is also their primary task. Hence, if you have done projects related to collection and cleaning, it would immensely increase your chances of getting a job in data science.

Also, companies prefer candidates who come with data handling experience. Having projects ensures that you can look after data without losing it. As losing data can cause loss of millions to companies and in case of sensitive data, it can also jeopardise a business.

When you have the skills and projects, you can apply for jobs. Apply thorough [Angellist](http://angejlist.co/). You will find start-ups, and early stage start-ups here. Or you can also apply through company websites.

Put simply, you should follow this simple approach 

1. **Learn the skills required to be a data scientist**
2. **Work on projects**
3. **Get hired as a Data Scientist**

You can use platforms like **Udemy, Udacity, Edureka, edWisor**to learn the above skills. However, I would suggest you to use [edwisor.](https://edwisor.com?ref=redP) Here you can learn [all the above skills while working on projects. ](https://edwisor.com?ref=redP)These projects can be easily used as your portfolio. Plus, there are a lot of analytics companies that hire for data science roles through edwisor based on the projects people do here. So give it a spin.

Best of luck!",5,0

I'm working as a data scientist in an internet company, and i've been requested to think about ways to apply machine learning on a website in order to increase conversion rate.  

Is there a known paradigm to tackle such a problem? 

my initial thought was do some personalization, that is, adjust a customized set of components (such as font sizes, number of items in a list, background colors or images) that may have a positive effect on the user behaviour (which can result in conversion).

If it's indeed the proper way to tackle this problem, than i'm not sure how to implement it.

How can i choose the proper set of components that maximize the conversion rate? Should be a recommendation system framework? or i can run a lot of randomized experiments, see what's the ""best"" component, and set it as the target variable and then use some classification algorithms? 

Any advice would be appreciated,

Thank you.

I know this won't get me a career in data science, I just want it as career enhancer/complement as I work in project management. I found several programs online, but absolutely want to weigh options before committing to one:

1) Temple Univ.: [https://noncredit.temple.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=155191](https://noncredit.temple.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=155191)

This one is extremely cheap ($495.00). But it is so cheap, comparatively, that I wonder if there is an issue of getting what you pay for? I know that no certificate program will be as comprehensive as a degree, but I still want something worthwhile. However, if I am not hinging a career on data analysis - just complementing it- would this really be all that is necessary?

2) Boston Univ.: [https://www.bu.edu/online/programs/certificate-programs/data-analytics/#cost](https://www.bu.edu/online/programs/certificate-programs/data-analytics/#cost)

Of the programs I found, this seems like best middle ground between cost and comprehensiveness. However, they have a stat course prereq I am not positive I meet. I took a standard statistics course in undergrad, however not sure that meets their requirement. 

3) Cornell: [https://www.ecornell.com/certificates/data-science/data-analytics/](https://www.ecornell.com/certificates/data-science/data-analytics/)

I know this has an Ivy league name attached to it, and I sure it is not of poor quality, but it also does not seem as comprehensive for the cost ($3,600)?

4) UCLA: [https://www.uclaextension.edu/digital-technology/data-analytics-management/certificate/data-science](https://www.uclaextension.edu/digital-technology/data-analytics-management/certificate/data-science)

This certainly seems like the most comprehensive one and most worthwhile. However, also the most expensive ($4700).

My code is [here](https://github.com/MProx/DQN-atari/blob/master/DQN.py). The tutorial I followed is [here.](https://becominghuman.ai/lets-build-an-atari-ai-part-1-dqn-df57e8ff3b26)

I have implemented a Keras convolutional neural network using TensorFlow in the back end. I have made sure that Tensorflow is configured for GPU utility (Cuda, CuDNN, etc). I have confirmed that this is working, because another convolutional neural network that I built previously (an MNIST classifier) is about twice as fast now.  Running ""nvidia-smi"" from my terminal shows &gt;80% GPU utility - but only for that MNIST classifier. For my DQN model, it is still very slow and will take days or weeks to converge (if ever).  However, running ""nvidia-smi"" now shows only \~20% GPU utility. What is confusing to me is that my CPU usage (quad core) is only about 60% and my RAM has plenty of overhead. So where is the bottleneck? Is it just in the transfer times to move data around?  


Aside from this, I have read that I can increase GPU utility by increasing my training batch size (currently set to 32), but then I would be deviating from what was published in the Google paper, so then I will be in uncharted territory. I'm still new to deep learning and I'm not sure if this will actually speed up my learning rate? It seems like I would be better optimizing my GPU but also making it do a lot more work, so the net result would be the same?  


I went through the code and timed the various operations, and I found the most time-consuming operations were making predictions with the model, and also training it. So I'm fairly convinced that my  preprocessing, etc, is quite efficient, because if I comment out the training and prediction parts, the code becomes MUCH faster.  


I have access to an AWS EC2 instance (one of the p2.xlarge GPU instances), but until I've worked out what is slowing this all down, I'm hesitant to spin that up. I doubt it will do much good?  


Any advice?",13,23

My plan: Use C# (Our main backend stack at the company) to pull in the data from their API, do the required data mapping, store the data in a new database, and push it to a service like Kenisis or Kafka to provide real-time analytics.

My reasoning: Our live chat service is our main point of customer support. If we were to integrate that into ""real-time"" analytics we could pull in other logs and data to see changes to our SaaS product is causing an influx of chats.

In this blog post, Susan is trying to predict the employee turnover. There's a part where she assigns categorical variables, now my question is this. 

**After she assigns those values, she adds them to the columns. Basically she adds the departments to the columns and then starts modelling. If the departments are assigned to columns, why isn't she doing one hot encoding or something else to fill them up?** 

Or am I mistaken, if my question is not clear, can someone please take the time to explain me the categorical varibles and where she adds the columns and she's hoping to achieve. Learning data science without a mentor and teacher is kinda difficult, it would be a great help if you guys helped me here.

First, you must take a special rock and you shoot lightning in it. Then you take this rock and you teach it how to think. You teach it to predict what's going to happen in the future, using language that can explain the spacetime fabric (aka math). The rock then tells you and the group of people you work with what you should do in order to become successful in life

1. The major insurer that I work for is *incredibly* compartmentalized. We have very specific tasks that we work on and are very often just small pieces in a long chain of deliverables.

2. Models are largely black boxes. We have IT and development teams that support the infrastructure and we are mired in enormous model governance controls that make it a bitch to change small things in our models -- because of this, actuaries at our company do not have coding skills and I view this as a huge weakness.

3. The data we use is awful and actuaries here are not, on average, capable of cleaning it and using it effectively. 

I graduated in 2017 from a state school with a 3.17 in Math and Economics so I was thinking about finding a masters program in Statistics to get the GPA up and get more into stats.  My questions for /r/datascience:

1. Is a Master's degree necessary for me? Undergrad GPA was low and I don't have a lot of statistics theory knowledge (other than math-based probability from my first exam). 

2. Would it be better to just knock out the Masters in 1-2 years or do it part-time for 2-4 years? I can petition my current employer for up to $5k per year in tuition reimbursement. 

3. There is an [applied statistics program at Colorado St](https://mas.colostate.edu/) that is really interesting to me but I don't know if it is a red flag that they prefer their own math test as opposed to the GRE? I don't see any classes using Python so that is something that I would self-learn -- but other than that, are there any major holes in the curriculum?

I have scoured the internet for answers to this question and haven't come up with anything satisfying yet, so I turn here even though this may not be the best place for this question.

I am currently doing a writeup on my website for an analysis project I have done, and I would like to display Pandas output from a JNotebook on my site. I have tried exporting to HTML, but my site's CSS template does not agree with my table. I am no designer, and I really don't want to go in and fiddle with it.

Ideally, I would have it look [just like it looks in the notebook](https://imgur.com/h5LUph9), but taking screenshots just feels unprofessional and inconsistent. I've tried plotting the tables using matplotlib and saving the figures like I'm doing with the graphs I am including in my writeup, but the matplotlib table plot is extremely ugly.

Is there any way to save and export the output exactly as it looks in the notebook, or is there another good way you folks know of for displaying Pandas tables using HTML/CSS/Markdown?",6,7

I have the task of finding the right appropriate analytics tool for our department (internal audit function). Since there are so many tools out there, i'm hoping someone can point me to the right direction. 

Our requirements are:

1. Code free (or very limited coding required). Since we're not coders/programmers, we need something along the line of drag and drop :(

2.  We want to be able to connect to databases and perform continuous testing based on a set of conditions. For example, we want to be able to connect to Travel expense data and have any meals over $75 flagged as potential violations to be investigated. Ideally this will be refreshed monthly/quarterly

3. Visualization (Optional): management likes pretty interactive charts. We can always use Tableau for this.

We have Tableau, but not sure if Tableau can do #2 well? I've seen Alteryx demos and it seems to be able to do #2, but the price tag is too high for us. Thank you all in advance for helping me!",11,1

I worked for about 2 years while in school at 3 different organizations as a part-time data analyst. Before applying for full-time positions while in undergrad I considered applying to the MIDS program at Berkeley, but decided against it after figuring that it might be more beneficial later on in my career. A former MIDS graduate advised me to work first before applying, especially seeing as many students in the program are professionals with years of experience. 

My current full-time arrangement has not been exceptionally rigorous, and it offers me flexibility and a 37.5 hour work week, which leaves me with lots of time during non-work hours. It seems to me like an ideal opportunity to spend 20 months on a Master's program, seeing as I am working to be able to afford the program, single, have free time and am in the area. However, my main reservation is that I haven't had the experience of working as a professional for several years, and haven't had to go through years of exposure, and have only worked in the field for a very short amount of time and at a limited number of different organizations.

TL;DR Is it too early in my career to apply for the UC Berkeley MIDS program at 22 years old as a new full-time Data Analyst employee in San Francisco?",1,1

Curious to hear the thoughts of more experienced professionals and even those new to the game like myself. 

I've been exploring the idea of either enrolling into an analytics type certificate program or pursuing a certification similar to the one offered by INFORMS. I don't have formal training in math or computer science apart from courses taken during my undergrad (health science) and masters (applied health science). Currently however I find myseld in a career where 50% of my responsibilities include data intensive tasks related to performance management and organizational/operational improvement. These tasks include data cleaning, ETL from multiple data sources, analysis, visualization, and very little modelling at the moment but this may change. Lately I've been wondering if it's worth me investing time and money into a formal training program.

I'm suspect that many of these certification programs are cash grabs and that I would be better served continuing to learn as I have been (i.e. on my own). I currently use a blend of SQL, R, and Power BI for daily tasks. Has anyone taken a certification program and found it to be beneficial? Thanks for your time all. ",5,5

The way we are obtaining most of the new data scientists is through internal hiring. Basically an article was sent out to everyone to gauge interest in data science, and if you were interested, you simply reply with some of your skills/experience/ qualifications and you are on your way with a set training path that HR decided to be best (through talking with various SMEs apparently). The whole process is as follows:
- Complete Andrew Ngs ML course
- Complete Intro to R as well as some more advanced R
- Complete Intro to Python as well as Advanced Python
- Complete Intro to SAS Programming
- After about 2 months of this training, a Data Science assessment is given in Codility in which we are to have a week to complete

First, my question is regarding Codility. Has anyone taken a Data Science assessment through Codility? If so, any thoughts? I tried searching the internet for feedback on questions asked, topics to study, languages to be prepared for (Im assuming we can use R and Python since we were given the most training courses in those 2), but there arent many results for the Data Science topic. Im not entirely sure how to prepare other than just reading through some logical programming puzzles (like reading Elements of Programming Interviews) and brushing up on Data Science questions (EDA, advanced models, etc..). Anything else I should be prepared for?

Second, what are everyones thoughts on this entire training process? Do you feel this is a viable way to select a Data Science candidate? Is 2 months enough time for someone to learn R and Python (since Intro courses were assigned, I would assume HR believes at least some candidates dont have much prior knowledge) and be able to successfully take a coding assessment? Should this assessment really be what decides what candidates are successful? Interested in hearing thoughts from some of the veteran Data Scientists.",25,39

My issue is that the main two metrics I would use in my typical analysis are composition distributions. Typically the shapes of these distributions have been helpful in determining what formulations will be most effective at certain concentrations. I would usually use a PCA type analysis and from there cluster based on the main PCs, however I think this will only consider the individual points in the curve and not the relative distribution. Is there a way to capture this information prior to clustering? If there are any good sources on this it would be very helpful.

TL;DR What methods would account for the shape of a distribution in clustering analysis?

We have a ton of data that says the time of every sale for similar events in the past.

No one in my office knows anything about data science, including me for the most part, but I'm trying to teach myself. Previously they were using a moving average, which is obviously terrible and doesn't account for spikes close to the events.

I suggested to use a linear regression, because that's the only statistical model I know. So we record the sales every ten days and use those as the X variables, to try to predict what the sales will be by the day of the event.

So far this is working pretty good, but I know this would be frowned upon by people with statistics backgrounds. So I was hoping someone could suggest a better model that I could look in to?

Ideally it would be something that isn't too complex so I could explain it to my coworkers, and is also something I could implement using pandas

""Textual ETL"" is an ardous task, which involves 

* stop-word removal
* synonym concatenation
* homographic resolution
* thematic clustering
* an many more steps

IMHO this is an extreme waste of resources, because you do all of this preprocessing just to be able to use the standard BI tools for structured data.
This kind of preparation should only be done, if you know that you need it.
Also NLP-Tools and ML are probably more useful than standard BI analytics tools for processing text.

I've worked amongst data scientists as a software developer. I know that one key frustration for a data scientist is that your experiments may crash after hours/days of performing computationally intensive work. Python, the dominant language for data science, is an interpreted, dynamically-typed language which is highly prone to these types of runtime errors.

In the programming world, a language like Rust allows one to build a very robust system, because it has a ruthless compiler which performs strict type-checking and imposes very hard constraints on memory management. It is very annoying to write a Rust program, because the compiler yells at everything you do, but once you finally make the compiler happy, you are reassured that your program won't fail due to silly errors. At the moment, Rust would be wholly unsuitable for data science since it is designed for systems programming, and there does not seem to be a community for statistical/data science software for the Rust language.

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any languages, software frameworks, or even a development practice/paradigm out there that could help solve this problem for data science. Thanks!",4,2

I wanted to get this communitys opinions about whether this degree might make sense for my situation.

My Background:  Graduated two years ago with a business degree. I was specializing in accounting at one point but realized I absolutely hated it. Learned about data science in fourth year and decided to take MOOCs to learn enough data skills (R, python, SQL, some stats) to land a job as a data analyst. Ive been working as a data analyst for a large non-profit organization since graduation. Started with just building reports and dashboards but our analytics team has been growing and lately and Ive been doing more complex data analysis and some basic machine learning.

I know I can keep taking MOOCs and do Kaggle projects on the side to build a portfolio and land a data scientist job eventually. But coming from a non-technical background with little math or formal programming experience, I feel like I have so much ground to cover. I know no one knows everything in this field and that Impostor syndrome is normal, but I can't shake off the feeling that having rigorous knowledge of computer science would be beneficial for my career.

Im aware that MCIT isnt a full fledged masters degree in computer science. The whole unique selling point is that it's targeted towards students without a CS degree who are looking to transition into CS jobs. The on-campus program seems to have a good reputation and many graduates land jobs at Google, Amazon, etc. The tuition (around $26K) is also reasonable for a master's degree from an Ivey league school but obviously outrageously expensive if you compare it to free MOOCs or MicroMaster's. I'm also aware that some people will view online degrees as inferior but the flexibility will allow me to work full-time  which means I don't have to trade off all my income and experience for this degree.

For someone with my background, does this degree make sense in the long run?

246,2018-8-10,2018,8,10,3,95z55u,How do you do exploratory analysis without a GUI?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/95z55u/how_do_you_do_exploratory_analysis_without_a_gui/,esoremada,1533840011,"I've read a lot that you ""can't do data science in a GUI"". Well I don't consider myself an expert data scientist, but I am in a large company doing data analysis on manufacturing data, and 99% of our work is done in GUI programs like JMP or in-house analysis software that integrates with data extraction.

I am trying to learn Python and fit it into my workflow, but for the vast majority of my exploratory data analysis when I use Python I keep thinking ""I could do this 100 times faster in my GUI software"". Am I doing everything wrong? Or does anyone else feel that this way? 

I understand the appeal of Python for routine automation, but for exploratory analysis which is mostly one-off actions I can't stand it. In Python I find myself constantly copy pasting things into my code which feels slow messy. Plotting, reshaping data, filtering, those are all actions that I do hundreds of times a day in my GUI by just selecting which action I want to do and dragging in the column names to use from my selected dataset.

Here are some common steps in my GUI workflow compared to Python (apologies for the wall of text)...
  
___
___
___
  
VIEWING COLUMNS:  
- As soon as my data import finishes I see a list of column names that I can scroll through and filter by column name using regex in a search bar. I can rename them, hide them, change their datatype, create calculated columns as functions of other columns, etc. All these actions are just a click away.  
- In Python I would do df.head() or df.columns which prints raw text of hundreds of columns to my console that I'd then have to copy paste from. Renaming or rearranging columns, creating functions of columns, filtering, all require copy pasting from the console back into my code (or manually typing column names which for manufacturing data are unwieldy) as dataframe index arguments.

MANAGING FILES:  
- All imported datasets (hdf5 usually), plots, pivot tables, filters are shown in a navigation pane in hierarchical folders where I can drag things around. Any time I want to view, reshape, plot, modify, filter or aggregate data I just select which dataset I want to do that for by left clicking it. Filters, plots, aggregation actions, pivots, all exist as files so if I make one I can copy paste it into another folder where it will be applied to the dataset in that folder.  
- In Python all datasets I'm working with are either held in RAM or I have to copy paste the file path (or type it out) in my code. Same for saving files. If my code crashes all variables in RAM that I have reshaped or filtered or aggregated are lost, so it's best to save to a file at each step. That's a lot of copy pasting file paths into Python code which I find very tedious. To view my files I go to Windows explorer, where moving or renaming anything will break my code.  
  
RESHAPING:  
- In my GUI if I want to aggregate or pivot a dataset I just click the button and it brings up a dialog where I can search for column names using regex (the list updates in real time as I'm typing the regex) and then drag one or multiple columns to be a key (group by) or data column (where I select what type of aggregation I want to apply from a drop down menu).  
- Doing this kind of thing in Python kills me. I have to do df.columns, then apply some regex to the list and print the result to the console. Then for each column I want aggregated I have to copy paste it back into my code one at a time as dataframe index arguments, putting quotation marks around each column name and separating with commas. Then I have to type out the groupby code and copy paste the key columns there using the same process.   

PLOTTING:  
- I can select from a list of around 30 plot types including scatters, bars, heatmaps, paretos, etc. And for each one I get a custom dialog that lets me drag and drop X, Y columns as well as categorical columns to color code, partition into multiple plots by value, or cluster x-axis values, and then I get the plot shown to me and put in the navigation folder along with the dataset file. All plots, datasets and filters are shown in a navigation pane in hierarchical folders. I can copy or move those to other folders containing other datasets (assuming the same column titles exist) and see the same plot for those just by reopening it.  
- In Python, again, print column names, find what I want and copy paste them into my code as arguments on the dataframe index and seaborn functions. Reusing anything means copy pasting blocks of code and modifying manually typed dataset or filepath names.     
  
FILTERING:  
- I can use any column to create a filter just by right clicking and selecting filter, on categorical columns I instantly get a list of checkboxes (or a drop down menu, or search menu if I choose) on which I can dynamically toggle values to filter out. On numerical columns it defaults to filtering to a range of values where I choose the min/max. I can create many filters like this and see them listed, and toggle them on and off or modify them, and combine them using boolean logic. All plots in the same folder as this filter+dataset will get updated as I adjust the filters.  
- In Python I have to find the column name I want to filter on, print value_counts to see the possible values in the console. Then I have to copy paste the column name into my code (like for everything else), then copy paste each value I want filtered like df[df['column'] == value] for every single goddamn value I want to consider. This is about 50 times more work than right click -&gt; ""filter"" -&gt; click checkbox beside the values I don't want. And this is something I do hundreds of times a day.

The Library is developed at the **New York University and**  has been publicly released on \*\*July 2018.\*\*The library provides access  to machine learning algorithms,task and models in the browser,  building on top of  [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)with no other external dependencies.So, It can be compared to Keras. [**ML.js**](https://ml5js.org/) is built over [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)and it uses the functionality of [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)at the backend but makes life easier for people who are new to Machine Learning arena.

[**ML.js**](https://ml5js.org/) is built with a Motive to simplify things out for beginners. We can compare this to [Keras](https://keras.io/).  The Motivation behind Keras was to make ML/DL in python so Simple that  it can be used by Beginners. Similar is the case with ML.js..

This  is possible by making a wrapper around the Tensorflow.js library and  use all the functionality at the backend. So Intuitively, It is an Easy  to use API for TensorFlow.js.

## Getting Started withML.js

We can use [**ML.js**](https://ml5js.org/) by  Referencing the [latest version](https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js) of it in our project, by just using a script tag in an HTML file as below:

    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Getting Started&lt;/title&gt;
    
               &lt;script src=""https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    
        &lt;/head&gt;
       &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
           // Your code will go here
         &lt;/script&gt;
       &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

Thats all! 

You are ready to go..

## Promises and Callbacks

[**ML.js**](https://ml5js.org/) supports both **error-first callbacks** and Promises in all methods.

## Using Callbacks

**ML.js** uses a pattern referred to as an **error-first callback**:

**For example** if you are using the \*\*imageClassifier()\*\*method, you will need to construct it in the following way:

    // Pass a callback function to constructor   
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', function(err, model) {        
    
         console.log('Model Loaded!');     
     
    }       
    
    // Make a prediction with the selected image and pass a callback function with two arguments   
    classifier.predict(image, function(err, results) {       
     
         // Check for errors. If no errors, then do something with the results       
    
    });

Error first callbacks is a convention common to many JavaScript libraries that is implemented in **ML.js**. The language JavaScript itself does not enforce this pattern. Before implementation, we need to understand that most **ML.js** methods and functions are asynchronous ( *because machine learning models can take significant amounts of time to process inputs and generate outputs!).* 

## Using Promises

[**ML.js**](https://ml5js.org/) also supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If no callback is provided to any asynchronous function then a Promise is returned.

With Promises, the image classification example can be used in the following way:

// No callback needs to be passed to use Promises.

    ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet')     
      .then(classifier =&gt; classifier.predict(image))    
      .then(results =&gt; {     
           
           // Do something with the results        
     });

## Image Classification UsingML.js - An Example Casestudy

## imageClassifier()

**ML.js**  can use neural networks to recognize the content of images.  ml5.imageClassifier()is a default method to create an object that  classifies an image using a pre-trained models like MobileNet etc.

The **ML.js** library accesses these model from the cloud.

**Let us build a concrete example:-**

We will use the p5 Library along with **ML.js.** p5 is a Powerful yet simple library to use in Javascript.You can find more details [here.](https://p5js.org/) You can always use Vanilla JavaScript or other frame works of your choice with [**ML.js.**](https://ml5js.org/)

Before we start with the Javascript part,We will need to host a local server using NodeJS.

**Below is the Code:-**

    let express = require(""express"");  
    let app = express();  
         
    app.use(function(req, res, next){    
          console.log(`${new Date()} - ${req.method} reqest for ${req.url}`);    
         next();  
     }); 
          
    app.use(express.static(""../local""));      
     
    app.listen(8081, function(){   
          console.log(""Serving at 8081"")   
    });

After the Local server is Successfully up and Running, We can start off with the coding of HTML and JS files.

# My Take onML5.js

This is excellent for coders who are familiar with JavaScript &amp; HTML and are trying to find their way in the ML/DL world!

It  makes things a lot simpler for people coming from a non-ML/DL  background, but who are looking to understand this field.It makes  machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative  coders, and students.

The use cases for this are many, and I personally think its something we need at the moment.

I recently graduated with a bachelor's in physics, but now I want to change my field. I'm from India, if that matters.

I've found data analytics interesting and I would like to pursue a career in it. I understand that this might sound a bit naive coming from someone with very little programming experience (a touch of Python, and a bit of experience with C++ in my final-year thesis), but it does look like something I would find engaging enough to not lose interest, as well as something I could be good at.

I've looked into joining institutes near where I live that offer 'complete' programs, but they *may* not be feasible (still looking into it). In any case, I do have at least a year's worth of time (more, if necessary) on my hands to do nothing but study at home. I've attempted to create a list of topics that I've come across, and would like some input. They're compiled from the brochures of the institutes I've visited, as well as some research on the internet over the past couple weeks. I'll mostly be studying from online resources (that I'll have to find) but if necessary I can look for classes for specific subjects. **I would like to know what I actually need to learn thoroughly, from the following list**.

* Statistics and probability (duh)
* Python (Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn/whatever else) / R - syntax, predictive modelling, neural networks, regression analysis, bayesian network models, decision trees, SVMs, NLP, data/text mining, etc.) 
* SQL 
* Excel (macros/pivot tables/etc)
* SAS
* SPSS
* Tableau

I've not include some of the things from the various brochures, such as Spark and Hadoop as those were not listed everywhere but if they're necessary then I'll have to learn that too. I've been told IRL to study programming in C++ and Java alongside as well, since I don't come from a programming background, to generally get better. Ultimately, I want to get work as a data analyst and keep learning more on the job, to improve my skill-set and advance.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",4,1

Background: we send out a lot of mail. Certain subsets of customers respond positively to the mail while others arent necessarily motivated by it. I want to find pockets of customers based on demographics and buying behavior that we could cut mailing from. 

Data: we have experimental data where 50% of people received communication via direct mail + email while others just received email. 

Desired output: weve found little difference in sales for demographic ABC whether they did or did not receive direct mail. Therefore its safe to cut their mailing.

Long-winded approach 1: running t-test where i split by all different demographics. Example: grab all &lt;25 year olds and run a t test on sales between those who did and did not receive a direct mail piece. If there isnt a huge difference - then cut mail to this group. 

Multi-step approach 2: run log regression to predict those thatll shop, then use a regression method on those predicted to shop to see which demographic variables are inconsequential. To be honest I feel like Im throwing darts blind with this method... and Im not sure exactly how Id frame it up. 

Are there any other ideas on how Id basically answer the question - where can I cut mailing while minimizing risk? Knowing that I have an extensive data set of experiments conducted where folks randomly did or did not receive mailing and we tracked their sales over the course of the campaign. Its as if I almost need to find the most inconsequential variables.

For background information, the data science related math courses I have taken are Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics, and am taking Intro to Statistical Learning in this last semester.

Side Note: I am just looking for a topic and how it relates to data science. I am not looking for a whole syllabus. I just plan on making a syllabus for each good topic and presenting them to the appropriate professors at my university.",4,3

I'm currently finishing up my Math PhD. I've realised academia isn't for me, so I'm looking at industry, in particular Data Science / ML positions. I'm currently trying to work on my programming skills (having done a bit at undergrad, but not so much recently), as well as my stats skills, and learning about Machine Learning / Data Science.

Learning Python seems like the most obvious first step, and I've almost finished the ""Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science"" on Udemy, but I'm not finding it that useful in terms of picking up in-depth knowledge; I find the exercises a bit too ""copy and paste"". Is Dataquest a good next step? The syllabus looks pretty comprehensive, and I've heard that the Python exercises require you to make the algorithm yourself before using pre-made packages, which sounds ideal for really understanding them (I expect being able to properly explain &amp; compare algorithms would be a massive plus at interview).

Also, is it also worth learning another language in addition to Python? C++ seems to appear fairly often in job ads, and I feel like having recent experience in both a low-level and a high-level language will boost my programming skills &amp; my profile. But on the other hand, I feel like I may be better off just focusing on Python so I can build a portfolio &amp; get a job sooner.

Until recently, I've been hesitant to learn about multi-indices in Pandas, since it seemed like just an extra level of complexity on top of everything else. However, I've been reading about them and they seem quite useful. I had several questions about them:

1. What are some good rules of thumb for which columns should be designated as columns, and which as indices? It seems to me that any columns containing information that contain identifying information for data (e.g., subject name, experiment name, etc.), rather than the data itself, should always be designated as indices, and ideally you should have a set of indices that is collectively sufficient to uniquely index each observation. By contrast, columns should contain the data itself (e.g., subject's response on a given trial) Additionally, indices should never be information that you want to perform operations over (e.g., taking the mean); they should only be used as aids for quick lookup, assignment, and groupby operations. Is this roughly correct?
2. Are there any benefits to hierarchal column labels (i.e., when you have multiple layers of column labels on top of the dataframe when you view it) besides personal naming preference? There doesn't seem to be an obvious advantage to me to having the hierarchal column label like ('prefrontal\_cortex','mean\_activation') vs. a flat column label like 'prefrontal\_mean', besides as a personal organizational aid if you so choose.
3. Finally--I've been toying around with doing groupby operations, trying it with grouping by columns vs grouping by those same columns reformatted as indices. I \*thought\* it'd be faster as indices, since the whole point of indexing is to get the fast lookup times. But instead, I'm finding that it's roughly the same speed for small-to-medium dataframes, only yielding substantial gains for huge dataframes (30% boost for a dataframe with 4 million rows). Is this typical, or are there ways to further boost performance?

I wanted to post this here because I think this sub is hilarious and what I designed will resonate with your market. I'm a developer/engineer by trade. Building risk management and data processing services which use machine learning and A.I. to interpret massive amounts of data in realtime to look for trends, patterns, and anomalies. I work with many data scientitist to build these networks and process billions bits of data for the fintech space. Having just deployed a new risk management platform I've noticed much more new cheap/simple technology has entered the market and it would allow for me to create a prototype on this for super cheap. I'm hoping to get everyone's feedback on this and maybe find some friends to help me churn it out.

The problem I want to solve is the recent problems with Fake News ooccurring on both the left and the right. There needs to be an open source model accessible to everyone which is owned by the users which follows a formula in order to promote not fake news, but real news. All the other companies that do this does it as a business and since they need click content they like to take a person stand on the currrent events to appeal to their user base. I want to avoid that by not condemning fake news, but anonymizing real news and ranking it into an easy to consume news feed that's open source and free of adwords, owners, investors, stake holders.

I started doing some digging for a minute and that turned into an entire day. It's actually fairly doable. Here's the components of it and how to achieve the results needed. Here's the fundamental design and development structure of it along with the business model. Please let me know if there's anything out there that's similar, free, not owned by anyone but the users. I'll keep this brief unless everyone thinks r/datascience can build this for the world.

&gt;What to Do: Provide a totally unbiased and anonymous news feed to people that analyzes and ranks the top events of the day/week/month/year from 1 to 100 on facts and importance to you baseed on your user behavior and residence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Where to Play: Digitally. Entire bare bones app provided for free to users on mobile. Also provides a RSS feed for organizations to display in a form field.  
&gt;  
&gt;How to Win: Deliver only factual information to the users using a publicly available formula and data gathering models. Don't make it a business. No financial influences. Only report what is a fact coming from a primary resource.Provide a paper trail for each article so people can see how the platform responded. 

Basically I want to turn the news into a machine. Similar to the 50s. Who, What, Where, When, Why. Its true because the machine said so. It will be hard to do because it can never turn a profit, no one entity owns it, no one works for it. Data Driven News. Peter Thiel can't fund it. Donations are anonymous. Everyone gets to vote on new features and functionality. The machine operates according to an open source code base and a operational policy. To the layman...a constitution. This needs to happen before someone like a Elon Musk does it makes tons of money. Then again you can't.

Before I share how we can do this on the cheap and keep it simple. Let me know if I should continue with the features/functionality and specs.",10,7

I am aware that most data analyst/scientist positions demand services related to data wrangling, web scraping, and data management, which is something I am fine with doing. It also seems that I would need enough work experience or a Ph.D. to gain enough trust to begin tackling these problems.

My summarized qualifications are given as follows:
* M.S. in Mathematics from a public university
* Completed a data science bootcamp and took a handful of MOOCs
* Currently working with a software company for almost a year - work primarily focused on maintaining databases, understanding software infrastructure, and web development
* A few uncompleted projects published on my GitHub (only one completed project)
* A published research paper in pure mathematics during undergraduate

With these above qualifications, I have been relatively unsuccessful in obtaining interview offers from jobs demanding a Bachelor's degree and one year of experience. I believe that there are a lot of reasons behind this:

* I think having uncompleted projects on GitHub is unattractive. I have goals on finishing them on my spare time.
* A lot of the roles that I would ideally work for require a Ph.D. I am aware that a Ph.D. isn't necessary for data science, but I want to have the accessibility to utilize state of the art algorithms in my work. I am reconsidering going back to school for a Ph.D. for this reason, but I'm still unsure about it.
* I am unsure on how to network properly, both on LinkedIn and in-person. I would like to ask for some tips to improve my networking skills.
* I am also unsure on which industry I want to devote my data analytics services to. How can I narrow my search so that my interest aligns well with the goals of a company for a specific industry?

Given the above circumstances, how should I go about finding entry into the analytics field? I feel pretty bummed overall so far with my transition from academia to data science, and I want to reach out for some tips or advice from those who experience something similar.

I'm studying CS and I have a strong interest in data and economics. I'm trying to construct a learning path and I'm running into a wall with the ""learning paradox,"" (a fun term to google). My application for data science is more academic than business oriented, and I can't seem to find basic resources on research methods using data science.

So that all leads me to the most basic question: What category of science does data science fit into?

What I really need is a term for the research methods so that I can find some resources to actually LEARN them. Alternatively, if anyone has wonderful resources to that end I would be eternally grateful for your wisdom!",4,4

Human eyes can easily capture information and images by numbers and numbers. However, most business intelligence reports for senior management often publish in financial tables and charts that those who see it are not clearly described. On the contrary, the image viewer allows users to learn more about business and business conditions. Data relating to those who are responsible for deciding the relationship between types of information and providing new ways to translate data using a thermal map, charts, and other graphics.

**2. Quick access to business information**

Access to image information increases the ability of business organizations to access the information they need when they need it, and to make them more effective in other companies. According to a recent opinion poll, business managers using organizations that have access to information are more accessible to more than 28 percent of more relevant information than information and control fields. In addition, 48 percent of business intelligence users using the accessibility feature can access the necessary information without having a great access to IT staff.

**3. Good details of business and business activities**

The key benefits of an information feature are how to enable users to dramatically improve performance between business conditions and the business environment. In today's highly valued companies, access to information has never been so important. For example, by offering different insights into the functioning of high-performance businesses and executives, as soon as the first call to a remote call center that affects customer satisfaction.

By using data, businesses can provide a wealth of information that can easily understand how fun, up-to-date issues, financial issues, or policy issues are. It includes a deeper vision that can lead to a good decision and an immediate step of business if necessary.

**10. View specific data**

Another important advantage of data quality is that we do not only pay data graphical databases, but also allow you to modify the form, remove unnecessary and continue with the details. This is a great eye and attracts attention to business operations better and provides better communication. It also offers many multidisciplinary methods for presenting data.

In short I'll be graduating in business economics soon and I want to work as a datascientist / data engineer at a company like Booking, Spotify or Airbnb. These companies often look for people with a certain degree of experience. I have a good general knowledge of the domain as I have taken a online courses, read books, etc... But doing those is easy since the level of hand-holding is usually pretty high. I currently work at a company as a student where I do a lot of data cleaning with python. I do encounter problems during work, but nothing some intensive trying or googling won't solve. 

I considered doing a one year master's in datascience. But it's an advanced master, which requires me to already have a master. I can't start this master since I won't already have a laster since I missed the deadline for my thesis. I'm from Belgium, so finding a job without a master diploma is possible when the only thing you have to do is submit your thesis. 

I'm good at teaching myself, but having an experienced teacher does so much to speed up the learning process. Now I  stumbled upon Datascience Bootcamps through [switchup](https://www.cio.com/article/3051124/careers-staffing/10-boot-camps-to-kick-start-your-data-science-career.html). What are your opinion on these? 

\*\* About Bootcamps \*\*

I have a bias against Bootcamps. Most bootcamps are expensive. I feel like the only added value is to have mentorship and some networking afterwards. Otherwise these bootcamps follow the same  structure. Their descriptions are pretty similar too and seeem to focus on the basics of python or of tensorflow or this or that. I feel like it's a lot of focus on the basics. SHouldn't i learn some advanced stuff? I don't want to learn the syntax of a language.

What are the caveats to the no job then money back guarantee?

On the other hand bootcamps could offer a lot of experience and fill that empty portfolio of mine. Do the cost weigh the benefits? Their offers are all similar and all sound too good to be true. And when it's sounds like it, it usually is. 

So what am I overlooking?

Have any of you done bootcamps? What was your experience during the camp? How did the job search and subsequent interviews go? Once you got a job did you have a severe case of the impostor's syndrome? 

Also, when you give your opinion could your street cred? Being reddit after, it would help to understand from where your opinion stems. 

\*\*Tldr: \*\*

I know what to do when working on a project, it takes a long time to translate it into code because of my lack of experience. Can I get hired like this or will a bootcamp be worth the cost?",3,3

I am totally willing to make the time and money investment in something like a bootcamp and I have the means to do full-time training, but I don't want to do this if there is a better, faster way to get into the industry. 

What I really want to know is what can I do that will get me a job in the field ASAP? Is there some specific bootcamp that will make this happen? If so - - what are the best bootcamps? Or some particular tech skill I could learn that would basically guarantee that I'm hireable very soon? If I something like learned Microsoft SQL server or Tableau and given my other skills, would this be likely to get me hired?

I've been looking into bootcamps like Thinkful, Springboard, and Data Application Lab. The concern I have about these is actually that I already know a lot of the stuff they teach and I'm worried that these will be a waste of time and not elevate me to where I want to be.

Since last April, I've taught myself Python, SQL, and some R at usable (non-production) levels, and I've learned how to design dashboards in Tableau to a semi-professional level. I've taken many MOOCs, and used Dataquest to learn the languages, and am currently in a Stats MOOC that has made me love Stats again. Also, 4 months ago, I quit my accounting job and got hired to be a Business Analyst at a pharma company, and I design in Tableau on a daily basis. I plan on becoming QA certified in Tableau in the coming months. Other important thing to know about me - I'm living in DC, so almost every program is out of state.

**What I'm looking for:** Well, I'm still figuring it out, obviously. MOOC's are nice and fun, but they don't count for anything in the long run. So I am looking for a program that will provide me with the math &amp; CS background I need (and currently don't have) to have a real chance at developing a professional career as a Data Scientist - or at least a data analyst working on modeling and statistical research projects, akin to some of the pieces produced by Pew Reasearch, Data for Progress, etc.

**Where I'm at in my Search:** I have discovered some programs that appeal to me - 

* NC State's MSA in Analytics - this appeals to me because of the proven track record of successful job placement, as well as the curriculum. i have no doubt that this would be worth the out-of-state tuition rate I would have to pay in the long run. I would study exactly what i want to study, and would have a degree from a proven program to show for it. I don't like that it's a taught with SAS language.
* GA Tech's Analytics masters - This appeals on price as well as the ability to complete online. I haven't found any online programs that either have the chops to back up the price or have a proven record of success. This GA tech program is new but the curriculum is in line with what I want to learn, and the price is right. Other GA tech programs similar to this one are highly reviewed so I would trust it would be a good choice. 
* Stanford's MS in Statistics with Data Science concentration - I've looked at this briefly but doubt I'd be truly competitive for Stanford despite above average college grades.(and I don't want to take the GRE if I can help it)

I'm also still trying to decide whether it's more beneficial to try an Analytics/Data Science program or stick to pure statistics - would these accomplish similar ends? Besides that, **I'm looking for other programs similar to the one's here which I haven't come across yet but would be strong alternatives to consider. Online is a Plus, Low cost is a Plus, proven job placement is a plus.**

What I did: 

I created a program in Microsoft visual studio that daily calls to the slack web api using zappyssys  to return a list of conversations, users, etc.(where the first bullet comes from). From there I wrote C# programs that converted unix epox times to EST and added missing columns of data to the return of the slack api. Then, I created a producer, consumer, and neutral data model in qlik sense; so that I had all of the desired functionality when creating analytics(where the second bullet comes from). Finally I built analytics though the usage of graphs in qlik sense that displayed and diagnosed the data (the 3rd bullet). 

Why I don't like this:

I feel like it reads like a list and is far too in depth, along with awkward phrasing and the potential to sound like I have no idea what I am talking about. 

Potential Changes:

1. I could turn bullet one and two into one bullet point so it would read like this:
designed and build an automated data gathering program from which I cleaned the data and created a functional model
1. If there is a well know high level process that includes the data gathering, cleaning, and data model creating step I could just include all of these bullets in that process
1. Change the phrasing to make it sound more professional 
1. Leave it alone because I am over thinking everything

Thanks to those of you who have made it this far, it means a lot to have people out there who want you to succeed. Once again if you guys have any questions for me I would be happy to help.

First post here :)

I'm currently in the process of learning R and STATA on my own. I was wondering if there was any place where I could see the code for a full data analysis project? From like, building the data set to cleaning the data set and then the various analyses done. If possible, something in the social sciences that focuses on experiments or experimental design would be great. 

Is there anything like that? Or perhaps a YouTube Channel where someone goes through the complete cycle of a data analysis project? If so, I'd love to find something like this :)

Thanks! ",2,4

I'm a high schooler and am interested in learning data science. I know there are a plethora of resources out there to learn, but I'm finding it tough to decide on a curriculum. I'm sure many of you have a lot more experience than I do, so I wanted to ask for some advice.

I've been searching for a little while and through the overwhelming number of results I've found a few curricula that seem viable. These are the [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-data-science-curriculum/) and [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) ones. But, as I said before, I'm not sure which courses are useful and if there are any others I should be taking.

Here's a little bit about my current state. In terms of math, I will be taking AP Calculus BC and AP Statistics this year. I think (not completely sure though lol) that I have a strong understanding of the concepts I've learned so far, but I know that some aspects of data science require knowledge of higher level math, so maybe that should be part of my curriculum. Moving onto programming, I've completed [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) from MIT on edX and am almost done with [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) from Harvard on edX. I'm pretty familiar with Python and C and have some knowledge of HTML, SQL, and JavaScript.

My schedule is relatively flexible. I'd say I can put in 15 hours per week, although this may change once the school year starts. I have no clue if this is reasonable, but my goal is to be able to do an actual project by early 2019. So, please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions. Literally any advice, whether or not its relevant and complete, would be super helpful, since I'm pretty lost. Thank you so much in advance!",5,6

I recently wanted to to a personal project but I'm struggling with articulating exactly what I need for something like Google to give me relevant results to learn from.


I'll try explaining as simply as I can.



I have 100 different objects, each of these objects has 10 distinct characteristics.



These 10 characteristics are fields with numerical values, say field one can be either [1,2,3] while field two can be [1-20] etc...



These objects can share values with other objects but must be unique, no two objects can have the exact same set.


These 100 objects all have some determined price, and are all priced 'fairly', meaning that their price is dependent only on the values of their 10 different characteristics.



If I know the prices of some of these values, for example three objects share the same values except field one, and I see that [2]'s are cost ""5"" more than [1]'s, and ""5"" less than [3]'s, is there a way for me to deduce the cost value for each of the 10 fields? Say that I were to make object 101 with me personally inputting the values of the 10 characteristics I should be able to know the total cost of this new object.


What would be the most effective way of going about this?",1,1

I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6znbdo/data_analyst_one_month_in/) about a my background and a little bit about my job. 

In the past year, I have been promoted from analyst I to analyst II and have been accepted to GT analytics program, which my company has agreed to pay for 70% of tuition and 100% of other fees, while working full time.

I work for a natural gas company and continue to do marketing analytics. In my first year, I have gotten very very very familiar with SQL, and cleaning lots and lots of data (shout out tidyverse). I am lucky enough that my team is small and my work requires me to go from pulling the data, to cleaning the data, to ultimately building a model if necessary. 

There are certain things that I have learned through out my year as an analyst 

* Ask questions. Often if you don't know what is going on with the data someone else does. People tend to be helpful especially when you are starting out. 

* Assume the model you built is too good to be true if you are getting some amazing results. Often times there is some data leakage issue that you did not see immediately, but your skepticism will help you catch that. 

* Build things because there is a dollar amount associated with the knowledge created from your analysis. Nobody cares that you have a cool ML algorithm if it does not save or make the company any money. 

* Always have a simple baseline model to compare more complex models to. Losing easily interpreted coefficients should not be taking lightly. How much more accuracy is worth losing that occasional more actionable insight?

* Get comfortable with SQL, like really comfortable and be prepared to clean data and write views for other people... 

* Comment and version control your code. Bitbucket, github, vsts or whatever you use is your friend. 

* Create pipelines to help with reproducible work. Shout out [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). 

Ask to help others on their projects and please please learn about the company, the business' needs, and goals before building some crazy model. Often times a simple approach is just as good as a black box ML model (not saying all the time). Overall my year as an analyst has been great and I have been fortunate enough to have a boss that is hands off and is willing to take the fall for my mistakes. I am looking forward to learning more about data engineering and going to transition into a sort of in between analyst and data engineer role.",38,132

I intend to apply for a Masters in the USA and I want to become a data scientist. However I am having trouble deciding which master program to apply to, here are my options:

- MS in CS: would let me take courses in areas which I havent studied in my undergrad (like computer architecture, information theory and functional programming). However, I also feel like I know enough CS to become a data scientist and I already took most courses related to data science anyways (ie. Introduction to AI, databases, algorithms etc).

- MS in stats: would give me a more theoretical background for data science. However, I am not very interested in theoretical statistics and the fact that I barely passed on probability course last semester lowers my chances of admission to a good program (although I am taking a course in statistical tests right now and I am planning to do well in it)

- MS in data science: is kind of new, which means that the industry havent seen much of those degrees. However, they are mostly focused in what I want.

While most rankings are based on lifetime citations, faculty tenure and promotion decisions and university budget dollars are increasingly driven by the number of publication in top journals in recent years. Our system rewards the most currently productive researchers and identifies whom is most likely to be a top citation ranking in the future. We thus developed a ranking system based purely on the number of publications economics faculty have had over the previous four years in the five top economics journals.

Ranking Methodology

We identified every publication in five top economics journals published in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. We identified the five top economics journals from the Journal Citation Reports journal impact score and chose the five economics journals with the highest impact score. To confirm use of these journals in tenure and promotion evaluations, we also reviewed the journal lists used in multiple University Economics Departments to evaluate faculty productivity, tenure, and promotion. The five journals used for our 2018 Top Economics Professor ranking were *Econometrica, Journal of Economic Literature, Journal of Economics, Journal of Political Economy,* and *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*.

Results

Our analysis found there were 1,323 economists that published articles in these five journals between 2014 and 2017. Of these 1,323 authors, just 172 economists had two or more top tier journal publications, and only 39 had three or more publications. Of the most productive economics professors, nine published four article and only two professors: Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Xavier Gabiax of Harvard University had five publications. Because first authors are generally recognized as having provided a greater intellectual contribution to the journal article, we examined the number of first author publications versus publications where the author was second or higher in the list of authors. We used this number as tie breaker between the top two published economics journal authors and recognized Professor Acemoglu with five first authored publications the Top Economics Professor of 2018. Professor had two first authored journal article publications.

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this. I'm happy to share more in-depth discussion of my skills and experience in the comments. This is mostly for catharsis over an increasingly frustrating job hunt, but I'm hoping for some good discussion. In particular: 

1. Am I Data Scientist? What sorts of roles should I be looking for? 
2. Are my salary expectations reasonable? What is reasonable, given my experience and knowledge? 
3. What are the best things in particular I could focus on to increase my desirability in the marketplace for jobs?
4. Any insight into the job markets in the Northeast? Types of growing industries in the region that might fit my interests would be helpful. 

**Who I am**

I am a 34 year old data ""scientist"" in Dallas, TX-- it's what my job title is, but it's often hard to consider myself as such. I started at my current company as a data analyst, working with messy external HR data and (equally messy) internal data. I went ABD in graduate school in a fairly quantitative political science program, but did not finish for a number of reasons.

When I started as an HR data analyst, my work mainly revolved around using Excel (vlookups and pivot tables), with the occasional large project that I would need to complete on Stata (which I mainly worked on in grad school). Since then, mostly based on prodding from me and a couple of other guys on our team, we have transitioned to using R, which I've become fluent in. 

Nearly all of the learning was on my own time: I enrolled in online courses, spent my own time going through books, and have devoted nights and weekends to learning. I've spent some time learning Python as well and, while I don't work in it on a daily basis, I'm confident that I could quickly ramp up to running analyses as needed in pandas/numpy pretty quickly if needed. I'm okay in SQL--again, mostly because I don't use it on a consistent basis--and can run what I would guess are intermediate queries. 

On the analysis front, I generally conduct regression/logistic regression when needed; however, I have conducted factor analyses, random forest, and some other techniques in online courses and understand the intuition and programming behind them. However, my understanding of the math is limited, but it is something I'm trying to work on. 

**Problems in my current role**

*Lack of growth*: There are definite limitations on my ability to continue growing where I'm at, and I've been bumping up against them for awhile. More advanced analytics are not in the cards at my current role and there's limited room for growth. I'm not particularly interested in the problems that we are dealing with. 

*Salary*: I don't think my salary has kept pace with my growing skills--it's probably not worthy of six figures, but I feel like it's more than the 70k I am making. 

*Lack of interest*: I would love to do something that relates to my interest in politics. However, looking at the types of data science jobs that are available in DC and the associated salaries makes me cringe, considering the massive cost of living differences from where I am now. I would be content with other options, however, and try to volunteer when/where I can to satiate that. 

*Location*: I grew up in the Northeast and all of my family are still there. My grandparents are getting older and may not have much time left, so I have a lot of guilt about being far away without having much opportunity to see them. I would like to be back in the Northeast US--preferably in Philly, but anywhere between Boston and DC would be fine. 

**Problems with my job hunt**

I get fairly frequent calls from recruiters on LinkedIn-- at least a couple per month. They all fizzle out, and it seems for various reasons and at various stages. I'm frequently recruited within my current area, but I'm not very interested in staying here long-term. I haven't gotten any good feedback, only ""they found better candidates."" 

Another big hindrance seems to be the ever-changing mishmash of technology and techniques that go into ""data science."" When I started learning R, the Holy Grail seemed to be R, Python, and SQL: now, I often see Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra, Java, etc. The further I go down that path, though, the further I move away from the questions that got me caring about data in the first place (politics specifically, humans in general).

I did some searching on different threads for situations similar to mine, but would also like some specific opinions.

Background: I graduated from a decently prestigious university for undergrad with a dual degree in Psychology and Applied Mathematics. I then got an entry level data analyst job for the experience but would like to graduate to data scientist/further in the future. Currently I am also teaching myself Python through DataQuest and the likes (also potentially builds up portfolio). I'm learning a ton of SQL and other visual programs such as VS in my first year at work.

Dilemma: Now that I've gotten used to the work environment and not to mention my company is willing to pay for *some* tuition, I feel like I have a great opportunity to pursue a masters as well. This would have to be online as I have no plans to stop working full-time and my local colleges don't offer programs to suit. My question (and interests) narrowed down is, CS or Applied Statistics? My ultimate career goal is to do something with machine learning. I understand ideally you need both subjects, but I'm ganna have to pick one/self learn the other as much as I can it looks like.

For CS, I've narrowed my #1 option to Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, which I had to double take at the $7k price tag. What a great price for (to the best of my knowledge) a great program, that even lets you specialize in machine learning.

For Applied Stats, I've also narrowed down the online options to Penn State's program. There are other schools, but they are either more expensive (PSU is ~25k for the degree) or their course offerings do not seem as great/interesting to me, or both. I feel like I'd like every one of the courses that PSU offers. I am not interested in a pure MS in statistics because I just don't love the theoretical aspects of it, especially in-depth, and I'd rather do one of the others that I'm more interested in.

My thoughts: 
With this not being the first time CS vs. stats is mentioned, there is obviously no objective winner. I feel like in this case, with my current state and picks, I'd be better off choosing CS? GT's program has a specialization in ML, which is my end goal anyway. Plus, if all else was equal, 7k vs 25k is a no brainer. However, I have also heard that stats is harder to ""self-teach"" and a strong foundation is required. Would the statistics courses in a ML oriented CS program be enough? 

Convince me whichever way! Thank you!

Hello everyone,

If this needs to be posted elsewhere please let me know!

**TL;DR :**  I have gained new skills from my normal WFM Analyst position. I have been querying data that was never easily accessible since no one in our whole department has had the chance to learn how to do it. The bullet list below shows my current job duties. I would like to see what job position I should be classified under based on those skills and if I should be compensated more for what I have contributed to my department and company.

**Long Story:** I'm not new to this /r but I created a new account to remain anonymous. I work at a company in Northwest US as a Workforce Analyst for our callcenter. Our company as a whole will be undergoing a compensation evaluation and I wanted to submit my case to management on a potential raise and maybe new position for me to be held in.

This site pretty much entails what my company also views as my job responsibilities: [https://study.com/articles/workforce\_analyst\_salary\_job\_description.html](https://study.com/articles/workforce_analyst_salary_job_description.html)

Recently, I have been doing a-lot more that my typical job duties entail; job duties I have grown to love. Our department an team never really had a Data type role but one of our previous associates had data feeding into Tableau. That data was being consumed for a few years and if anything was wrong, a ticket had to be sent to that associate or one of their colleagues in another department to fix the SQL queries. I started utilizing those existing queries and modifying them to become more accurate and more granular for deep diving. Other sub-departments in our company have started to recognize my abilities and I started receiving more requests for data. Although we have tools provided from our company to obtain certain data, there was a lot of data that was not shown or could not be combined together. The only way they were able to receive this data was from me or another department like Finance or IT.

Our company is going through a data migration and I have been tasked to open a small database for our customer service department. I'm still working on this now, but I am learning a-lot and I'm starting to realize this is going to be a much bigger responsibility than I initially thought. Management is willing teach me the skills necessary to continue doing this, as the data I'm able to retrieve has been very beneficial and we haven't been able to see data like this before.

Going back to the compensation evaluation, I'm trying to see what my job title would be based on the skills that I have learned over the past 2 years. Since my current job profile doesn't match what I'm currently doing at my job, I wanted to make sure I'm heading in the right direction and in the right job position.

**Here is a bullet list of most of my current job duties:**

* Writes SQL queries to store, sort, and retrieve data across multiple tables. Writing and optimizing queries for efficiency and accuracy.
   * Write ad hoc SQL queries to find data based on the requester's needs.
* Using that data to create dashboards and reports and sending them to leadership/supervisors for potential CSR agent coaching.
* Through this, I have learned how to query Oracle DBs with Oracle SQL.
* I am currently migrating our queries to work with Redshift, since that is where our company's data is being migrated over to. 
* Because of this migration, I'm now learning how to utilize AWS Redshift and the basics of cluster creation and maintenance. 
* I'm translating our Oracle SQL queries to Redshift (PostreSQL) which is a difficulty but I'm learning everyday.
* A report I have created with this data is being used in development for an over all metrics dashboard that will replace multiple reports that the upper management will have to look at.

I apologize for the super long post but I'd love to hear some feedback on what my potential job title should be and what I can do to learn and progress further in to data!

My concern is by the time I start implementing ML, the market will have moved on to something else. As we can already see SPSS and other packages offering point and click sales prediction and stuff.

Demo: [http://irool.zenika.com/](http://irool.zenika.com/)

***Guide to the visit: ( the popups you see will be in french but they only explain those steps )***

\- You make a small signup at the beginning ( you dont have to give your real email, anything with an email form will be good)

\- You complete the form ( firstname, lastname, age, gender: **you don't have to give your real names only age and gender are necessary**)

\- You give a **rate** to the interface you see (in number of stars by going to the navigation bar.)

\- You continue to give rate for the next 9 interfaces that will be proposed to you.

\- Once your mission is accomplished, you can sign up and claim your badge of a great user.

**The main question behind this project is:** does personnalization (based on age and gender) really has an impact ?

recently, I have written a Java implementation of the fairly new [Anchors](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf) algorithm. 

However, as the algorithm is highly computation-intensive, I would like to add some performance improvements. 

The algorithm's authors formulate finding the best n-candidates as a multi-armed bandit problem and propose to use the pure-exploration KL-LUCB algorithm. 

As the evaluation consists of both repeated perturbation of the inspected instance and subsequent evaluation by the means of a provided model, this is where definitely most resources are being consumed. When an instance gets perturbed, all features not specified by the candidate may get changed. After each perturbation has been evaluated by the provided model, the anchor's precision can easily be calculated by relating correct predictions. This is how the best candidates get chosen.

Therefore, I'd like to introduce a parallel/batch pure-exploration multi-armed bandit algorithm to make use of threading. As there are no open-source implementations, yet and I am no mathematician, this haven proven very hard for me. 

I have found an algorithm called [GP-UCB-PE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5350) which sounds promising. However, I am not even sure whether this algorithm may be applied to the problem depicted above.

What would you say is the best way to parallelize the evaluation? Is there any chance to do this at all?

Or how much programming is involved in the process. After studying ML (Introduction to Statistical Learning) and learning some Comp Sci terms and getting algorithm practice, there are some thoughts I had.

-I feel like ML programming really comes down to understanding and transcribing mathematical notation to an algorithm written in a language that will be interpreted the same by a computer. For me this personally is not that difficult, and I really enjoy mathematically notating models to describe business processes

- This next thought gos hand in hand with my last thought. Although it may be easy to transcribe a general ML algorithm, you may need to know the strengths and weaknesses in detail of many ML algos. This will allow you to develop your own algorithms that incorporate elements of many general algorithms to get a ML algorithm best suited for a specific business purpose. This certainly is difficult, and I feel like this more focuses around statistics and math, rather than programming in terms of difficulty.

- I have yet to learn Linear Algebra, so Im going to sound like a doofus sharing this idea. Basically, it seems Linear Algebra is very focused on dealing with matrices in terms of data science applications. I feel like its good to know linear algebra just so you can incorporate the interpretation of matrices into mathematical notation for the sake of brevity. I would like to know what other uses there are for this topic (aside from matrix multiplication of course).

These are just thoughts Ive had through the learning process, and I would really appreciate any clarification so I dont develop any bad perspectives.",16,1

I've gone from an era where we had to transfer large datasets in CSV through FTP and running our models in a remote SAS server to scalable machine learning in the cloud, but the one thing that hasn't changed is the need to translate complex business problems into data problems and then translating them back into useful insights.

I see data scientists fresh out of school who want nothing to do with exploratory data analysis, they want to get to ""building models"". To them, the article has an answer that's phrased much better than I could have.

&gt; These days a great deal of machine learning and deep learning is being automated, as we learned when we dedicated an episode to automated machine learning, and heard from Randal Olson, lead data scientist at Life Epigenetics. One result of this rapid change is that the vast majority of my guests tell us that the key skills for data scientists are not the abilities to build and use deep-learning infrastructures. Instead they are the abilities to learn on the fly and to communicate well in order to answer business questions, explaining complex results to nontechnical stakeholders. Aspiring data scientists, then, should focus less on techniques than on questions. New techniques come and go, but critical thinking and quantitative, domain-specific skills will remain in demand.",40,178

The previous few weeks have been good, and I've been making steady progress in learning about gcloud services and frameworks I didn't use in school. However, I'm at the stage where I need to improve my model, and I feel like 1) I'm blowing money on experiments that haven't amounted to anything 2) running out of ideas to test and 3) have somewhat high expectations from my coworkers in other teams.

I was thinking about this yesterday, but I think I'm not being methodical enough in how I'm setting up my experiments. I've done a research internship before where my supervisor would sit down, do analysis with me, and plan out experiments for me to try, and I'm realizing how much I wish I had that now. My past week has been learning how to use ML Engine and running maybe 20-30 experiments trying different parameters, models, and data distributions to little avail. I feel like I'm sitting in a control room with thousands of buttons that I don't recognize or understand. My plan today is to write out an experiment schedule and take notes on everything. My question is, how do you develop models in a productive way?",5,1

Are there any standards or tools for describing data sets using easy and consistent metadata and then visualizing, organizing, browsing, and navigating through them?

I work for a form that has many large datasets managed in various ways, but have fairly static metadata described using largely project open data [0]. However, I and many team members create small analytical subsets all the time for a particular question or joins or whatnot. They are typically disconnected as the analysis is point in time. Sometimes they are built into database systems like sqlsrver that has it's own metadata and ways to search and describe the set. However, it's usually sas, or R, or csv, or some relatively small file from 100MB to a few gigs. However, this leads lots of difficulty in keeping track, collaborating with co-workers, reusing someone else's work, etc.

Some folks compensate by describing the extracts using datapackages or w3c or whatever individuals choose and storing the file where it can be indexed by an internal search engine (usually SOLR).

I'd like to find an easy or OSS tool that can consistently store metadata and point to the source dataset and allow browsing, searching, visualizing stats like linkages, user activity, etc. But that also works on an individual level to organize personal on individual collections that grow over time.

There are commercial data management products like collibra or socrata has some internal enterprise data products. But they are expensive and require a central install and purchase. I basically want github for data, but can't host externally.

It provided a welcoming introduction to the field; its lessons softened the edges of what, to someone as uninitiated as I was at the time, was an intimidating discipline. Mentors were unusually helpful. The courses seemed guided by a principle that emphasized clear pedagogy above all else, and the somewhat low-rent production value of the videos actually served this purpose. I didn't sign up for sake of earning the credential, but for the quality of the lessons, and I'm not sure I could have found another program that was as structured and effective as it was affordable. It was a terrific launching pad. (My current job involves a combination of data analysis and editorial work.)

I took the DAND in 2017, and at some point that year, something inside the company switched, which I noticed first in the deep learning nanodegree and then in the NLP program, both of which I was so dissatisfied with I dropped out of. Lesson videos were more visually spectacular but also more pedagogically obtuse. Forum mentors were ruder. The assignments we were given were essentially pre-completed Jupyter notebooks that we simply had to run, filling in tiny bits of code here and there (which, because of the obtuse lessons, were difficult to connect back to any particular moment of learning). Costs went up.

I saw today that Udacity launched a Data Science nanodegree, whose curriculum interests me as a way to sharpen my skills on some algorithms that I haven't worked with that much, as well as build more sophisticated data pipelines.  But I'm inhibited from giving them a third shot at this point, unless someone here has rave reviews of the program.

Maybe the degradation was inevitable as Udacity walks the path to Large Public Company, but it's too bad, because I still haven't found another MOOC as satisfying as the DAND was. ",22,26

I am currently attempting to tackle a fairly large project and that is taking my company's existing data and creating some type of formal structure going forward as we begin to actually utilize current and historical information to create product features. This is different from what I'm used to as I've either had a structure given to me to work with or because it was for a personal project I was able to build a structure and pipeline out fairly quickly because It would only be used once.  
 This however will be a standard for other people and parts of a larger application that would be used by a large number of internal staff for data entry.   


The company basically does lowest price match procurement for other companies using a combination of people and rule based automation at the moment. This means the data is a lot of price data, both current and historical as well as a lot of free text with product descriptions, names, urls etc. There is also a lot of date information for things such as when something was purchased and delivery estimation as well as internal time tracking for each step of the order pipeline.

New boss around, not technical at all, but more on the ""consulting side"". Some time ago we developed a small solution to forecast/estimate trends in commodity prices. Not exactly the same as stock market, but very close; the same mathematical properties of the signals. The idea was to have a very approximate and long term view of the trends and the expected average level of prices in +12, +24 months... That was delivered, and everybody happy. 
Now, New Boss sold the idea that we (I!) can predict spot price at a certain date. 
I explained her that it is not possible to do that (at the level of accuracy required), but she insisted and now she expects to see results of everything, from ARIMA or persistence to neural networks. She thinks I am lying or being not proactive. I ran some tests in different technologies to show her that it is not possible to get what he wants, but now the perspective shifted, and now New Boss thinks that the problem is that I am not fine tuning things properly, or working hard enough. 
My mistake: I once said ""sure, I can try and you will see"", but now things are getting worse. She even suggested hiring a new guy just to work on this ""project"". 
I shared with her papers, blog posts, articles, and of course explained her how this works, but in the end, she always end with ""but computers are so powerful! we must be able!""
Now, I'm looking for the most professional way to say no and avoid commitment in things I know I cannot deliver.

All of my knowledge regarding data science comes from two classes. One where we used Kaggle and R to predict values for one dependent categorical value.  We learned some simple statistics like z-score/z-test/permutation test/central limit theorem/bayes conditional probability/p-score. After this I took an intro to AI course where I got interested in machine learning and more bayes stuff/markov stuff.

So I am currently learning python (so much simpler than learning java/c...), but was wondering what other resources/subjects I should learn or look into.

I don't remember much statistics from when I took AP stats in high school. So I am weak there, but not sure what textbook or resources are good... Furthermore, I am not sure how to start once i learned python. I have seen websites like datacamp or dataquest, which seem fun, but I don't know if they are good..

I'm a student at a top-tier school in CS, and I study a mix of computer and cognitive science current, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. In the past, i've done some very basic user analytics and data visualization with Tableau for an internship, and then also did a side project where I used Naive Bayes (just a basic algorithm from my probability course) to try to predict the winner of the 2016 Presidential Election.

I'm now starting a side project where i'm trying to project college acceptance and retention rates nationally for various Asian American and Pacific Islander high school students in 2022. I'm doing this project because it concerns an issue of educational inequity that's present across different APIA demographics, an issue I care deeply about, and I hope to use this data and project to show to my school's administration and maybe even state administration to try to promote change within our admissions policies for certain demographics.

My question is, to approach this specific problem, what are some tools I should keep in mind when starting this project, especially in terms of analytics? I want to start next week, probably beginning by viewing census estimates and cleaning that population data and adjusting it with current immigration estimates to get a vague idea for the APIA high school student population of the United States. From there, i'm not sure what further analysis could be done, i'm thinking of probably running some sort of polynomial regression model based off past population and education data--I have ""Hands on Machine Learning"" from O'Reilly and I want to work what I learn from that book into a regression model for my project.",1,1

I have read a lot of old posts here clearly distinguishing between these two job positions. I am right now at a cross-road where I have admits to 2 different type of programs.

1) **Leading to a career  Business Analytics:** Part Management and Part IT. Has subjects related to Data analytics and training for tools such as SAP, Tableau, etc.

The university is a top 15 in Germany(FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg). The course, however, has 50-60% management subjects.

2) **Leading to a career in Data Science:** Has copious amounts of  maths and usage of data structures and algorithms, which can aid in the field of data science.

The university is not as prominent compared to the previous one, but is situated in Frankfurt(means better opportunities?). This one has lots of maths and algorithm related subjects in it.


I have no aversion towards maths whatsoever, but I was confused on the future career prospects for either of these fields. While Business Analytics seems like a field that has existed for a long time, data science seems to be relatively upcoming field(comparatively?).

This model (model A) gets 85% test accuracy:

This model (model B) gets 95% accuracy:

    padded_input -&gt; conv2d -&gt; batch norm -&gt; relu -&gt; maxpool -&gt; flatten -&gt; FC(sigmoid)(300) -&gt; FC(sigmoid)(1)

However, both of the following models (models C and D) get 50% test accuracy or lower (somehow worse than random guessing):

    padded_input -&gt; conv2d -&gt; batch norm -&gt; relu -&gt; maxpool -&gt; flatten -&gt; FC(relu)(300) -&gt; FC(sigmoid)(1)

The only thing I had changed from model B to models C and D is the activation function on the second-last layer.

When I look at the literature on convnets, it looks like many of the famous image classification convnets have numerous layers of FC(relu) -&gt; maxpool -&gt; FC(relu) -&gt; maxpool -&gt; ... at the end before a final sigmoid or softmax layer.

Why is it that when I try to use a relu function it completely breaks my model and it fails to learn anything? Is there something I am missing here?

Thanks in advance!

technical details:

1. In the model summaries, where I have written FC(relu)(300) that means a fully connected layer with a relu activation function which outputs 300 nodes.
2. The FC(sigmoid)(1) is the final output of the network. It represents the ""probability"" that the person is smiling. If the value is above 0.5 the person is predicted to be smiling.",6,2

&amp;#x200B;

In 2011 I started crawling main stream news websites.   The goal at the time was to of course make money and measure sentiment in order to place stock trades.  I never got very far with THAT idea but the crawler has been going since June 2011.  In that time I've crawled the same 20 news sites every 30 minutes to create ""snapshots"" in time.  

&amp;#x200B;

s1 = 00 - 29

s2 = 30 - 59

&amp;#x200B;

There would be 2 snapshots every hour and the crawler attempts to hit every site in a crawl list every hour inside that window.   For example I have [cnn.com/index.html](https://cnn.com/index.html) every 30 minutes going back to June 2011.   This includes a full color rendered image of the home page and the actual HTML file.

This crawler currently has a ""dashboard"" that allows me to punch in any 30 minute window in time going back to June 2011 and seeing what was on the main pages of all these news sites in a grid.  Some very interesting stuff to say the least. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I woke up and felt driven to refocus on this project and here I am requesting some help or a partner that may be interesting in joining forces to thrash this hay.  

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect there is value here if done right but frankly I'm not sure how to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking a simple thing would be to take all the link titles &lt;a href='url'&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and process them using R tidy, nlp python, lucene/solr, ELK stacks but every time I start to put things together like this it goes over my head fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts or ideas on where to go from here?

I've been writing a lot of high performance libraries that augment or improve existing open source DS libraries and I think releasing them would be beneficial for two reasons: I'd like to give back to the open source community and it would look good on my resume. I'm just not sure how to go about asking for permission to do so at a company which tries to keep everything confidential.  

Thanks in advance for any and all advice.",12,8

I am training a binary classifier to identify pictures of good and bad zippers. The pictures that I am using for this task are being taken from a conveyor belt. I have around 8000 pictures of which 4400 are of good zippers.

One important factor to consider, is that when I was constructing this dataset, I would take 4 pictures every time I passed a zipper through te conveyor belt in order to increase the size of the dataset quickly (I am not sure if this can be the cause to my error)

When I trained the classifier (random forest) using about 30% for testing set I end up getting very high scores in both the training and testing (1.00 , 0.9987). Furthermore, a 5 fold cross validation test with an average of 99%+

The problem I am having is that when I use the trained classifier with live pictures (zippers that I am passing through the conveyor belt to do validation) it predicts all zippers as bad. 

I took 42 individual pictures of good zippers to validate and it predicts all of them as being bad (only one picture per pass this time). I dont understand how this can be happening if it performs so well on the testing set. It predicts more than 1000 zippers that are good correctly. 

Also when I place the first 20 pictures of the validation set in the training set, it is able to predict about 16 right out of the 22 that are left in the validation set. 

I really do not know what to do. I would appreciate any piece of advise. 

Thanks for the help!

Got average grades while taking 7 courses. Between now &amp; then I'd make &amp; tidy up my portfolio on Github containing web dev projects, Python scripts. 

I've always targeted IT + healthcare, having half-way studied Nursing before changing careers and now I'm facing a conundrum which position I'd apply for to leverage my skills &amp; experience.

The roles state: 

*For the Clinical Analyst roles, in addition to the required education qualifications and experience, education with a Health Information Systems focus and software support experience working directly with clinicians is considered an asset.*

*For the Business Systems Analyst roles, a diploma or degree in Computer Information Systems is preferred. As well, previous experience working directly with business and financial systems (Scheduling, HRIS, ERP, LMS, etc.) and providing detailed business analysis, is considered an asset.*

As much doing a clinical role is a dream job, I find the second position to be a more viable and flexible long-term; I could transition better on similar positions outside of healthcare. 

However, those positions' job description sometimes would focus more either on business or the IT side. 

That said, I feel I should have at least some business &amp; basic accounting principles. Any advice what I should work on further aside from those? Thanks in advance.

Even though data science is one of the paths (as you will see below), this does not mean that I am set on going into data science. I just want to know what is the general outlook if graduates that have / do not have degree with specializations.

I'm a Year 2 uni student studying statistics now, and it's almost time to have to decide if I want to specialize (since my choice of modules taken will have to reflect that). 

Currently, there are 3 routes. 1 without specialization, 1 with a specialization in data science, and the last one in business statistics. 

I am a little uncertain. On the one hand, I feel like specializing in the business statistics route as I may want to go towards that route in the future. On the other hand, I feel like if I take the route, there may be 2 problems.

A) It will greatly limit the choice of modules I can take and my timetable becomes much more rigid for the next 3 years. I'm worried that I may not be able to complete all the modules I need to complete due to future timetable clashes (especially so since I'm planning to double major in economics as well)

B) Will that close me off to a section of the job market in the future? Sure, companies who are looking for someone to analyse their business data may rank me higher than a similar job applicant without this specialization, but it could also backfire and close me off when it comes to many other industries (programming jobs, data analytics). And I would think that the number of industries that close me off would be far greater than the number of industries that are more open to me as a job applicant.

Anyone has any advice? If it matters, I am currently double majoring in Economics. I also plan on getting a Master's (most likely in Statistics, but may also consider Data Science, as I feel there may be a stronger focus on CompSci) in the future. Thanks in advance.",5,0

People who have successfully reached the skill to be employed in this field or currently learning. I would like to know your learn schedule and the courses you took. I have my basics down with python and did 2 projects. I am confused where to start learning now - stats or ml. Even though i had a solid path for python ( MIT 6.00 and automate the boring stuff), i feel kinda lost in this area. There's sooooo many courses- Google, Stanford etc. 

The learning from the 2 projects using python i did was equivalent to 2 new courses for me. So if you could share your story concerning personal project you did along with learning, that would be great!

as an upcoming sophomore in Economics with a focus on Data Science, I want to buy an iMac for the use in that field. (I know iMac overpriced and stuff, I still like it over Windows, which I had for the first 18 years of my life).

The question is whether I need a better graphics card or can I go with a worse one? In addition, the question on RAM. Do I need 64 or am I good with 32GB of DDR4 RAM?

Another question is on the processor. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](jtgp3196j0i11 ""I'm indifferent between the two on the left. The one in the middle is better in terms of RAM (64GB) and is upgradeable to an i7 of 7th generation with 4.2GHz (Turbo 4.5GHz)."")

So the question is, is it worth it to buy the one in the middle with an i7 RAM capacity bump and a slightly better graphics card or should I stick to the one on the left which will cover my needs with a lower price?  

&amp;#x200B;

One final question:

As far as I know, Machine Learning is the most demanding task in Data Science. I don't know why though. What does Machine Learning need? Good Graphics Card right? I am asking, as it is possible that in 4-5 years I'll do some sort of Machine Learning and would rather not buy an expensive machine again.

I'm studying statistics and economics, but would like a career in computer science. Data science seems a nice mix, but I like CS for the fun problem-solving. E.g. writing my first programs in python feels like solving logic puzzles and fit them together into something that works, which is wonderful. Typical data science tools like SQL don't seem to involve this kind of problem-solving, and don't seem interesting to me (I could be wrong about this, since I don't know a lot about it).
Do you think data science, or any CS disciplines related to statistics/econometrics, involve a lot of the fun problem-solving that I like?

Thanks for any info

PS: I'm currently deciding which degree to pursue (statistics/economics/acquiring good coding skills without an official degree). Right now I'd describe my dream job as: some thinking and discussing about which problems need to be solved; a lot of problem-solving (like coding in e.g. python); and some thinking and discussing about the solutions that I found.

First of all, I am not sure if I posted this in the right place. But, I am breaking my head over this problem, so would be more than happy with your help. I am kind of new to the data science field, so please be gentle. For my dissertation, I am researching the effect of international trade on income inequality at the industry level. I gathered data for the income inequality measurements at the industry level, implying 19 industries, for 12 countries, for a time period of 15 years (see attachment 1 for overview). Furthermore, I collected the international trade variable at the industry level as well. However, my other (control) variables cannot be find at the industry level, but at the country level instead (e.g. education). Implying the following regression specification; 

[regression](https://i.redd.it/bgv1jfufj1i11.png)

The subscripts i, j and t respectively represents sector, country and wave (time).Whereas IIijt denotes income inequality, hence the Gini-coefficient, mean log deviation, Theil-index, Atkinson-index ( =0.5), and the p90/p10 ratio. alpha indicates the intercept. Xijt symbolizes the vector of variables reported at the industry level, including the main independent/explanatory variable for international trade; industry exposure to international trade. Next, Zjt is the vector of the other independent variables, which are reported at the country level; e.g. economic growth, education and inflation rate. Next, D reflects a dummy variable, which are the incidents (e.g. China entrance WTO) shocking model. mu signifies the sector-by-country fixed effects and theta the wave (time) fixed effects. And epsilon the error term.

As a beginner in data science, this creates a few problems/questions for me. First, how can I combine data at the industry level and country level in my dataset (see attachment)? Divide the country level variables by 12 or just give it the same value for each industry? Second, how do I construct the panel dataset in STATA? Using *xtset Industry Year?* Or *xtset Country Year?* Third, how do I analyze the effects on income inequality in one regression, thus let STATA run the specified model? And fourth, how do I generate the sector-by-country and wave (time) fixed effects in the model?

Thank you very much in advance from a very stressed economic student!

I am a recent college graduate who developed an interest in data science relatively late in their college career. Though I attended a fairly prestigious private school, all the math/CS classes were huge and very hands off, so I ended up 'following my passion' and majoring in English (I should have double majored). After taking a python class in my senior year I got really interested in data science and have spent the summer building up my coding and math skills using MOOCs and the abundance of helpful suggestions on this subreddit. Though my skill level is not insubstantial, I'm obviously lacking the knowledge base, exposure and credentials of someone with a STEM degree. 

On the basis of this self-study, I applied and was accepted to a fairly rigorous data science boot camp with an appealing project-based curriculum and what seems to be a robust career support framework. Though the program seems to have a solid reputation based on what I've read on the internet (though the issue of bootcamps seems to be a polarizing one), I am concerned that the purported impact will be far less significant for someone with my background as opposed to someone with a more quantitative orientation. The counter-narrative to this is that such a program would have a greater influence on my career trajectory by providing practical experience and networking cache that could paper over my academic deficiencies. 

This program is due to start in a couple of months, and though my enthusiasm for the field is only deepening as I progress, I am very worried that my horizons are limited by my undergrad degree. Graduate work for example seems like it would be totally out of the question, and I am skeptical that employers will be comfortable looking past the lack of a STEM degree. 

Given the magnitude of the commitment and the pretty alarming risks associated with it, would it be a wiser decision to keep the powder dry and forgo the bootcamp?

There are probably \~2000 employees that, among other things, reads the form and manually type the data into our system (things like Name, Date,SSN, Type, etc).   


I feel like this would be a great place for me to have an impact (people wouldn't be let go, just given a new set of responsibilities within the company as they all have a lot of experience in the industry and are very much needed).

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever tackled a problem like this and have any advice? I am not very familiar with projects like this and need some help identifying what to read up on.  


I was thinking the process would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

1) identify the form using image recognition of some sort  


2) Rotate and scale image

&amp;#x200B;

3) identify the locations of the entered text (would I want to use YOLO or perhaps there is a way to just have an almost fixed set and location of boxes based on the form type?)  


4) use some algorithm to extract text (OCR?)

&amp;#x200B;

5) flag possible data issues (e.g. name and SSN dont match)

&amp;#x200B;

6) have employee validate the flagged data.

I would guess we receive 50-100 forms per minute so a fast set of algorithms would be great.",1,5

Hello everyone! I realize resume review might not exactly be allowed on this sub so please excuse me if this is the case.

I would really appreciate some critique on my current resume, as I'm about to be re-entering the job market and looking for my first serious data analyst position. I think it's passable, but I'd love some input from everyone here to help me take it to the next level.

Some notes about my background/resume:
* I feel as my formal education is largely irrelevant; I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in an unrelated field (film/art business studies) and have been self-learning Python, software design, machine learning, calculus/statistics/linear algebra, etc. for the past few years. I'm not entirely sure how I should explain how I'm self taught on my resume, or whether that's even worth mentioning (or leaving to my cover letters).
* That being said, I'm currently enrolled in a night studies certificate to learn more about stats, big data technologies, etc.
* I've hyperlinked text in the PDF to GitHub repositories showing my code for projects/wherever its mentioned. Is this common practice? If anyone would like to give me feedback on my GitHub work I'd gladly dm you so you can take a look!
* I'm applying to data analyst positions that are a match to the technical stuff I want to be doing (Python, SQL), but I'm also interested in any entry level data engineering roles as well. How does my resume fare for those?
* As far as programming languages go, I only know Python and SQL (but I know them well). Is a lack of R, or any other general purpose languages a glaring omission in anyone's eyes?

Any advice for landing a data analyst position would be greatly appreciated! I know there's no way I could land a data scientist position yet (at any decent company anyways) so I'm not even shooting for those. Thank you!",0,2

My workplace, which I've worked for one-year-and-a-bit is slightly behind in technology, but making serious effort to adapt.

I came from a statistical background with BS in Statistics and MS in Analytics so I have a good foundation in statistical training. I am reasonably respected in my team and often act as the sole, or the senior developer in our DS projects. For this reason, I was in a fortunate position to be able to study and understand, albeit shallowly, a sizeable array of concepts, ranging from ML topics, visualisation, and cloud computing (currently studying for AWS CSA). My previous company, a consulting firm specilising in marketing analytics has also allowed me to gain some important skills in stakeholder management and powerpoint.

I very quickly felt lost when I proceeded to assess my options for the next career move due to lack of career progression and salary. I found myself a jack of all trade but master of none. For example, I studied a good chunk of Deep Learning and Recommender Systems, but they were not related to my work and I quickly forgot what I studied as I do not do side projects. My MSc is respectable, but considered by some as 'not hardcore enough' to land serious ML roles. I was curious enough to study for AWS CSA (to gain the ability to develop projects end-to-end), but a huge part of the curriculum is not really related to my work as we have a team of DEs to look after the prod system.

I would like to make a step forward in my career, and continue working as a Data Scientist on the Individual Contributor track, but I feel lost and am unsure of what to do.

I want to start studying a MS in my country (Colombia) and after finishing it I want to study abroad. The thing is... I want to make good decisions. 

My options here are a MS in economics (just one year since it's in my University), a MS in statistics or a MS in computer engineering (oriented to Machine Learning). 

I don't know which would be the best option for me.. In addition I'd like to study another MS in stats or something like machine learning abroad maybe in four to five years.

One place I am having a tough time really understanding and finding a clear answer is with multicollinearity and the dummy variable trap.

I understand the basic case of male/female as outlined [here](http://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html): 

y ~ b + {0|1} male + {0|1} female

where the X matrix looks like [b, m1, f1]...[b, mn, fn]. I understand that dropping either a class column or the intercept column will then allow my matric to be invertible. In the link above they use another example for a category of three classes with the same operation.

**Here is my question**: if I combine these two examples and start with two columns, one with two classes (male/female) and the second with three classes (blue, red, green), when I make dummy variables do I need to drop one of the dummy classes for each initial column (one for sex, one for color) or do I just need to drop one of the dummy classes? My thinking on this is that my variable matrix would then look like:

X = [b, m1, f1, b1, r1, g1] ... [b, mn, fn, bn, rn, gn]

718,2018-8-27,2018,8,27,14,9am8jp,How Data Science Help Stock Brokers to take decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9am8jp/how_data_science_help_stock_brokers_to_take/,trainmehub786,1535346510,"o begin with, let me explain you a term known as Standard Deviation:

In statistics, the [standard deviation](http://www.trainmehub.com/courses/data-science/) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

In finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.

For example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock Bs additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to 10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to 50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).

Calculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean. Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset. The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries. Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.

Population standard deviation is used to set the width of Bollinger Bands, a widely adopted technical analysis tool. For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as x + nx. The most commonly used value for n is 2; there is about a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.

Financial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the [statistical calculations](http://www.trainmehub.com/category/data-science/) above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.",1,0

While I am definitely excited about the opportunity to do the TDI bootcamp, I am hesitant to enroll given my lack of  training in this area and am not convinced I am at the level that I need to be in order to understand the more advanced material and successfully complete the weekly assignments.

After I realized knowing Python was essential to being a TDI scholar/fellow (1 week into the program), I deferred my enrollment and have been learning Python/pandas/data wrangling daily for about 2 months. Now I have to make a final decision to re-enroll or take the partial tuition refund.

Does anyone have experience with TDI , specifically insight about my ability to be successful in this bootcamp given my non-technical, social science background?  Is this program a good fit for me or should I keep learning on my own at my own pace?

Also, I'm wondering what the ballpark job placement rate is for TDI scholars/fellows (especially those w/o preexisting, extensive programming/CompSci skills)? The networking/job placement services were another bonus that attracted me to TDI.",2,2

I am freelance Android Developer and been working as a professional software developer since last 2 years.

I have been reading articles on Data Science and have decided to make transition towards career in Data Science.

I have been looking for Data Science bootcamps in Europe. It turns out there are full-time immersive bootcamps that train you with all the relevant skills and make you job-ready in 2-3 months. These bootcamps also include a portfolio-project, demo day and a hiring day. Their tuition fees can be as high as 13,000 euros.

The most important question I have is, do people, who become Data Scientist via bootcamps, get hired as full-time employees? Are bootcamps worth the price or is there a better way?

It would be great, if anyone can provide real life examples. Thanks!",5,3

I thought I would introduce a new shiny application I have been working on that acts as a knowledge repository, displaying your `Markdown` and `RMarkdown` files listed under the directory. It can even run `python` chunks embedded in `Rmarkdown` files.

##### Links
- Demo: [ShinyR Shinyapps.io](https://jessevent.shinyapps.io/knowledge-repo/)
- GitHub: [ShinyR GitHub](https://github.com/JesseVent/shinyr-knowledge-repo)

Let me know what you think

### The **shinyR** curated knowledge sharing platform

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JesseVent/shinyr-knowledge-repo/master/www/1.png)

### Introduction

Built in R with use of the [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) package, this application will list any `RMarkdown.Rmd` or `Markdown.md` that sit under the specified/default directory no matter how many folders there are underneath. By listing all these files you get a true sense of the knowledge collective available to you, and by clicking any of the files listed it will dynamically load the content in a new tab for your viewing pleasure.

Through the reticulate package it can even run embedded python chunks inside `RMarkdown.Rmd` files.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JesseVent/shinyr-knowledge-repo/master/www/4.png)

### The Key Principles

-   **Reproducibility** There should be no opportunity for code forks. The entire set of queries, transforms, visualizations, and write-up should be contained in each contribution and be up to date with the results.
-   **Quality** No piece of research should be shared without being reviewed for correctness and precision.
-   **Consumability** The results should be understandable to readers besides the author. Aesthetics should be consistent and on brand across research.
-   **Discoverability** Anyone should be able to find, navigate, and stay up to date on the existing set of work on a topic.
-   **Learning** In line with reproducibility, other researchers should be able to expand their abilities with tools and techniques from others work.

### Inspiration

This application is loosely inspired from a mix of the principles of [Airbnb's Knowledge Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo) and the user interface from [GetGrav's Learn2](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-learn2) with my own spin on my thought's about what a knowledge repo should be, combined with some functionality that **Shiny** brings together so well.

&gt; The Knowledge Repo project is focused on facilitating the sharing of knowledge between data scientists and other technical roles using data formats and tools that make sense in these professions. It provides various data stores (and utilities to manage them) for ""knowledge posts"", with a particular focus on notebooks (R Markdown and Jupyter / IPython Notebook) to better promote reproducible research. [Airbnbs Description](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo)

### Next Steps

This application is still in it's infancy, but the next major change I want to make is to allow the application to be given a Gitlab project, and allow you to view all the markdown files that sit in sub-projects beneath it.

Happy for any other feedback or thoughts.

I am looking to stay in state, and besides UW's MS in Information Management (a similar but different degree - still a possibility nevertheless) and Seattle U's Business Analytics program (a possibility), there aren't very many options for analytics programs with my current background. I'm looking for coursework that is statistics heavy and makes use of programming and current software (R, Python, Tableau, SQL, etc.), and which includes some type of capstone project/portfolio/internship for ease of employment upon graduating.

Northeastern University's Seattle campus offers a hybrid analytics program - part online/on-""campus"" that has a very strong curriculum, is affordable, and doesn't require an extremely math- or programming-heavy background. This seems perfect. 

When talking to the admissions team, I was told that the degree wouldn't specify whether it was the Seattle campus or whether online/on-campus; it would simply say ""Northeastern University MS in Analytics.""

Is anyone familiar with this program? Anything to be wary of when it comes to these sister campuses? Are hybrid/online programs any less valuable than a traditional education?

Last year I started a DS course at my school beside my regular software engineering course where I learn mainly Java and C#. I still need to learn a lot. I practiced with ML and I did use python libraries like sklearn, pandas, numpy etc. Right now I am a trainee at a company that focuses on collecting data from trucks and trailers by using API's or a units they created and installed inside the trucks/trailers. They sell the data to customers by creating custom dashboards.

My assignment is to apply DS with an idea of my own. The goal is to create an informative graph or target that can be included in the dashboard.

I practiced with ML classification models like svm or rf but not that much with models used for regression.  I am planning to predict the fuel usage of a planned trip. Features I can get my hands on are for example distance, altitude, weather conditions, fuel consumption, weight of the truck etc. I am doing some research on models that could be appropriate to fulfill the job.   


I have three questions:

\- Can fuel usage prediction be done and is predicting the fuel usage a realistic assignment for a beginner ?

\- What models are suitable for the job and what is your experience with them? After some research I find out that examples of suitable models are regression tree, random forest, boosted tree or support vector regression

\- I am looking for an idea to do something with the coordinates of vehicles, any interesting ideas?

I had posted this question in Cross Validated but did not get any help. I hope to get some help here!

In the course of learning machine learning, I understand that bootstrapping is considered a powerful approach for adjusting for overfitting in measures of predictive ability of a model. Based on information I have gathered, I have tried the following approach for my work (logistic regression to predict binary outcome with 50 predictor variables),

1. Fit the model to full original data

2. Feature selection with backward stepwise algorithm with 100 bootstraps.

(and select the variables that are chosen most frequently)

3. Repeat the following 1000 times;

a. Generate bootstrapped data 

b. Split the bootstrapped data into training (70% data) and test (30% data) sets

c. Fit the selected model (from step 2) to training data

d. Test the fitted model with test data

e. Calculate Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC)

4. Report average AUROC with 95% Confidence Interval.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I would appreciate if someone could comment on whether there is any problem in the approach. 

Second, do I understand right that I am basically evaluating the selected variables for their predictive ability, but not the model itself. Because during each iteration, the model is fit with different data and thus the model will be different each time with different estimated coefficients. So, can we really say that we are evaluating the model?

I will be very thankful for anyone who could help me out with this confusion!

Hi /r/datascience, 

I'm looking for some advice regarding transitioning into a second career in data science from a psych/health care background.

A little background: I'm currently a Speech Pathologist working at a large, urban hospital. I have a Masters in Speech Pathology and a Bachelors in Psychology. Statistics coursework includes: several bachelors and graduate courses in research methods, Introduction to Statistics, Multivariate Analysis, and Calculus (high school coursework). My current job has both a clinical and research focus, and I have published four papers in respectable journals in our field. Ive been the lead on these projects in terms of design, data collection, and writing, but have worked with a statistician for all analyses. In terms of coding, Ive just begun learning R basics on the side. 

Originally, I intended to pursue a PhD in my field after working clinically for a few years but Ive begun to have an interest in data science. I'm not sure what specific field or type of work I'd be interested in yet, but I enjoy working with data, answering research questions, and presenting results. 

With my background, what coursework would I need to complete before applying for a MS program for statistics/data science? Ive been looking into Boston Universitys 1 year masters in Statistical Practice, which looks like its geared towards data science jobs. Would this type of program be a good option for someone looking to get into data science? Or would self-study or another path be more advisable?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of jumping into the data science world and getting a masters of Data Science at IU or Online Masterof Science in Analytics at Georgia Tech. I currently hold a bachelors (engineering) and work in my industry (medical device). I don't do a whole lot of stats/coding on a regular basis at my job (maybe some light excel/minitab stuff from time to time). But my brief periods of using excel/minitab to manipulate and work with data have stirred up my education boner. I wasn't really into coding while in college because I saw it as more of a line of work where I would just make apps (dumb, but I just saw it as field where I would be making some random application like an ms office clone)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've gotten the itch to get back to school and i've realized that i DO like coding when it comes to working with data sets and doing magic with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my question is, is it worth getting the degree and jumping into the field?

What kind of job opportunities/career progression is available for people with these kind of degrees? ",0,1

I'm trying to predict which P2P borrowers will default/charge off a loan. 

In the first iteration, I used only my own investment data to create a binary classification of those who paid back their loans (0) and those who defaulted (1). The problem lies in the ratio of available data: 99% of people paid, and 1% defaulted. So the NN has learned to predict that 100% of people will pay their loans and can still report 99% accuracy.

I found a much bigger data set (about 850k items vs. my original 4k) with the hope that throwing more data at the model might help. Unfortunately, the overall ratio is the same: 99% paid and 1% defaulted. This results in the same inaccurate prediction.

So experts, can you share any advice on how to approach this kind of problem? I was wondering if it's a logical approach to alter the ratio of the training set, i.e. use less of the data overall so that 1% becomes 25%. Alternatively, I am only using 2 features in the initial NN. Could adding more complexity with additional features improve the accuracy?",73,131

 I obviously want to stay employed for as long as possible for why I'm asking this question. Also, I want to make sure the technology I'm learning isn't obsolete. The few similarities I see is that you can use Python and SQL for all three of these careers.

Is it possible to adapt from one career to the next?

I'm just curious because, I'm wondering if a web development job is not available (could be over saturated, etc). What is the next best career alternative I can try out that's similar where I don't have to relearn a new set of tech skills?

I realize the consensus on this sub seems to be to do CS/Stats as an undergrad major, but we have a large demand for a Data Science major within the business school and that is the task I have been given.   


I have collected a lot of information from other BS, BA, BBA programs, but I want to get some input from practitioners. Where else do you find experts who are passionate about a subject but Reddit?  


(If this is against the rules please let me know and I will try to gather information other places.)   


Any feedback you can give me will be helpful, however we have a great deal of flexibility in terms of designing new courses or using courses from across our campus so what I would like to hear from those of you out there in the trenches is what topics and or skills you think a freshly minted business major looking for a job in Data Science should have.  


*A little background that may focus the conversation:*  
 To avoid ""overfitting"" or producing a ""flash in the pan"" major we are creating the program as a track within our existing BS in Economics (not a BBA). So you can assume they will have covered: Calculus 1, basic probability, mathematical calculus based Micro and Macro Theory, introductory applied Econometrics (OLS, Logit, Probit with R). Also we project that \~50% of the students will also be double majors with CS, Math, Stats or Finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me provide a template that you should feel free to completely ignore :)  


**Your background:**   
Examples: Currently learning, Working as Data Scientist, Hirer of Data Scientist, Trainer, Professor etc... If it is in your flair then skip this one.   


**Conceptual Topics that MUST be covered:**   
Topics and techniques that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples:  Regression, Machine Learning?  


**Conceptual Topics that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**  
Topics and techniques that would be nice to see, but are not deal breakers. Possible Examples: Linear Algebra, Hierarchical Models, Bayesian MLE, Frequentists MLS, Non-Parametic Estimation, Distributed Systems, MCMC?  


**Practical Skills that MUST be covered**:  
Skills and tools that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples: R or Python/Pandas, Data Mining/Cleaning, SQL?    


**Practical Skills that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**  
Skills and tools that would be nice to see but are not deal breakers. Possible examples: Hadoop, Spark, Matlab/NumPy? 

  
**What would the ideal internship look like?**  
We will be requiring internships and we want them to provide real signaling to potential employers.

I'm trying to build a relatively simple recommendation system of sorts for shopping/grocery transactional data, with two use cases:

1. Given a customer has x items in their shopping basket, I want to recommend y items based on their current basket
2. Given one item, I want to see related or recommended items

 A Market Basket Analysis approach seems sensible, to which I've used R and the accompanying packages arules and arulesViz for the visualisation. My problem is, how do I approach building the actual recommendation system? I can use the Apriori algorithm to generate some 'rules', e.g. {butter, milk} =&gt; {bread}, based on the parameters support, confidence and lift, but how would I actually *build* a model/algorithm that could recommend items based on a shopping basket I have? What extra steps do I need to take? Or does anyone know of any articles/tutorials that would be easy to follow?

Data analytics can be applied to help the owner or the managers to understand their company performance through data analysis. In addition, the business could be re-position in the industry and seize business opportunities as a result of business performance improvement. 

To achieve the goal, we need to understands the needs of the business and helps companies identify hidden problems and design solutions from their current state by collecting data, creating databases, building complex data models, analyzing data, predicting performance trends, and visualizing analysis results. 

Big data analytics requires lifelong learning as well as other areas. A successful data analyst needs to have strong logical thinking skills and solid data programming skills. Analysts need to turn real-world problems into analyzable data, be good at manipulating databases, and be proficient in programming, statistics, machine learning, data mining, and predictive models.

After a probationary period I lost my DS job at a startup. They realized they needed more software engineering (not my specialty) and less data analysis (more my specialty). They also weren't all about sales/marketing enablement yet, also a strength. A lot needed to be built. This was a new team and we were pretty much split between software and analysis but then it reached a point where I couldn't keep up with the new direction so that was the end of it. That and a ton of office politics that was poorly timed and took everyone by surprise. That said I loved my work on the analysis side, which included ML, and want to continue. Whether it's DS or a glorified data analyst title, that's what I'm going for.

However, all of my DS work was at this company and I have no portfolio. I lost it all in the sudden separation (not that I could share company work anyway so it's moot). Now I'm not sure how to get hired again without a portfolio. It was nearly impossible the first time. So I've decided to spend a month working on building one up based on all I've learned. Then I'll apply and keep building. As a recent job searcher, I really need a break to focus. However, what do I do about LinkedIn? On a paper resume I can highlight projects but my LinkedIn will just appear as if I have nothing going on. I hesitate to say self-employed because I'm not making myself money through the projects. Is there anything I can reasonably replace my position with to show I'm working productively with my time?

TLDR: Between work, taking a break to work on portfolio, how to show productive work on LinkedIn.

I'm hoping this will not only build our programming skills, but also our analytical thinking, storytelling, and our ability to speak about our code and projects during an interview.  

If you're a python pro or data science expert and would like to join as a mentor, that would be great!  

FYI, I have been learning python and data science concepts for about a year now, on and off, and I consider myself closer to an intermediate level when it comes to python.",8,5
