I want to build and evaluate a content-based recommender system. I am using the standard MovieLens dataset: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

I would like to know how can i build a content-based predictor for movie ratings (1-5 stars). I can extract movie profiles from features like genres/actors/tags etc. I didn't find much around for content-based prediction algorithms, the majority of results are for collaborative filtering and latent factor model approaches. Thus any advice on how i can proceed will be very appreciated!

I have the opportunity to write my Master Thesis in Computer Science about Reddit. The problem is: I still don't know exactly about what. :)


Situation: There is a dataset of Reddit posts on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/reddit/reddit-comments-may-2015)
, which is just an excerpt from this [complete reddit dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/). I want to use some Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning on this data. I already have found the support of a supervisor at my University who is letting me do this.


Problem: Finding a scientific question to solve. Do you have any ideas for me?


tl;dr: If you had a dataset of all posts on reddit and the time to analyse some effects/communities/behaviour on reddit with NLP and Machine Learning, what would you like to know/find out?",2,1

I'm interested in ideas those of you here might have around how to take multiple data sets around the same events that have errors in them (human coding error, precision errors, etc.) and finding ways to combine them into a single ""better"" data set. I'm sure I've seen this approach somewhere, but can't find the research or methods I thought I had read up on. Off the top of my head there are some basic ideas I've thought of myself:

**Single streams from each source**

Best used when you know that data set A is accurate in one variable, but you know data set B isn't, but data set B has additional variables or can address inaccuracies in data set A, etc.

**Voting to choose**

When there are three or more sets of independent data containing the same or comparable variables, and the errors are not consistent (i.e. human errors), it would be possible to choose which one to take by selecting a value based on what the majority agrees on.

**Combining to find a better precision**

I imagine this is best suited to problems where a variable is suspected to be out in all data streams (perhaps with positional data), and so averaging - perhaps with providing a range/confidence to indicate upper/lower boundaries that would be acceptable - might be the way forward.

**With time series data, spot the outlier**

If I have time series data where I'm expecting very smooth connections between each time step, it's possible that outliers can be automatically identified, perhaps with the aid of above methods.

**Any others?** 

I'm sure all of you have experience of doing this in a more coherent way. I have access to several data sets that involve time series positional data, but we know there are inaccuracies in there (some of the differences between time steps are highly unlikely), and we're trying to find ways to better ""clean it"" automatically.",0,1

My plan is to develop a basic machine learning algorithm using the Scikit-learn laboratory package for Python then create some sort of test network that will hold fictional data and have basic encryption then to play as the adversary and try to breach the system by providing false data to the machine system to see if it can distinguish between friend and foe. Is this a worthwhile topic to pursue and does anyone know how they would do it? Would appreciate good quality replies ,4,0

Currently, I am the sole Data Analyst for my company (Staffing Firm). More or less I am responsible for extracting data from our DB and producing specific reports for various departments within the company (Sales, Revenue, Executive), primarily with SQL. We acquired a BI tool that I am essentially responsible for and have spent time doing some of the BI reporting, but due to the culture of the company this has somewhat plateaued until we can embed the software within our platform.  

I am looking for some advice on what more I can be doing to expand my role. My day to day has stagnated significantly; reporting has become redundant and for the most part automated (I have queries saved and just tweak where I need to) and I feel I am not doing any real analysis anymore, although I am not sure how much I was doing to begin with.   

Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!",6,9

I'm a Masters student presently looking for jobs in the data science and BI-fields. I have previously worked in image and Video classification using machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow,caffe, etc. I also  have experiences in C++, python &amp; Matlab. I have been actively applying for entry level positions for 2 months and have not received a single call back.



I know that I don't have experience in these fields. But I would like to know how do I get an entry level job ? Because the constant application and rejection are getting me down. Do I need to do a MOOC and then add it to my resume would that really help me out ?

Any suggesions welcome ?",14,13

I'm doing a two year degree in public health, and have increasingly become interested in the data side of things. So I am wondering if my experience would be enough to find data analyst type jobs. I've taken classes in Stata and SAS, SQL, and ArcGIS, but most classes in R, and that's what I use for my RA and thesis work. I've taken a year of biostats, and have taken/will take classes in health informatics, programming, machine learning, and some more applied biostats classes, like multilevel modeling and spatial analysis. I have a github account with some class projects I did, and probably my thesis work. 

I won't have the more advanced theoretical stats courses, that people in the biostats department take. Would you all say it's enough for health data analyst positions? What about moving beyond that?",20,11

688,2016-11-11,2016,11,11,11,5cc6d0,What should I study for master? CS + Information Systems or Data Science?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5cc6d0/what_should_i_study_for_master_cs_information/,octmb,1478832730,"I'm a Software engineer student close to graduating and I have since 6 years ago wanted to study a master in CS. However I took a machine learning course on Coursera and as I work since +2 years ago for a Business Intelligence company I was given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in one of the projects. The thing is that I am really enjoying using Machine learning algorithms to solve problems but I also enjoy the algorithmic and problem-solving part from CS.

As I am now preparing my documents for the application process for the master in highly recognized universities in Switzerland and Germany I have noticed that these universities have Computer Science masters and the possibility to focus on machine learning and intelligent systems which sounds really appealing to me. However they are recently offering a Data Science master which covers the same machine learning contents + statistics. This led me to ask myself what kind of job I could have if I took this track (Information systems)? Would those be substantially different from the jobs I could apply for if I studied Data science?
From my perspective one would provide me with specific knowledge and tools and the other one will provide me with general knowledge with the possibility of focusing on a topic.

My questions here are:

* What is the benefit or difference of studying one or the other? Examples?
* How would this affect my job opportunities? Examples?
* As I am feeling more inclined to CS + Information Systems my concern here would be: Could I apply to a Data scientist job if I wanted?
* Related to the previous question: I feel that CS + Information Systems would give me a wider range of job possibilities or different combinations, do you think this is true? Do you have any example?



TL;DR; I want to study a computer science master since a long time ago. I like machine learning and I would like to have well-paid job where I could use ML in interesting ways. Will a data science master fulfill this?",4,2

I think the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI are all very interesting and also good areas to move into. In hindsight I almost wish I got my PhD in AI or deep learning, but alas I knew nothing about these fields until the last year.

This is not a post about what I need to do to make the transition in terms of aquiring skills. I have been steadily improving my coding, teaching myself ML algorithms, refreshing my statistics knowledge, doing pet projects, etc. I think I'm either ready to be hired or reasonably close. My main question is: where should I go to search for jobs? I regularly look at Kaggle and LinkedIn, and have applied to a fair number of jobs from those sites, but I haven't even had an interview yet. Are there other places I should be searching, or is this basically it and I should interpret the lack of replies as indicating that my resume is awful and needs re-tooling?

Also, I am a US citizen and lived there my whole life until my postdoc began, which is in a European country. I'm searching for jobs in the US, and I'm wondering if the fact that I'm employed outside the US is negatively affecting my chances. Would I be better off if I quit my postdoc and moved to the city I want to find work in? I wonder if it might make employers more likely to give me an interview, but then of course I will be unemployed, which is bad both for the obvious financial reason and also because I won't have any sort of official affiliation. 

Thanks for any advice, it's well appreciated!",7,5

I really got into Clojure lately. Coming from a Python background. 

Super neat language.

I found this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/42svuf/clojure_for_data_science/) from 9 months ago asking about the use of Clojure in DS. Not many people there...

I'm wondering, are there more people here using Clojure now?

Is Scala really killing the popularity of Clojure, or does it still have a chance? It seems like they should be more competitive...",1,2

I work part time at a small boutique marketing firm and I mentioned to my boss that my Uni has a new masters in Data Science, but it requires some form of portfolio to show professional interest in the field. We arranged for me to receive a bulk of information, about our clients and and prospective customers. This pretty much includes, location, industry, contact information and account activity (Our form of contact, their responses etc etc). 

I am hoping to use this is an opportunity to jump into this field and learn some techniques/skills along the way, I don't really expect to produce any valuable information from this as I don't really know what to look for.

Essentially I'm hoping someone here could give me some recommendations of how to go about this process, this could be in any form (e.g telling me I'm an idiot and should go back and read a book on this, or perhaps ""this technique"" would be good, or I should try and demonstrate ""This"" with the data at hand.)

reading this link where it talks about the derivative of softmax.

it says partial derivative of yi in terms of zj

when it says when i = j  does that mean for example the change in the 5th softmax output yi in terms of the 5th input value zi ?

for neural networks, would zi refer to a combinations of weights and inputs from the hidden layer, eg. o1 = h1w6 + h2w8 ?

Appreciate your response.",6,1

I have been working for an electronics company for 3 years now and have recently considered a career switch to Software. I came across this program called ""insight data science/engineering"" where they train people with academic background for Data Science jobs and help them with software job placement. I have been contacted by two of their program managers and scheduled interviews with them. I was wondering if any other people have experience with such programs and have any advice regarding what I should expect. What salary level should I expect(I am currently making low-six figures)? What are the more sought after companies I can get a job from through this path? Overall, do you think it is worth giving up 3 months of pay to prepare myself for a change in my career trajectory?",14,26

I applied at the start of October for the January cohort and interviewed about 5 weeks ago.  I thought it went pretty well and the interviewer said they would get back to me in a week or two, but I haven't heard anything since.

On a friend's advice, I politely emailed one of their admissions people a couple of weeks ago to ask for an update- no response.

This wouldn't be a big deal, except that I need to move clear across the country if I'm going to do it- end my lease, find housing, transport stuff, etc.  

I'm wondering if anyone else has heard back from them?  Or if any of the previous fellows can comment on how long after interviews it took to get a decision?",12,2

I fell into this role after completing a degree in statistics. I am not gifted at mathematics. I'll never do a PHD. Few people will ever get good enough undergraduate results to do a PHD.

Yet, I see a lot of people trying to have a career in Data Science. Are they all just gifted at mathematics ? Or do a lot of jobs not require that ?

I am from Melbourne, so it might be different in the US. From what I see of job advertisements, recruiters are not interested in people who are not from a strong math and stats background. They either specify that they must have PHD/MSC or they must have 10+ years experience.

The course is taught in Python for the first two units and then for the last unit we pick either Java or Javascript. 

My research on this subreddit leads me to believe the answer is Java, but I couldn't really find any reasons why not to pick Javascript mentioned on this sub (yet I'm sure there are plenty). Is it just a no-brainer which is why I only see Java mentioned as a potential pick?

I know neither of those two languages are really recommended for DA/DS, but I don't have a choice and it's free education so I'm not passing that up. I am marginally comfortable with Python and R and am continuing to learn with them. Will be tackling SQL in the future as well.

I really don't have an interest in being a front-end web developer for even short-term, but I do think it'd be nice to be able to make web apps, interactive websites, etc. for nice polished data visualizations at some point. But I really am just interested in building up my skills for working with data  data viz is not something I want to prioritize over analysis skills. 

Also, I will likely pursue an MS in CS in the near future if that helps. So if you think one language over the other would be better for an application and just for preparing me for rigorous CS courses, let me know!

Oh and if it helps, at some point I would love to learn some data engineering skills just so I can be well versed and potentially able to create and maintain my own data infrastructure.

So keeping all that in mind, I'm curious what you much more experienced DA/DS programmers think I should do. 

TL;DR I have to pick a skills-track for a webdev bootcamp in Java or Javascript. Which is a potentially better language to learn for an aspiring DA/DS?

Thanks in advance!",29,7

Several months ago I came here for advice and this thread has been helpful in finding a place for myself in IT once again.  Im currently enrolled with Penn State in a general IT program for my BS.  Currently Ive taken a really large interest in Database Administration but find myself in a problem.  Currently I work help desk in a rather large firm.  I view my position as a good place to start garnering experience while working towards my degree at the same time.  But Im unsure what to do as far as getting more information and development in DBA.  Currently Ive taken the ONE course that is offered for Data Structure that isnt part of a Masters program with the University, and as such I have gone to Lynda as far as continuing my development here.  But I want to know if there are better resources that I should be looking at.  I really want to grow into this and I find data itself interesting as far as the management as well as the language structure utilized for SQL.  As such I find myself extremely wanting and feel like I know nothing in terms of real world application and really want to grow and learn.  Any advice would be awesome .",3,1

I have read that careers in machine learning (as a competitive student from a competitive program) can start at 250k. (source: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-graduates-with-PhD-Machine-Learning-from-top-schools-receive-one-million-dollars-or-more-in-salary-How-do-you-define-the-top-schools) 

Is there any evidence to support the stability of data science as a career? Rather, what is the possibility of me increasing that 250k starting salary to around 500k and maintaining it? I am assuming that higher salary positions are more managerial than entry level positions.

Part of the reason why I ask is because I am considering MD vs PhD/Machine Learning. I am interested in both but if a Machine Learning job from a top program would the provide the same security and potential of maintaining a 500k+ salary then my choice would be a lot easier.

Edit:  Is a 250k salary even possible with data science? I guess I am wondering what salaries will be in 20+ years, and increasing the salary up to 500k+ is remotely feasible.",8,0

So I'm currently doing a yearlong internship at eBay Canada as a Strategy and Analytics intern (mix of SQL, Hive, R, Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics) but I have been looking for a summer 2017 internship in Data Science since I want to break into that industry eventually. I realize that a lot of the comments on this sub point towards Data Science being a field for a Masters/PhD holder but I think that is more in line for research-oriented jobs or those where the projects are very time/resource heavy (e.g. the DataSci team at my company is focusing on redefining our search algorithms, which is like a 2 year project).

I am more interested in jobs that are ""advanced analytics"" i.e. jobs with applied ML/Data Mining techniques, for example the following few jobs:

* [Zillow - Pricing Data Science Intern](http://www.zillow.com/jobs/openings?j=olqc4fwL)

* [Thumbtack - Analytics Intern](https://boards.greenhouse.io/thumbtack/jobs/511726)

* [Point72 - Summer Internship](https://www.point72.com/jobs/campus-investment-services/aperio-summer-internship-2017/?utm_source=glassdoor&amp;utm_medium=Job_Posting&amp;utm_content=links&amp;utm_campaign=social)

* [Knewton - Data Science Internship](https://jobs.lever.co/knewton/79090e31-dc2c-4445-b443-88aed9c68f3e)

I have already applied to about 20 of these sort of jobs, only receiving one interview so far, so I was wondering if any of you would happen to have any advice/critique/tips for improving my resume: http://imgur.com/a/xAsxB (omitted the header with personal information such as name/email address/linkedin/github)

My background is in Industrial/Systems Engineering, so I have taken a fair amount of courses in Statistics, Operations Research, Programming etc. I am also currently taking some online courses in Machine Learning (e.g. [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and the [MIT Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2) and I hope to follow up with some Kaggle competitions to get some more experience

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!!

I'm thinking of splitting the data into yearly chunks, but honestly I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to begin.

I believe I'm going to have to make some scripts to probably separate all the excel sheets from each other and am curious as to how much of a general data scientist split time between cleaning data vs analyzing.

Also, what is the general process that you follow when faced with new data sets? What questions do you like to ask yourself to help you understand? I'm very curious about others' experiences as I am a bit of newbie in data science/analysis in general. ",6,1

From what I know, their HQ is in the US, but the also have a team in India, where I assume most of the heavy duty analytics work is done. The company is very young at about 7 years old, but the founders seems to be very familiar in the field (they had previously sold a company called MarketRX to Cognizant). The only other offer I am considering right now is an IT rotational program at a top 5 pharma company. I would possibly have a chance to work in a sales and marketing analytics rotation during this program. ",4,4

I only did the suggested courses for the Data Science track in the MS Stats program. Feel free to do the others and leave links in the comments if you like.

This isn't exhaustive (some courses were harder to find than others), so this'll likely be a living document. Feel free to send me anything I've missed or better texts for any subject that I should add to the document. 

Also, for free technical textbooks, I've found freecomputerbooks.com to be very helpful (despite the fact that it sounds like clickbait). I'd recommend you check that out before shelling out for any of the textbooks listed.",22,81

If I were to learn python and sql (can I please sub SAS for R?), could I find an entry level job with a stats minor instead of a major? (Im doing a social science degree but have the ability to major in stats if I stay an extra semester or two)",1,5

I have a key question of how likely are you to promote the company.

I then have 10 or so component questions that ask about the service, value, etc.

All of these questions use a 0 to 10 scale.

I want to model the importance of each of the component questions on the key question. 

If someone gives a 0 for a couple of component question, they're likely to give the key question a 0. On the other end of the scale, people typically give scores of 9 or 10 to each component question when giving the key question a 10. The key question scores of 5-8 are typically when the customer scores a couple of component questions well, but not everything.

I'd really like to get a model where I can see which component questions are the most important but i'm finding it very difficult choosing a model that's appropriate to this data set.

Any help would be great.",6,0

It's very common for example to look at a chart of daily or hourly averages, and extrapolate a trend from this (usually in a fuzzy way, e.g. ""these numbers are trending slightly up this month""). So in some way these data analysts are modelling a derived statistic rather than the underlying data itself.

Whereas in science you would never do this, you would have to take (a sample of?) the underlying data, and hypothesis-test/cross-validate.

Has anyone else noticed this? I guess my question is how ""dangerous/misguided"" is the ""business"" point of view? I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt... obviously there will be pathological cases where it fail but is it OK most of the time?

Plus, it is getting tougher and tougher to get a job as data scientist, positions getting less and less, competition higher and higher. 

So my question is, in order to stay on top of the game, is it good to join a tech startup or a big corp like bank. My worry is, if a startup fails, it is so hard to get a job again, since no one else recognize a startup and your skills. If choose to work in a big bank, at least data work is always there and it is good to have a big name on resume.
