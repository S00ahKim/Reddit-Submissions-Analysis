Grad student in epidemiology/biostatistics looking to start transitioning to more DS type work and analysis. I have completed several projects on DataCamp and try to work through what I can on Codewars (to sharpen my Python skills). I often find, however, that there is a significant leap to *really* doing projects that include data scrubbing, importing, cleaning, analysis and write-up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Willing to do this work, and feel like it is consistently the number one answer to ""how do I get the attention of employers"" but I just find constant barriers to entry and/or ambiguity regarding 1) a good workflow, 2) data sources, and 3) projects that will be valuable and worth putting on a resume. *Bonus points: How* do I actually list such an experience on a resume...?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally looking for projects related to healthcare, biotech, etc.

The data I am gonna be using is :

1. their grade range (high, medium, low)
2. their behavioral patterns (1-100 number of times) like raising hands, checking forums, etc., 
3. their parents involvement (Father/Mom answered the survey, whether they are satisfied with the school)

I want to know what kind of data mining techniques I can use to analyze the above data?

Right now, I can think of association ruling, and I looked up online and find a method called feature analysis. But I am not sure if I can do it on SAS enterprise miner.

What more methods can I use to analyze the data using SAS EM?

I am talking with the company. I want to ask about behavior that seems sketchy to me. 

How often do you promise the client that you can answer their question before even seeing the data?

In Science, normally you make a hypothesis and you could either fail or succeed. It seems odd to me the confidence in which they believe the problem can be solved without any domain experience and without having seen the data. It seems plausible to me that the data we have might not contain what is necessary to come to any conclusion. 

No data has been sent yet, and they have created a plan of attack that involves receiving the data, and then pumping it through 3 different levels of machine learning models. So the output of one model is the input of the next one. 


Can you with one model that takes multiple inputs, output multiple outputs that are both categorical and numeric? 

So for example, if you trained this model, and predict x =(0,a,b,2,1,c) it might output y = (3,s,y,6,5,p). Is this something that is relatively common? 

From the little bit of knowledge I have, it seems like this is not normal. Can anyone help assuage my concerns? ",13,1

So if youre me, should I go through the course without the programming section. 

Also the course is based on non vectorised programming but I think most of us prefer the latter due to its simplicity. Just need to check dimensions and Ensure you put a Dot when you do scalar operations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like you all to review my resume and let me know what you think. I know the design and format are important but I am hoping for a focus on my actual skills and experience. I have a lot of projects but I did not include them in this resume. Instead, I send out another attachment with it that has all the projects that I've done as well as the ones I am doing or planning to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

These projects include things like Manpower Scheduling optimization, Market Basket Analysis, Automation, Forecasting, and a lot more. The great thing about working at my current employer is that we have a tiny analytics team so my job is very hands on which provides me with a lot of experience (and projects) in a short time.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'd like to talk more about my technical chops in the resume to show that I know how to do things like: Bagging and Boosting, KNN, K means, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Network Analysis, Markov Chains, PCA, and a lot more. I'm not sure how to show that in a one page resume or should I mention it in the cover letter?

I've been in my role as a Junior Data Analyst for almost two years but now feel that I am overqualified and I think I should be able to find a more senior role with better pay as well. Most jobs that I am currently applying to are ""Business Analyst"" jobs or similar.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a lot of volunteering activities in the data science and entrepreneurship spaces. Including being the IT Chair in a professional institution's local chapter.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what advice you all have and what you think of my skills.

Im looking to plan out what conferences to hit up in 2019. Ive searched the sub and found some lackluster posts that really dont give a good breakdown of possible conferences. 

Im more of a python person myself, so I am interested in targeting python centered conferences (but still open to any general conferences).

Im in California, so the ones on my list already are ODSC West and a PyData (I think in LA?). 

Trying to figure out one or two out of state conferences to target. SciPy looks pretty cool. PyCon looks interesting but not really targeted to analytics or anything (although Im sure there would be some content there). 

NIPS looks interesting but also a bit... theory heavy/academic? Not sure Im totally the right audience. 

Recsys would be my jam but thats in Europe next year so probably not going to happen. 

Am I missing any of the big ones? Any suggestions would be great!",5,1

This is an overall good metric, often used for evaluating the ability of the model to separate the samples into, say, goods vs bads.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, assume this model is adequate and  will be used for further collection of new samples with a certain cutoff value. \*\*What should be expected Gini/AUC estimates on the newly collected sample?\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I'm noticing, on the training sample there were clear cases where the model was able to distinguish and separate it with large probabilities. On the other hand, with applied cuttoff, say, &lt;50%, the new sample with collect only those cases where no such clear separation is possible (because if it would, the case might not get collected). With such approach, for me it seems logical that the overall separation in the new sample will be lower, resulting in lower out-of-development-period Gini/AUC.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the expected behaviour in normal production environments? Am I understanding things correctly?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I understand that there are other simple metrics, such as sensitivity/specificity, hoslem.test and others, allowing for measuring and visualising True/False Positives. However, I have found that Gini/AUC is often a key metric when discussing and comparing classification models.",3,1

Apart from building, maintaining, implementing models, our data scientist does all sorts of analysis that anyone wants and helps us when the data turns up in a weird format. Needless to say, everyone is very pleased, our team keeps getting requests and we are now thinking of hiring a second person. Since we are only a small company, the inclination is to hire someone junior that can help with the workload, and provide an additional person to discuss with. Does that sound like it will work - in other words a 2 person team with one senior and one junior? Possibly even an intern or new graduate. Or would the junior person require so much supervision that it will be additional workload for our data scientist and thus defeat the purpose? 

Lets say in a few years time we manage to grow our analytics team to 3 or 4. How would you structure it? How many seniors versus juniors or mid experienced analysts?

**Automation in Industrial manufacturing:**

Todays increased level of automation in manufacturing also demands automation of material quality inspection with little human intervention. The trend is to reach human level accuracy or more in quality inspection with automation. To stay competitive, modern Industrial firms strive to achieve both quantity and quality with automation without compromising one over the other. 

**Deep Learning for Quality inspection:**

To meet industry standards quality inspectors in manufacturing firms inspect product quality usually after the product is manufactured, its a time consuming manual effort and a rejected product results in wasted upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. With the modern trend of Artificial Intelligence, industrial firms are looking to use deep learning based computer vision technology during the production cycle itself to automate material quality inspection. The goal is to minimize human intervention at the same time reach human level accuracy or more as well as optimize factory capacity, labor cost etc. The usage of deep learning is varied, from object detection in self-driving cars to disease detection with medical imaging deep learning has proved to achieve human level accuracy &amp; better. 

**What is deep learning?**

Deep learning is the field of learning deep structured and unstructured representation of data. Deep learning is the growing trend in AI to abstract better results when data is large and complex. Deep learning architecture consists of deep layers of neural networks such as input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Hidden layers are used to understand the complex structures of data. A neural network doesnt need to be programmed to perform a complex task. Gigabytes to terabytes of data are fed to the neural network architecture to learn on its own. Sample deep neural networks below:



https://i.redd.it/dum6mzj8l5221.png

**Convolution neural Network**:

Convolution neural network is a class of deep neural network commonly applied in image analysis. Convolution layers apply a convolution operation to the input passing the result to the next layer. For example an image of 1000 by 1000 pixels has 1 million features. If the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons, it ends up having 1 billion features after the first hidden layer. With that many features, its difficult to prevent a neural network from overfitting with less data. The computational and memory requirements to train a neural network with a billion features is prohibitive. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free features, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer features. There are two main advantages of using convolution layers over fully connected layers  parameter sharing and sparsity of connections. 

Convolution neural network look for patterns in an image. The image is convolved with a smaller matrix and and this convolution look for patterns in the image. The first few layers can identify lines / corners / edges etc, and these patterns are passed down into the deeper neural network layers to recognize more complex features. This property of CNNs is really good at identifying objects in images. 

Convolution neural network (aka ConvNet) is nothing but a sequence of layers. Three main types of layers are used to build ConvNet architectures: **Convolutional Layer**, **Pooling Layer**, and **Fully-Connected Layer**. These layers are stacked layers to form a full ConvNet **architecture:**

The below image clarifies the concept of a **pooling layer (Average or Max pooling)**:

Two layers each of Conv (one 3X3 filter), ReLU and Max Pooling (2X2) similar to LENET-5 architecture are applied to the crack image above. It can be seen below that the CNN architecture is focusing on the blocks of crack area and the spread of it throughout the surface:

**Case Study:**

**To maintain confidentiality of our work we are presenting an abstract use case below:**

**Problem Statement:**

Detecting bad quality material in hardware manufacturing is an error prone &amp; time consuming manual process and results in false positives (detecting a bad one as good one). If a faulty component/part is detected at the end of the production line there is loss in upstream labor, consumables, factory capacity as well as revenue. On the other hand, if an undetected bad part gets into the final product there will be customer impact as well as market reaction. This could potentially lead to irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization.

**Summary**:

We automated defect detection on hardware products using deep learning. During our hardware manufacturing processes there could be damages such scratches / cracks which make our products unusable for the next processes in the production line. Our deep learning application detected defect such as a crack / scratch in milliseconds with human level accuracy and better as well as interpreted the defect area in the image with heat maps.

**Details of our Deep Learning Architecture**:

To describe things better, we are using an example image of a circuit board with an integrated chip on it below:

**Our first approach**: 

We adopted a combination of pure computer vision approach (non-machine learning methods) to extract the region of interest (ROI) from the original image and a pure deep learning approach to detect defects in the ROI. 

**Why ROI extraction before DL**? 

While capturing the images, the camera assembly, lighting etc. was focusing on the whole area of the circuit (example images below). We are only inspecting the chip area for defects and no other areas in the circuit. We found with a few experiments that DL accuracy increased substantially when neural networks focus only on the area of interest rather than the whole area.

 First Extract Region of Interest (ROI) with Computer Vision (Non-Machine Learning Methods). Here, we go through multiple processes on the image such as gray scaling, transformations such as eroding, dilating, closing the image etc. and eventually curve out the ROI from image based on use case type / product type etc. The basic idea of erosion is just like soil erosion - it erodes away the boundaries of foreground object. Dilating is just opposite of erosion - it increases the size of foreground object. Normally, in cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. Opening is just another name of erosion followed by dilation. It is useful in removing noise. Closing is reverse of opening, dilation followed by erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects, or small black points on the object. Gradient transformation is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image. Overall, these steps help in opening up barely visible cracks / scratches in the original image. Refer the figure below :



https://i.redd.it/nj8bgt3ll5221.png

 Secondly, detect defects using deep neural networks(deep neural network (CNN)-Based Models) using proven CNN topologies such as Inception Net(aka Google Net), Res Net, Dense Net :



*Processing img ozahu8sll5221...*

Some other areas where experimentation was necessary to find the optimal architecture

 **Data Augmentation**: We have few thousand unique images labelled as defects and few thousand labelled as good ones. Augmentation is critical to avoid over-fitting the training set. We did X random crops and Y rotations (1 original image results in X\*Y augmented images). After augmentation we have X\*Y thousand defective images and X\*Y thousand good images. Referring one of original CNN papers in this context [https://](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)[papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

 **Initialization strategy** for **CNN** topologies: 

We replaced the final connected layer with our own FC layer and sigmoid layer (binary classification) as shown in the figure below: 

 

https://i.redd.it/zr1sgo7nl5221.png

Rather than random initialization of weights in each layer we considered ImageNet initialization for each CNN topology, our DL accuracy have increased substantially when we used ImageNet initialization than random.

 **Loss Function** and **Optimizer**: 

 **Cross Entropy loss**: Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .01 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0

 **SGD** and **Nesterov momentum: SGD** or stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function (loss function), its stochastic because it takes random samples from the data to do the gradient descent update. Momentum is a moving average of the gradients, it is used to update the weight of the network and it helps accelerate gradients in the right direction. **Nesterov** is a version of the momentum that is getting popular recently. 

   

https://i.redd.it/rm4s0imol5221.png

**Our Second approach**: 

**Critique to first approach**: While extracting regions of interest, it requires rewriting code whenever there are changes in product types, circuit board type/chip type (in case of our abstract example), camera setups / directions etc. This is not scalable.

**Solution:** We built an end-end two step DL architecture. In the first step, instead of a CV approach we used a DL approach to predict the ROI itself. We manually created a labelled dataset with a bounding box tool &amp; we let train a DL architecture to predict the ROI. One downside of this technique is that the labelled dataset has to be explicit and extensive enough to include all product types etc. (circuit board type/chip type in case of our abstract example) for the deep neural network to generalize well on unseen images. Refer the figures below: 

  

https://i.redd.it/kmvyolmpl5221.png

 **CNN ROI generator Loss function:**  

 We initially used a squared distance based loss function as below :

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cl28vnmql5221...*

After training a Resnet50 model for 20 epochs we achieved the following validation metric (average missed area and IOU) on the validation set :

**Ave. missed area = 8.52 \* 10-3**

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.7817**

At least, we want to improve the **IOU**

 We came up with an **Area based loss,** please refer the figure below to get an idea of how we use basic math to calculate the area of intersection between the ground truth and the predicted label. In the loss function, we want to penalize both the missed and the excess area. Ideally, we would want to penalize the missed area more than the excess area:

 

https://i.redd.it/b73qb64wl5221.png

   

 The Loss function above is differentiable so we can do gradient descent optimization on the loss function

 **CNN ROI generator Augmentation**: we simply added margins 5% (both left and right) margins during training time and test time on our predicted ROIs:

 

https://i.redd.it/btl8iniyl5221.png

 **CNN ROI generator results:**  We used Resnet50 (ImageNet initilization) toplogy and SGD + Nesterov momentum optimizer with penalty term ""lamda missed"" =2  &amp; penalty term ""lamda excess"" =1 in the **area based loss** as described above. After training the Resnet50 model for multiple epochs we want to minimize the avg. missed area and maximize the avg. IOU (Best IOU is 1). After training for 20 epochs we achieved the following on the validation set: 

**Ave. missed area = 3.65 \* 10-3** 

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.8577** 

With area based loss and augmentation(described above) we improved  our validation metric on missed area and IOU

**Experiments &amp; Benchmarks**: 

 **Experiment**:

Total # of images: Few thousand images

Data split: 80-to-10-to-10 split, using unique images only

Framework used: PyTorch &amp; Tensorflow / Keras

Weights Initialization: Pre-trained on ImageNet 

Optimizer: SGD with learning rate = 0.001, using Nesterov with momentum = 0.9

Loss: Cross entropy

Batch size: 12

Total # of epochs: 24

Image shape: 224x224x3 (except for Inception V3, which requires 299x299x3)

Criterion: Lowest validation loss

&amp;#x200B;

**Benchmarks**:

Our benchmarks with both the approaches are pretty comparable, the results with CV+DL (first) approach are little better off than the DL+DL (second) approach. We believe, our DL+DL could be better if we can create an extensive and explicit labelled bounding box dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

Following a successful completion of training, an inference solution has to be found to complete the whole end to end solution. We used Intel OpenVino software to optimize inference in different types of hardware besides CPU such as FPGA, Intel Movidius etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Inference**: 

**Intel Open Vino**: Based on convolution neural networks (CNN), the Intel Open Vino toolkit extends workloads across Intel hardware and maximizes performance:

\- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge

\- Supports heterogeneous execution across computer vision acceleratorsCPU, GPU, Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, and FPGAusing a common API

\- Speeds time to market via a library of functions and pre-optimized kernels

\- Includes optimized calls for OpenCV and OpenVX\*

Refer the following figures on Open Vino architecture:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img yqofs0lfm5221...*

Two Step Deployment:

\- Step one is to convert the pre-trained model into intermediate representations (IRs) using **Model Optimizer**: 

 **Produce a valid intermediate representation**: If this main conversion artifact is not valid, the Inference Engine cannot run. The primary responsibility of the Model optimizer is to produce the two files to form the Intermediate Representation.

 **Produce an optimized intermediate representation:** Pre-trained models contain layers that are important for training, such as the dropout layer. These layers are useless during inference and might increase the inference time. In many cases, these layers can be automatically removed from the resulting Intermediate Representation. However, if a group of layers can be represented as one mathematical operation, and thus as a single layer, the Model Optimizer recognizes such patterns and replaces these layers with one. The result is an Intermediate Representation that has fewer layers than the original model. This decreases the inference time.

The IR is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

.**xml**: Describes the network topology

.**bin**: Contains the weights and biases binary data

\- Step two is to use the **Inference Engine** to read, load, and infer the IR files, using a common API across the CPU, GPU, or VPU hardware

Open Vino documentation: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3](https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3)

**Inference Benchmarks on sample Image:**



*Processing img 75dhbp9im5221...*

It is clear that optimizing with software stack is critical to reduce the inference time. We saw 30X to 100X improvement in latency time using OpenVino software optimization. In addition, besides Intel CPU we also experimented with other Intel hardware accelerators such as Intel Movidius and FPGA. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Visualizing CNN with Heat Maps**:

Often deep neural networks are criticized for low interpretability and most deep learning solutions stop at the point when the classification of the labels are done. We wanted to interpret our results, why the CNN architecture labelled an image as good or bad (binary classification for our case study), which area in the image the CNN is focusing most.

Based on this research in MIT [https://](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf)[arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf) , a class activation map in combination with the global max pooling layer has been proposed to localize class specific image regions.

Global average pooling usually acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting during training. It is established in this research that the advantages of global average pooling layer extend beyond simply acting as a regularizer - little tweaking, the network can retain its remarkable localization ability until the final layer. This tweaking allows identifying easily the discriminative image regions in a single forward pass for a wide variety of tasks, even those that the network was not originally trained for. 

Following is a heat map interpretation using this technique on the crack on a plain surface image using Resnet-50 architecture trained on ImageNet.  As we can see, the heat map focusses on the crack area below although the architecture is not trained on such images 

 

https://i.redd.it/624ov14sm5221.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

With deep learning based computer vision we achieved human level accuracy and better with both of our approaches  CV+DL and DL+DL (discussed earlier in this blog). Our solution is unique - we not only used deep learning for classification but for interpreting the defect area with heat maps on the image itself.

Human factor cannot be completely dissociated but we can substantial reduce human intervention. An optimal model is always a fine tune between FPR (false positive rate) &amp; FNR (false negative rate) or Precision vs Recall. For our use case, we successfully automated defect detection with a model optimized for low FNR (High Recall). We substantially reduced the human review rate. With our case study we proved that we can automate material inspection with deep learning &amp; reduce human review rate.

I was selected for a project where I was informed that I would have to sit and analyse large sets of data on patents and come up with adequate data visualisations and interpretations. 

Since I have no prior experience in patent analysis and come from a relatively unrelated physics background, I constantly pestered my supervisor for help but was asked to use my own ""creativity"" to come up with ideas. He was polite  but completely unhelpful. Yesterday I got a phone call where I was informed that my group is doing an extremely poor job at things and our work is worth only being ""throw away into garbage"".

Excel also has different macros that are connect to each other.

However, it seems like VP was expecting this 93% value my model gave, even though I mentioned the poor concordance. He called a meeting for next week and I think I'm expected to explain things. Any tips for explaining that there's really no way, given the data we had available, we could give on-the-nose predictions?  


More Detail: The 93% return rate, with the poor concordance, was something I shared actually with my direct supervisor, who (theoretically) should have a decent understanding by now that you cannot bank on these models, especially early in the year without all of the data we would have later. We've had good luck with our ""late-year"" models, and concordance rates around 80-82%, but even those I would take with a grain of salt. The test population we are talking about is small (about 1,300), so we can't really account for someone say, moving away from our area, or getting sick, or any number of reasons they might not stay with us. I thought that when she shared that prediction with the VP, she would have given him the context that we can't rely on these models for *exact* numbers to return, especially since our test pop is so small, a few unexpected people leaving really throw it off. They really should be used for guidelines for identifying specific customers at risk of leaving, not averaging all of the predicted probabilities of returning to get a predicted return rate, which is what we did. Again, I meant it as a guideline with a grain of salt, but I don't think that's how people took it.

I have a background in computer science and applied math. I worked for 2 years as a data scientist and I'm quite comfortable with the following technologies; keras, sklearn, pyspark, hive and aws. 

I'm currently doing a 1-year condensed data science masters program which consists of coursework and a thesis. Starting next year, I will have three months to put put together a proposal and then afterwards 4 months to write the thesis. 

I'm having trouble thinking of the topic for three reasons;

* I can't think of a research question that is small enough in scope that can be feasibly done in short time spans I just gave. 
* Many of the recommended thesis topics are in conjunction with private companies, but truth be told all the proposed thesis topics appear to be glorified data science projects and I can't for the life of me see how I can make them into research topics. 
* If I don't work with a company I would then need use public data, so it also becomes a question of; ""is the data out there for thesis idea x?""

I wasn't sure where to post this, so if there may be a better place please let me know. I started here because this involves SQL, R, and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a company that handles a lot of data. I don't need to do much analysis on the data, but my main job is cleaning the data. I spend 90% of my time matching records across two or three large datasets to have one, functional dataset with correct data and no duplicates. I am almost 100% self taught, and I am looking to improve my workflow. The data is stored on a local SQL database (which is then accessed through MS Access), and I have had a huge success in using R to read in data from the  SQL database (using odbc). Once in R, I use dplyr (and accompanying packages such as tidyr) to merge data from multiple sources into one dataset. Then, I generally export it and check it in excel, line by line. This is where I am looking to improve my workflow. I have been teaching myself Python because I've read it can be very useful for cleaning/editing data. I am looking to add it, or switch to using Python alone if it works better. If anyone has good blogs, videos, etc. for this, I would appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

My main goals are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Flag any mismatches. Ex: In data set one, Person A spent $50 on 1-1-2018. In data set B, Person A spent $51 on 1-1-2018. I need something to flag these, so when I combing data set 1 and 2, I have one entry for Person A on 1-1-2018. I have been using anti\_join in dplyr, but I noticed that it will often miss some cases. I'm sure there must be an alternative.

2) I have been using excel to edit and change things because it was easier/faster than working in R. Are there better ways to work in R editing data, or in Python? What has worked for you?

3) Can I write into the SQL database from R or Python? I have been manually changing values within MS Access, but this is extremely time consuming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still very new, and all self taught, so any advice would go a long way. Thank you in advance!

1. My main use requires aggregating it (quite a lot; select with simple aggregated stats and with group by; possibly joining in some other data), with the result being a much more reasonable size that I can deal with.
1. My secondary use may involve running regressions on the whole data, but I can access a HPC system for that.
1. I also have a couple TBs of other data sitting around, and having another computer to store it would be helpful.

I've been thinking about building a relatively low-end linux box (i3-8100, 16GB RAM, lots of HDD storage) and letting it do the work. Point one above simply requires a few runs of a query that aggregates data (ideally one run, but I'm assuming changing research needs or missed things when running limit queries will make a few full runs necessary). Point two is a bigger job (I think), but it won't bother me if it runs for hours. Point three seems like simple file storage or more databases/tables in Postgres.

I'm new to working at this scale, even briefly, so I don't have a sense of what runtimes would look like. It is reasonable to expect points one or two to run within a few hours (per run) on that little hardware?

A little bit of background: I am currently a Master of Science, working on my thesis at one of the best universities in Canada. The program I am in is power and energy branch of electrical engineering, which as you might understand is very little to do with ML. However, after taking a ML class in summer 18, I realized that this is something I can see myself doing for quite some time. As the result, I came up with the topic for my thesis that would combine ML and DL fields along with the power branch of EE: predictive maintenance. I have been working quite hard to get my hands dirty but will really appreciate if someone can give me some more suggestions on what I can work on during the remaining time of my program (9 months).

What have I done so far: Kaggle project (the competition got closed a week later but I still learned a lot), statistics (shaum's outline and occasionally, look at Elements of statistical learning for more insight), linear algebra (covered in undergraduate), theoretical foundations of ML (what is regression, what is decision tree, what is Lasso), python with packages

What I plan to do: working with dirty dataset (clean it, etc... Required for my thesis); 2 more kaggle projects (one more for practice and one more to actually compete).

I would really appreciate if someone who is in the field can tell me what would make my CV more attractive for potential employers.

I'm looking to advance my career, so beyond that, what programs / programming languages would Data Analysts reccomend becoming familiar with? I've looked online and seen lots of name bandied about (Hadoop, Tableau, Power BI), but I'm not quite sure where to start with them. 

Ideally, I'd like to stick to the Data Analysis side of things, and not so much Data Science. Am I kiddig myself there, and is it best for me to learn some of that stuff?

I'm also guessing that most Data Analysts know Python or R (or both), and which one would you reccomend learning first.

I am going to graduate with a MSc in Biology next semester, but I have decided I want to transition into data science.

Throughout my research I started learning python and became really interested in statistical inference and data analysis.

My background is mainly in genetics and molecular biology / neuroscience.

I have a descent understanding of applied inferential statistics. However, I have little to no experience with linear algebra. And it has been a while since i did calculus (differential is fine, but integration, sequences/ series, has been a while).

I also have a basic handle on python.

I am looking for advice on what to focus on in this journey first.

How much should i focus on the math skills? 
I found this [post ](https://towardsdatascience.com/essential-math-for-data-science-why-and-how-e88271367fbd)which lists many useful topics in math for data science, and the free courses that cover them, but it is a lot of content (which im not afraid of, i just want to prioritize properly).

Or should I just take the python data science MOOCs and rely on the theory i learn from them?

I also plan to volunteer at some of my university labs to get data science experience.

ALSO very important question:
What would be more valuable - 

1) taking a condensed data science Masters course? (which may be hard to get in considering im coming from biology)

2) taking a Continuing Education Degree in Data science

3) Learning my skills through MOOCs / auditing courses / trying to get any work experience during that time period.

I don't need a library/package to analyze MNIST or iris. No one does. We need a library with general documentation about ALL data.

I want to buy all 3 stocks at once and sell them at once. Essentially I want to know what would have been the best time of day to buy and the best day to sell to get the maximum return in a date range of two weeks. This should all be based on data as we would be looking at the previous two weeks prices.

I started pulling data and am looking at the percentage difference (of the past two weeks) of one stock if I was to hypothetically buy it one day then sell it stock another, that part is a lot of data but is easy to see what the largest positive percentage difference is which would represent the highest return on investment.

The catch is that I want to buy all three stocks on a day and then sell all of them together on a later day. They MUST all be bought/sold together. I want a program that can look at all the percentage differences of a stock being bought/sold in the past 2 weeks and comparing them to the two other stocks to determine the best day to buy all three stocks and the best time to sell the three stocks that would have the highest percentage of combined return.

Again this would be off all historical pricing so I would have the open/close price of each stock. Anyone understand/know where I should start?? Thanks for reading this far

I already tried at the MachineLearning community but got no answer, so I try it here as well. 

I have a huge set of data curves (several thousands of points per curve  over time). According to few subjective, rather non-quantitive rules,  some of them are fine, others are not. You probably see where this is  going. I want to take a full curve as a feature and label them as 'ok'  and 'not ok' and train my data set in order to predict in the future  whether the curve can be validated or not.

What  is the proper ansatz here? I think a binary classification fits quite  well here, however most of the time I find examples where the features  are not a set of points but single quantities like mean or width. Due to  the wiggly trends of the curves, I would like to avoid to fit a  function to the curves, as this would require a large set of parameters  and the error would be quite large.

Looking forwards for help! :- )

For my project, I sought to answer the question ""how might the combination of an NFL prospect's NFL combine results and college performance statistics be used to linearly model their NFL success?"". For this, my data consisted of prospects from the 2000-2013 NFL combines as well as their combine results, respective college performance statistics, and NFL success defined by a continuous metric known as AV. Because different positions have different college performance statistics (i.e. quarterbacks have passing yards), I broke the data up by position and made separate models for each. The models for each position used AV as the response variable and a combination of college statistics and combine metrics as a these explanatory variables found using backward selection.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I have to include a statistical analysis section in the final paper. For this, I did 4 things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I ran many single variable regressions for each position using AV as the response and the individual combine metrics as the explanatory variable (i.e. for wide receivers there was AV \~ 40 yard dash, AV \~ bench press reps, etc.). Among the regressions I created, I contextualized the results of the ones with significant regressor coefficients.
2. I did the same thing as above, only using the individual college performance statistics as the explanatory variables (i.e. for running backs there was AV \~ rush yards, AV \~ rush touchdowns, etc.).
3. For each position, I made a many regression models by having each combine metric be the single response variable and the explanatory variables being a combination of college performance statistics (i.e. for wide receivers there was 40 yard dash \~ receiving yards + receiving touch downs, 40 yard dash \~ yards per catch, Vertical \~ receiving yards, etc.). I contextualized the results of the significant models. I essentially was looking at if combine results could modeled by college statistics.
4. I finally just used backward selection to create a best multiple regression model for AV for each position with the explanatory variables being a combination of college performance statistics and combine metrics. This is where my question was directly answered. The models were bad, but I just had to reflect on possible reasons why and do residual analysis and whatnot.

The bad thing is, I need to justify why I even bothered doing the first 3 parts of my statistical analysis. I need a purpose, no matter how abstract, for doing what I did because I cannot take it out at this point. My question is, how can I justify each step in relation to my research question/goal or any related subquestion/goal? ",4,1

I'm a front-end web developer who primarily works with JS and D3. Loading a lot of data with D3 and doing array manipulation in the browser is sometimes tedious and intensive, so I'd like to find another way to explore my data and get some quick insights.

I enrolled in a data science course this semester with R, and I've had a lot of trouble. I really struggled with the R syntax, coming from JavaScript. Also, the fact that R has a million libraries (tidyverse, etc) that all have their distinct syntax really threw me off. Also, the instructor didn't spend much time on the fundamentals and was more interested in statistics and applications.

However, I do recognize R for its statistical power to make doing cursory dives into data very easy, as well as visualizing data. But it just wasn't intuitive for me, at all. I'm used to imperative programming styles and R just seemed like a ""run this line and check if it worked"" type of thing. Not at all like JS.

I've read a lot about python and how it is a very good general purpose language, and has some libraries like Pandas which are quickly catching up to the functionality of R.

Is it worth abandoning the effort I've put into R and trying to learn python? I'm not planning to learn more complicated stuff like machine learning as of now, I just want to be able to crunch and clean data. Or should I just go ahead and stick with R, and perhaps find a better resource online?

Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to learn both Python and R at this moment. I'd rather just concentrate on one and learn it really well. My ultimate goal is to continue down the data viz / front-end developer path. I see Python a lot more in job applications than R. Is python's programming style more intuitive? Is it worth ditching R?",8,1

It's not as if machine learning/AI didn't exist a decade ago, was it just not being used in industry and the more basic data analyst role where advance statistics/mathematics knowledge is not required was enough to answer all business questions.

I have changed a lot of details in my explanation so I don't out my company, but I hope it still makes sense. I am not in any sense a data scientist, just trying to answer a question at work.

I work for a company that's struggled to expand our user base beyond ""trendy"" neighborhoods in our city. In the few years we've been around we have had somewhat steady user growth in certain neighborhoods with spikes when we got mentioned on a local blog or something. A few months ago our service was mentioned on local TV and we started getting more user registrations, including from parts of the city we've never served before. We have been debating whether this represents ""breaking through"" into the mainstream and gaining in places we would never have before the coverage, or whether the numbers are too small to be meaningful. That is, are these just users that were bound to join given enough time, or is the distribution of users from that period qualitatively different?

My thought initially was: create a rough prediction of how many registrations we'd expect in a zip code if the new users had followed our normal distribution, and compare the expected # of new users to the actual #. This gave some insight on a few neighborhoods where we already had users and gained more. But it does not help at all with neighborhoods where we had zero users, or only had one and gained one (wow, this is 700% of expected growth!)

I am an Engineering student and am currently working on a Big Data project. I am doing the project one of the Computer Labs in my College (5 PCs - 1 Master, 4 Slaves - Ubuntu 18.04 - Hadoop 2.7.7).

For the first part of the project, I successfully configured the Multinode cluster and carried out the required tasks (Analyzing a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) using a [K-Nearest Neighbor Alogrithm](https://github.com/vinitS101/knn/blob/master/KnnPokerhand.java) in Java).

For this I used this [blog](http://kishorer747.blogspot.com/2014/10/setting-up-hadoop-241-multi-node.html) as a reference.  (Additionally, if you think this isn't an ideal configuration, I would love to get some tips and feedback so that my Hadoop cluster works better).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I plan to carry out the same analysis but with Spark on the same Hadoop Cluster. I tried to follow this [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/hadoop/install-configure-run-spark-on-top-of-hadoop-yarn-cluster/) to set it up (Note: I used the appropriate spark version) and it kind of worked. Spark does seem to start but there are numerous errors.

I am a beginner with very basic knowledge in this. It took me about 2-3 weeks to fully understand, configure and run my Hadoop cluster.

I would really appreciate if you could:

1. Help point out the issues with the resources I linked and how can I rectify them.
2. If you have any better tutorials, blogs or guides that I can read/watch and understand this better please share the links.
3. Am I even doing this right? I have had no actual courses on these topics in College and I am just doing this because the field of Big Data, Machine Learning, etc interest me.
4. How does Cloudera,, Hortonworks etc actually work? I have full systems with ubuntu and not VMs and I have been unable to find a guide or blog that could help me setup either of those services for my cluster of 5 Computers. If these are any good, I would really appreciate it if you could explain it a little and/or link some blogs, guides or tutorials I could refer to.

My only issue with these ms in data science programs, is that they seem like very niche roles, would a traditional CS degree leave me with more options? The only issue with Brandeis is the price, then again everything is expensive nowadays when it comes to education. Any advice is appreciated.",1,1

I want to be data scientist. I am currently on second year of bachelor's in ""quantitative methods in economy and information systems"" on Warsaw School of Economics. I already do subjects of third year, so i'll be done in half a year. The curriculum is not so practical for job of data scientist. All my free time i spent on learning everything from Kaggle, so i can find my first job/internship on my third year of bachelor's (i will have time, as third year will be there only formally, and only two or three subjects will be left for me to attend to, because i will do 3 years in 2 years). 

After that I want to emigrate from Poland to make money. I have a deal with my parents though. It is not important why, but i have to make master's degree beacause they want to. I want to work though. So the problem is to find a country where I will have well payable data scientist job while studying useful master's and where education is cheap (so no UK, Australia for example). After master's I'll move again to the country where i will find the most profitable job( i think of Canada, Australia, UK, but each of them does not have cheap education, so it will be after the master's), work my ass off there for 7 years untill I am 30 years old. Save as much as I can and come back to Poland, buy two flats and one RV and not give a fuck anymore.

Where should i go?

Criticize my plan as much as you can, I have an open mind. I only want to win life.

But, for a variety of reasons, I can't build out the existing model to incorporate this data and select features from there. I'm having to do this in a silo. 

So far, I figured out the probability that a customer makes a purchase when a customer visits a particular page versus when they don't. For example, 65% of people who visit our ""about us"" page make a purchase vs 15% of those that don't.

But there are other challenges. First, some pages are visited more than other pages, so I need a way to balance effect size and frequency. And, there is a time consideration as well. For example, the ""order review"" page has a huge effect (75% vs 10%), but it is visited relatively late in the customer's timeline. I need a way of weighting earlier interactions more heavily. 

Any ideas for how to help screen features? I'm just looking to be pointed in a general area.

I started a new job recently at a small company which tries to give more emphasis in using data. Because they are a small company, with a niche product and a big pie of the market, they chose instead of spending a lot of money to get an experienced employee, to get someone that can grow and learn with them during their ""journey"" in exploring the benefits of using data.

The first stage is to make data about the company's products easily available to everyone at the company. To this effect, I am currently developing several reports in Power BI so that in the future the IT team and me won't have to take time of our responsibilities to provide ad hoc data requests to the other employees. This part is easy enough and is going to be completed in a few months, so no help needed for this.

After that the fun (and hard) part begins where I will have to try to provide my own insights gained from studying/analysing the data and hopefully try to implement ML projects such as  predicting the performance of our users, offer a more personalised product, etc.

As there is no one experienced on this field at the company, basically I am on my own and I can follow whichever route I believe is the best. So it would be really helpful if you could offer me some help on where to start.

First of all, I was asked to research what software I could use. My first idea was to learn Python but I don't know if at least at the beginning, to make things easier and the progress faster, would be better to use an analytics suite like SPSS or SAS or whatever. So any recommendations on that? What do you believe the best place to start would be? As a note, I believe the budget would be something like 10000-15000 per year at the maximum, at least initially.

Second,where to start learning? I did a Masters recently, not directly relevant to data science, but I took some modules on it and that's why I also decided to get this job. So although I have some experience with machine learning, statistics, and doing a small project using SPSS, SAS EG &amp; EG, etc. I am in no way an expert. I guess what software I am going to use would play some importance, for example if I use Python, I will have to learn Python, but in general can you suggest some good books or online courses that you believe is a good place to start for someone already knowing some stuff. I believe something that also offers the chance to implement small scale case studies relevant to real business problems would be very beneficial.

Finally, how do you go about getting insights? For stuff like ML projects such as  predicting the performance of users, although it might be difficult to implement at least it is more or less clear where to start or what you have to do. But when trying to gain insights from data, where do you start? From visualising the data in Power BI I have already found some interesting trends/patterns, but how do I go from there? Do I run descriptive statistics? Try to find correlations between the data? Look for clusters that are not visible by naked eye?

Sorry for the long post and thank you to everyone that is going to read it and an even better thanks to people that are going to reply.

I love self-help posts, don't get me wrong. But the majority of these blogs usually make a list of useful resources and provide nearly nothing else aside from a brief description of the course.  A lot of these resource lists are well known or broadly accessible, so this isn't entirely new (or even useful) information anymore.

What could be useful is, commenting in particular about \*\*HOW\*\* a certain resource was useful\*\* - (e.g, ""Look up Khan Academy's Linear Algebra course, and you'll understand Chapter X of Elements of Statistical Learning"")  or "" 3 Blue 1 Brown is excellent at explaining this particular concept here \[link\], and with this you can see what is happening in PCA.

so i've been modeling for a little over 3 months so i'm still fairly new. my question pertains to 

feature engineering; i've explored creating a small polynomial dictionary and then using a lasso ( or mixed lasso/ridge ) in order to trim coefficients, which didn't lead to the best results.

it seems that in the end, what i find most helpful is to run an decision tree model and a quick linear regression to get a general idea for what the main variables are in the dataset, and perhaps which terms might need further exploration from there.

i've had very small gains from using the polynomial - basis expansion, but have found that finding key features and then trying to use some logic in order to derive some predictors has done some work. also some gains have been found in creating ratios from variables (like admission rate to predict graduation rate).

my last question would be, what are your thoughts on using clustering in order to derive a cluster assignment as a variable? seems like you could just use the average distance metric and assumed your cluster's are fixed, which seems like it would give the right response as your coefficient would be based somewhat off of the cluster's location in fit.

what have been your experiences in feature engineering?

I enrolled in a well known Canadian university's data science masters program ( I am not going to share the name since it is all my fault). It's geared towards working professionals, so classes are in the evenings. 6 semesters/term program, I am in the 4th one and just about done with the final exams.  Two more semesters left, but last (6th) semester is only half, and is meant for Capstone presentations. So essentially, next semester is the last.   My work is paying 65% of the cost.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited at first, but then kind of zoned out and did the minimal work.  The program is not difficult. You can get by if you follow the notes and practice the problems done in class. While it is a Masters program, it is not exactly like a \*real\* Masters degree. Emphasis is on practical problem solving, rather than theory. Many years back in undergrad (Comp Sci), I took one Masters level course, and there a big difference between teaching styles.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's all my fault for putting in the minimal work. I can barely make heads or tails out of ARIMA, exponential smoothing, PCA, FA, neural networks, etc. At best, I can create linear regression models without having to reference anything.  Since I use Python at work, I can clean up the data pretty easily.

&amp;#x200B;

People at work have been asking me how my degree is going. They think I am learning some futuristic Starwars like science. Some people said this is like graduating with a degree in computer science in 1991, data science is that big (their words, not mine).  I have been finding reasons to avoid people, which is wrecking havoc on already bad social anxiety. These days I start having trouble breathing and swallowing. If I quit my job before 2 years, I would owe them \~$35K, which I don't have.  I am so disappointed in myself. I am going to let everyone down when they find out I can only do linear regression. I put my wife and kids through all of this. They wait for me late till I come home on my class days. Life was so much better  before, now i got this burden on my shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

Although if you are wondering, the program itself, and many others like it is pretty good. I mean pros and cons to everything. A few students have already moved to Data Scientist roles within their companies. One student got promoted to manager of their companys new analytics team. And here I am wishing I could turn back time.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of ""lack of experience in the field"". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. ""You don't know Google AdWords?"" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the ""experienced"" category of job applicants and I'm ""entry level"". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's do a data science masters!

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

A pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.

&amp;#x200B;

Second class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a medium post.

&amp;#x200B;

Third Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've learned:

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to them I do full-stack engineering. I'm learning that right now data science jobs are gatekept by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at. By the way, even with a graduate degree, you better have industry experience or else you'll get bounced by a marketing or finance person in your data science interview, or worse: low-balled.

&amp;#x200B;

Im self learning on Hive and Hadoop, and diving into ML. On top of that, I have previous work experience with Google Analytics and Ads(certified), Tableau (Was a full time business analyst), and previously did freelance work. Also, I am self taught in programming(I was really into C#, but handy with front end). 

The only downside...No Degree. As in I do not have a Bachelors Degree and as I work more towards Data Science this becomes more of a road block  as many places require Masters and above now. 

I like education, I started out as a chemical engineering major at a great school, but it all got away from me quickly. I transferred, and was aimless...then I got into Digital marketing, stumbled into data analytics and now here I am. I guess I figured why go into debt when I can make more money working.

I am a 19 year old undergraduate in Australia and will be a data analyst intern in under 2 months, I finish my CS degree before July and I am quite possibly the youngest Research Assistant at my university, started when I was 18 and the role is predominantly communicating technical knowledge / visualization to non technical people, and soon I start contributing to a technical project started by PhDs.  

Little more background: I have just completed all 3 data courses in my university (2 are part of my data science major) and have done the same mathematics / statistics course as everyone (in first year).  If I were to rate myself on key topics, I'd say:

&amp;#x200B;

Programming : 5/10 as I'm only **really** proficient at Python, but with motivation I can master other technologies with some sweat. P.S. I do know R, query languages, C, Java, JS, HTML and CSS, but I would not dare call myself technically proficient at any of them

Mathematics : 5/10 and willing to improve to 7-8/10 if money motivated  

Machine learning : 5/10, I know how to, where to and when to apply some models but with the lack of math intuition, I'm limited as to how far I can understand (i.e. deepest I've ever gone is building a neural network from scratch)

Business, leadership and problem solving skills : 10/10 

Presentation / communication : 10/10

Confidence (due to ambition) : 10/10

&amp;#x200B;

Even my own Data Scientist mentor / supervisor (also my data lecturer) at my university has called me a little crazy for \\ considering to jump the queue that most follow which is data analytic &gt; data scientist.  My belief is that the analytic lacks the business sense / confidence / communication skills the scientist has, as the analytic is much more technically proficient. 

I don't believe it is possible to sink hundreds of hours becoming a data guru without sacrificing business skills (as it also takes time to build solid communication skills, need experience presenting to large audiences in order to present well to small audiences). From what I gather data scientists are leaders, and they lead the technical data analysts (in no way do I mean to undermine them) into applying models which the scientist can infer from **better** (this is the problem solving) than than the analyst. And I know that some places use the analyst and scientist term interchangeably but I believe there is a linearly separable model that describes the two. 

My question is: what is the youngest data scientist you have ever heard of? 

I should also mention I dress and talk like a 23-25 year old and I don't look like I just graduated from High School in 2016 thus I wouldn't look like an outlier in a professional office environment.

A data technician is a different than a full stack data scientist, data engineer, architect, analyst, business intelligence manager or data technician. *Engineers* apply science and mathematics knowledge. *Technicians* perform tests, collect data, and assist *engineers*.  They have a know how but are less fluent in applied mathematics, even if they know enough to understand what kind of data the scientist is willing to receive.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having trouble in learning how t use xgboost for a programmng project I am currently doing. I tried to look online but found example using python but I am using rstudio. I mainly want to boost a decision tree and most examples I have seen are for like logistic. I thought it would be cool to implement in my project, but I settled for teh gbm library boost instead which makes me a bit sad. If anyone here can point me in the correct direction that be much appreciated. And if anyone here knows how to use it, help would be appreciated. This is for a machine learning project.

|:-|:-|
|red is warm|0.5|
|blue is cold|1|
|yellow is better than red|\-0.5|

The basic operation is to loop through each word, and add the score value if the word is present in the scoring data. 

    IF text contains red then score + 0.5
    IF text contains yellow then score + -1
    etc...

The operation is simple enough that I could probably write it in any programming language. 

Is there a no brainer fast\\best practice for such tasks? Is vectorization an obvious better approach? Should I avoid slower languages such as python and go for C? Is this something that would require a cloud computing platform?

I have the option to go to UCI for Spring 2019 or UC Berkeley for Fall 2019 semester. 

I am coming from a private university, while competitive, it isn't as cut throat for classes as Berkeley. I also hear too many horror stories about students at Berkeley, like getting beat up by homeless people. Berkeley is more recognizable and more prestigious, which is one of the reasons why I am considering it.

I am just conflicted because UCI is telling me if I want their spot, I have to accept before the end of February. I would get free housing there, however, it just seems very boring. I've driven around UCI and it looks like a giant business park. 

Career goals is to get into the data science industry and maybe pursue a graduate degree after working for a while. I have 4 software engineering internships (plus two more lined up in 2019) so I am not too concerned about trying to get internships, but I am more curious to where I would thrive more.  Does anyone have any opinions about which program will be better?

This includes questions around learning and transitioning such as:

* **Learning resources** (e.g., books, tutorials, videos)
* **Traditional education** (e.g., schools, degrees, electives)
* **Alternative education** (e.g., online courses, bootcamps)
* **Career questions** (e.g., resumes, applying, career prospects)
* **Elementary questions** (e.g., where to start, what next)

We encourage practicing Data Scientists to visit this thread often and sort by new.

Sometimes this even comes from myself feeling ""guilty"" about taking time ""off"".... but by ""off"" I mean just relaxing after working many hours. 

I""m sure it depends a lot on what individual team you work with, but have you experienced a lot of this in your position?

We currently send them to the closest store to their house, not accounting for where they go during the day. It is weird in mind to use a RS for this as we cant recommend all the stores to each customer, as distances play a role. The stores can be viewed as homogenous, offering the same products at each. Ultimately I have access to a huge amount of data for each customer, but the system is to be run prior to direct mail being sent, so it will not perform on the fly predictions on a website. The recommended stores address would be printed on the mailer.

I can triangulate which store is on there way to work by geolocating both address, find the distance between the stores and their various address, etc. 

I have been told the sky is the limit on what I can do for this project, but I am at a loss on the best method to proceed. LARS seems like the closest thing I can find to this, but with the stores being homogenous it just seems out of place to me.

I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get a machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there that explain this in as easy of a manner as the articles you've created

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",114,1

The way I've been raised to think is that a 'scientist'  in a field is a person that has or had a significant impact in that field. For example, that person might have introduced a new concept (Lecun's convolutional neural networks, or Goodfellow's GANs), or they may have solved a long standing problem, or simply made some advancements in the field.

I've seen so many people on LinkedIn, towards data science, etc... call themselves data scientists. Most of them barely have any formal training in that field at all, or like me, have a masters in data science or a related field and have been working in the data science industry for a few months/years.

But now I dont know how to proceed. Senior management has asked that I implement this process on an ongoing basis. How? Although I like to think I have an in-depth understanding of the models necessary for this task, what I dont have is an understanding of the tools necessary to automate this process. I dont expect and hand outs, but being pointed in the right direction would be a huge help. What tools/skills would be necessary to:
Automatically run my scripts in R while
Connecting to my data source to retrieve the most up to date info (sql server)
And alerting people of the outputs (e-mail with results of latest run, or posted to a dashboard, etc.)?

As I am pioneering these efforts and all of my courses have been theory on using the models, how do I implement this into a real life scenario?

I'm a 24 years old software developer from Italy currently enrolled in a MSc in Data Science with a bachelors in CS. As already said in the title, I'm at my final year of study, with 3 exams passed out of 12, and I've started realizing this degree is something of an attempt to follow the data science hype train. From all of these courses, I can feel the utility of only 4, regarding Python, R, SQL and Statistics, whilst the others are too much generic from a person like me who is already working from 3 years in the IT field and quite knows how things are going on. For example, I have a course about Biology, one about User Interface Interaction, Psychology or something really too much mathematical without a direct correlation with data science.  

At this point, since I can only study at night, I'm wondering if spending another 3 years (assuming I can realistically study for at most 4-6 exams at year) in terms of time and money would be a good option, without considering the off days, the bureaucracy and so on because this university is 180km far from my city. This does not mean to stop studying data science at all, but instead switching to MOOCs, certifications, maybe online degrees if they are valuable, with the purpose of building my own *portfolio* on GitHub and constantly participating on Kaggle competitions trying to improve myself as possible. Of course, the choice of going on with the university is the safest, because we all know that a degree is something companies can trust, but when it comes to data science is it still true or, considering my job and the field itself,  it is better to focus on learning as much as I can about the topic and using this knowledge to create projects I can show to people?

We created a prototype in python using tensorflow and realized that performance of whole system is very slow .

Now we have to optimize this . One approach is to optimize it in python . Another is port this to lower languages like C/c++ and optmize. We are targetting two classes of processors one from Nvidia and another from ARM platforms . Although i know Nvidia's processors are ARM based, we are targetting to heavily use GPUs here. And other one ARM, to use CPU mainly.

We are using YOLO architecture of DNN . 

Any quick paths /ideas to optmize from this prototype model to production ready code.?

I also read blogs stating C++ and Caffe model is well suited for production ready code, is that so ?

Can you please provide some inputs on this .",4,1

My mentor this quarter is working on his PhD in Stochastic Control Theory, and just taught a convex optimization class this last quarter (so I was thinking of heading down that road), but I was wanting to get some feedback from all of you out there as to what you think a good route to go would be.

I work as a data scientist in a big company, at senior level. I have a PhD and also a data science fellowship from a prestigious/well known program. I have a bit of background in software engineering too, so can write production quality code.

When I joined this company, most of the basic business processess are broken and the data was just not in the right shape to do any data science or even advanced analytics. Frustrated with the quality of data and lack of it, I helped build data sources that are crucial to the business. This involved me working in small teams developing applications and databases tailored for the business needs. I should say that, the purpose of these applications could not have been replaced by commercially available software. I did a few data science projects on the side but the biggest impact I made was making these business applications. 

Fast forward 2 years, the three products that I have designed and built are showing great value and expected to generate a lot of lost revenue. And we have data of good quality to do data science. Great for the company but not for me, as this meant I have not done data science for 2 years and built a reputation for my other skills. 

Now, I am in a weird place where my title is data science but company values my software engineering skills and I perceive myself as solution/technical architect. 

I am confused on my future progression here. Should I just jump to another company and start fresh ? Should I force my existing company to change my role into what I perceive? Should I ask them to assign me more data science roles? 

I am also a bit concerned about the seniority here. I put 2 years into this and don't want to lose the momentum. Anyone with similar problems?

I am a 3rd year university student studying Business and Computer Science, and I recently took a relational databases courses where I studied ER models, logical database design and normalization, Relational Algebra, Datalog, SQL, and data warehouses (star vs snowflake schema, apirori algorithm,etc.). I have become very interested in working with data and building data pipelines, the ETL process and hence started to look into data engineering/science. However, I am having a hard time finding a clear distinction between the role of a Data engineer vs a data scientist. Here are a few questions i have:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Who performs the ETL process? the data engineering or the data scientist? (every resource I read gives me a different answer

2) Why is the ETL process so difficult? Does data cleaning really take that much time?

3) What are the main responsibilities of a data engineer besides building data pipeline and ETL? For an established company like Google for example with major data pipelines and an established infrastructure, what does the role of a data engineer look like in such a massive company?

4) Do data engineers perform any data analysis? (I am very interested in the business side of things as well, and I am hoping to put the business knowledge i gain from school into use as well, however I am not very interested in heavy mathematical/statistical models used for things like Machine Learning,  but I am willing to learn if necessary)

5) Can an employee perform both the tasks of a data engineer and data scientist?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, any recommended resources or types of personal projects to practice data engineering and break into the field? I have some experience with web and app development, but I have no idea on how to get started on data engineering and if there are any recommended courses online I can take (on things like Hadoop which I have no idea about) to get a better look on the field.

530,2018-12-17,2018,12,17,16,a6xj64,Random Forest Classifier (Numeric Data).,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a6xj64/random_forest_classifier_numeric_data/,ath_ank,1545030215,"Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning method used for classification, regression, and clustering as well. It uses a collection of Trees, where each tree votes on the outcome. In the case of classification, the forest gives the class voted by the maximum number of trees. In the case of regression, the output is the average of the outcomes of all the trees.

Suppose there are twenty different possible predictor variables. If you create a single decision tree, it may have some bias. Alternatively, in Random Forest, you choose a random sample of 4 variables (say) from all variables and build a tree. Repeat this for a number of times, say 10. Now, you have 10 different trees (lets call a forest) where different variables have been used and created different accuracy level.

Now, these trees give votes to each variable based on the outcomes, this gives a good idea about variable importance and finally gives the value of the predictor variable.

&amp;#x200B;

***Classification and Regression***

Each tree is given a sample of the full data set with replacement. A subset of features is used to create the tree to the maximum depth possible. The data points and features are then used to create the respective CART trees.

&amp;#x200B;

***Clustering***

The dissimilarity measure between the data points is used to create the distance matrix. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoid) clustering is performed on this distance matrix (using an input on a number of clusters) to create the final clusters. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4tnrmfedes421.jpg

***Practice dataset***

To practice on a dataset, you can visit [Analyttica TreasureHunt](https://learn.analyttica.com).

&amp;#x200B;

***Input and Output***

In Analyttica TreasureHunt, you can run random forest clustering by selecting the target and predictor variables. The data should not contain any missing value. Target variable has to a class variable.

The output of the function has a confusion matrix to show classification accuracy and the variable importance measures. It also runs a 5-fold cross-validation and gives the summary of the result. The predicted class is created in a new field in the dataset.

I'm going to create a logistic regression model as I'm predicting  yes / no
from some data. The size of the dataset is ~700 rows, so it's pretty small. 

There are about 30 variables, mainly categorical, some ordinal, and a couple of
continuous, but I think there were about 4 or 5 that were significant from
chi-squared tests. 

I would like another approach to model with, that I could compare and contrast
with Logistic regression. I'm not sure what to go with though. 

The goal is to have something that makes sense for this data, but not
necessarily something that performs amazingly. My main focus is accessibility
and learning. So I need to be able to understand and explain the model
(accessibility), and I would like to use a model that provides some groundwork
for industry kind of stuff (learning), hopefully.

Something that leverage's reasonably basic linear algebra, statistics, and
calculus is fine. I can programme.

I was thinking about using k-nearest neighbours. As this is meant to be pretty
simple and I think (?) there are techniques and concepts in it that might be
useful for me if I continue to read about further models after this project.
Another was Linear Discriminant Analysis, mainly because I thought it was a
'classic'. There was also decision trees.

Any suggestions are welcome. ",23,1

It seems there are two possible approaches:
a) count of calls / (last call date - first call date)
b) count of calls / (current date - first call date)

Both of these approaches would bias results depending on the length of time a person was eligible. For example, using (b) above would result in an artificially lower frequency for members who are no longer eligible by adding additional time to the estimate. (a) would artificially increase the estimate by not accounting for eligible time before and after the first and last call dates, respectively.

Method (b) seems reasonable if assuming members are active if in the data, irrespective of the last call date.

Below is what I posted in the AI subreddits.

I am super excited for the possibilities of AI applications in the near future and have been trying to run along with its rapid development. I have been trying to learn everything about it since 3 years ago and even changed majors to Computer Science. I've taken AI which covers things like particle filtering.

The field is so big that I don't even know where to hone in on, since everything is exciting and useful, but some more than others. I feel like we're in the area where we don't even know what we don't know.

What I've done:

I have dedicated myself to finishing Computer Science degree at a top school, even though I'm not that strong technically. Don't think I have the grades for grade school or time. Took formal AI course, that teaches essentially computational rationality.

Have many personal projects I'm trying to build out with Google AIY kits involving vision and voice. So vision as a sort of intelligent camera detecting by classification. Voice to make use of some kind of self improvement of sound, like hone in on a specific sound and become more accurate ( that's the idea but trying to implement ).

Entrepreneurship. I am always trying to find applications. Since I love building IoT and as a side effect collect lots of data. This starts to blur into whether it's data science or AI that makes use of the data or both.

Going to spend my winter break learning Tensorflow and how to use it from scratch to a working model. I was thinking of optimizing the last layers of a provided model, but I'm not sure which would teach me machine learning and TF more. From scratch or optimizing the last layer.

I know everything takes time, but I want to become efficient and grow as fast as possible since there's SO MUCH! I just want to be strong with Machinelearning and AI. It's super exciting and I want to be knowledgable but also able to apply it to practical uses.

Any tips and suggestions on how I should grow effectively would be much appreciated. I don't even know if knowing stuff like joint particle filtering is useful.

I'm looking for an algorithm or technique that I can go search the web and learn more about but I don't even know what to start searching for. Here's what my problem looks like. 

I have some data that looks like this:

|*Machine ID*|*Output Day 1*|*Output Day 2*|*...*|*Output Day N-1*|*Output Day N*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|00000|55|56|...|78|86|
|00001|45|44|...|89|94|

Imagine that each row is some machine and the columns are the outputs on day i. We have many such machines/rows. Now the problem is given an arbitrary machine and its data for Day 1... Day N-1, we want to predict its output on Day N.   


Now this looks a lot like a time series except I'm used to time series being a *single* series of numbers and you're just trying to predict the next few numbers -- rather than having multiple series that behave similarly and you should be able to learn a general model from all of them . On the flip side, I could treat it as a simple regression problem (to learn to predict day N) but what happens if I want to predict N and then N+1 and so on? Treating it as a regression would throw away the time relationships. 

Finally, what if I have other properties of the machine that I'm trying to use in the prediction (i.e. let's say how old it is, how much oil it has left, etc). 

I feel like there is a known technique here that I should be able to STFW for but I don't know what it's called. Are recurrent  NN what I am looking for? ",0,1

Leverage the Past,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a78boa/are_you_missing_the_boat_on_data_science_leverage/,simongaspard,1545112558,"I am one of many mid-career people transitioning to data science after spending less than ten years working as a general manager. It's definitely not for the money. Working as a Jr. Data Scientist, Data Engineer, or Machine Learning Engineer would be a pay cut at this point (except for those unicorns in Silicon Valley and New York.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am doing that proves the most rewarding is adding technical skills to my portfolio. With automation improvements allowing non-data scientists to work with data increasing, specialization will be essential for job security. ""True"" Data Scientists aren't born out of MS programs with 0-2 years experience (after mine, I felt equipped to work as a ""True"" Data Analyst on an Analytics Team or within an Analytics Department). ""True"" Data Scientists (in my opinion and through observation) is they are grown (internally) or sourced from academia or are ex-academics who lost hope after living destitute while earning their education but somehow took a few more courses in data science and leveraged related experience from a completely different industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

But there is hope for those career transitioning people; one thing people often do, and shouldn't do, is mistakenly overlook their past experiences in their industry (that they may love or hate) after completing their data science education. After my program, I went back to the same industry. No new industry learning curve, you no longer have to take a pay cut earning $20K-$40K less than your previous career, now you are in a more senior role (e.g., Director, Chief, Senior Manager, VP, President) responsible for playing an active part in changing how your company solves problems using data. Leverage the skills you have, the industry you know best, whether you like it or not, and focus on optimization, change management, and how your company uses data to solve its problems. You may find that you are the in-house unicorn that the company never knew it wanted or needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be the champion Project Manager (or assume such a role). However, from personal experience, be smart about staying in your current company unless you love it. My last company did offer a lateral move to a new position, a small salary bump, but not much else. I had to switch companies after two years (since they paid for part of my degree) to see an ROI. Changing companies led to a substantial offer - same industry - different title - different company.

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend anyone considering transitioning mid-careers to hold fast, earn your STEM degree (part-time, evening, full-time if you can). The ROI is worth it. You will be turning down offers left and right (within your past industry - in my experience). You can also break into a new sector and still be successful; many in my cohort completely changed their industry (most were 30 or above with 5-10 years experience at the time). The more senior level candidates had the highest offers. We had two recent undergraduate students in the class who accepted more technical roles (e.g. Data Analyst, Product Analyst, and something else). I don't remember, it was part of our employment report and placement statistics package. 

Anyway, don't get left behind thinking about your next step. Just jump right into and figure it out along the way.",0,1

I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to ask something like this. I have recently build [a smart power meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/9tjnll/using_an_esp8266_to_read_old_ferraris_energy_meter/) using a small microcontroller. This (apart from showing some data on a homepage) records a timestamp in a database every time 13.3Wh are consumed. By now, I have about 1.5 months worth of data. 

Since I also currently learn about data science at university, I thought I could do a fun project with this data. However, I am lacking ideas what to do with it. So far, I have only classified stuff using decision trees, logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons (using scikit-learn). Since I only have one property here, the timestamps, there is nothing to classify, so I guess I should build something that maybe predicts power usage in the future? Maybe train a neural network that can predict how much power I will use today? 

Can anyone give me a hint on a nice book/tutorial/website for predictions (preferably using scikit since I have already worked with it). Does anyone have any other suggestions on what to do with the data? I can probably provide the data too if anyone else is interested in experimenting with it, although there are probably better data sets around for that.",14,1

So Im pursuing a B.S. in Geography (with a Minor in Intelligence Analysis) and I graduate in two semesters. I also live within the Washington D.C. metro area which is known as a hotspot for jobs within my field.  

I cannot stress this enough when I say that didnt even know Data Science/Data Analysis was a thing until my Junior year of College. I literally thought that the only programming jobs out there were just software engineer/developer jobs. Im just gonna mention my background below and how I got to this current point. 

When I first realized that data science/analysis was a thing, that was when I took a class focusing on Quantitative Methods for Spatial Analysis (i.e. I learned quite a bit about general/spatial statistical methods). Furthermore in that class, I learned how to use R as our assignments were mostly about using R to read a .csv table (which was on traces of cadmium in bodies of water) and thus perform statistical analysis and what I assume was also data visualization). 

My interest in data analytics (excluding GIS analysis) continued when I took a class on web mapping. In that class I learned quite a bit of writing queries in PostGIS (which is an open source software program that adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database). After that was done, I had to make a web application using PostGIS and Javascript/Leaflet. For that class, I had been writing my SQL queries on this website called CartoDB. Once that class was done, I downloaded PostGreSQL on my computer and began understanding how to create/upload relational databases and tables in pgadmin4 (as well as writing all the queries that I remember), which didnt take that long to get. 

I also took a class in Python that same semester, which taught me beyond the generic basics of loops/declaring variables and I feel gave me a strong understanding of that language. I will be also taking another class in R this semester which will be pretty much building on the concepts that I learned from that Quantitative Methods for Spatial Analysis class I mentioned earlier. Ive also used SPSS and GeoDA for statistical analysis on a research project that I was working on for another class I took. 
From my research, Ive come to know/assume two things:

1. Data Analyst positions especially within a large metropolitan area like the one Im living in are very broad and thus I have to take a closer look at the responsibilities/requirements before applying

1. Data Analysts are different from Data Scientists in the sense of the skills/languages that they need to learn, and that Id be far more likely to become a Data Analyst vs. a Data Scientist based on what I have learned alongside my general GIS skills. 

I know quite a bit about data analytics/programming/databases for someone within my academic field, but Im still wondering If Im competitive enough skills-wise for a basic Data Analyst job out of college? If I could magically travel back in time, Id have gotten a Minor in Data Science, but like I mentioned I didnt know data science/analysis existed until my Junior year of college and Ive begun to understand how much it overlaps with my field.

I don't understand why the residual plot looks fundamentally different from the regression plot. As the regression line is almost flat, it is my understanding that the residual plot should look very similar. However it is like the data is turned 45 degree to the right.

I have to present my logistic model created using data mining software to university faculty, many of whom have extensive expertise in regression, using more traditional methods (writing code/manually selecting predictors). I'm afraid they will view data-mining analytics tools as ""inferior"" to other methods of logistic regression, and that I won't know how to answer technical questions since I don't get to spend very much of my workday on modeling. Any tips on what types of questions I can expect, and how to explain the legitimacy of data mining methods? (The software I use to create regression models is similar to SPSS Modeler). Also curious as to your thoughts on the pros and cons of ""traditional"" methods vs. data-mining software methods in general. THANK YOU!  


**Long Version:**

For the last 5 years, I've worked at a University as a data-analyst. A (small-ish) portion of my job consists of creating logistic models of whether students will return or not (e.g., freshman to sophomore retention).  I get to spend *far* less time on this type of work than I'd like to because of other duties, and the only tool we have to do this with is a data-mining tool (I understand  it's similar to SPSS Modeler). Basically after spending a lot of time finessing a large, multi-year dataset, I plug it into this data mining software, which automatically creates the model by mining each field for the most relevant variables. It also automatically checks every transformation of each variable (such as taking the natural log or a cube root) if that is the better predictor.  


We have found it to be very effective and accurate for predicting retention, especially as our data has gotten cleaner over the years. However, **here is my concern:** I've been asked to present my results to a large group of faculty/deans etc, many of whom do predictive modeling using more ""traditional"" methods (e.g., manually selecting variables and building in SPSS, or writing their own code and creating models in R / SAS /  Python / etc. The range of faculty background (social science, business analytics, computer and data science) makes me quite nervous about the questions I might get. *For example, I have only the goodness-of-fit measures that our software spits out, so I won't have some traditional ones for logistic regression to share (such as Hosmer-Lemeshow test - I don't have that one and can't get it with my current software).* The model diagnostics I am provided with are Concordance rate/C-statistic, Cox &amp; Snell Pseudo R-Sq, Somers' D, AIC and BIC, as well as of course the the coef, SE, Wald Chi-Sq, and p-value for each predictor.  


My background is a PhD in a social science field, and I have spent the past 5 years as a data-analyst at this university looking at institutional data (mostly data wrangling/report creation/visualizations). Also, the stats I learned in graduate school were mainly ANOVA's, t-tests, chi-squares, and some regression (but mainly theory and not a lot of practice). I love to work on predictive modeling, but I don't  get to spend too much time on it. Bottom line, I'm worried that I'll get a lot of technical questions from folks who do regression modeling day-in and day-out, and not know how to answer them. Any thoughts you have on the respective merits of traditional vs. data-mining regression techniques would be appreciated, as well as any questions you can anticipate I might get. Thanks!

The course covered topics from ISLR (which i bought and am planning on reading) and other R tutorials for visualization and modeling.

I just wanted to ask how much of DS is able to be self taught and a list of priorities. 

For example, my professor recommended me to learn Linear Algebra which i will be taking an online course on courseva. But idk how i will be able to apply concepts onto a problem. 

Additionally, will any course help me identify which classification models out of a bunch of them that fits the scenario best? For example, logistics regression fits well when the problem is in a yes or no binary response (at least thats what i think) 

I can code models on R by following scriptguides decently. I can visualize decently or at least know how to practice but i dont know which skills i need to fully understand which model to use aside from literally plug and chug any models and compare their F1 scores on a confusion matrix. 

For those that learned DS without a stats or math background, how did you succeed? 

My current plan is to master visualization and ggplot, dpylr like the back of my hand and also to read ISLR but i will be honest my stats and math are on a post highschool level at the moment.",3,1

However, these seem a little bit work-aroundy so I thought I would reach out to the community to crowd source some more suitable ideas. Perhaps others are in a similar situation?

**Some more details**

 \- Basically we have a bunch of initiatives (\~100) that are flagged with a RAG rating 

 \- Each initiative is championed by somebody different within the company and the status will need to be updated monthly with commentary

 \- My manager wants each initiative to be able to be updated with action items with alerts for each action item to be sent out to the relevant people

**What I've looked into**

 \- At the moment they do this via a shared excel document which sits on our document hub

 \- At first I thought that Jira would be a good option but it might be too much for what they are looking for

 \- Other ScrumBoard like tools like Trello seemed to kind of work but also seemed a little bit hacky.  These might do the trick but I'm unsure of any other more fit-for-purpose type tools.

I like this one because small improvements can make have significant financial results and there are many different sensors/inputs available. From payment history to device registration and behavioural biometrics.
2. **phishing detection** \- Where the previous topic aims to block fraudulent transactions, this topic tries to prevent them. For example, the company receives emails with phishing links. Can we recognize it as a phising mail. For example following the link in the mail and determining whether it tries to imitate our company website
3. **Security Operations Center** \- Recognizing ddos attacks and blocking them effectively and this area also involves malware prevention. Can we distinguish usage patterns that are out of the ordinary
4. **Automatic data classifcation** \- based on the text in a document, try to determine the class of the document or assign security attributes to it (e.g. sensitive, contains customer data, etc)
5. **Role assignments** \- Access rights are managed via roles at our company. Here we aim to determine if certain employees have more roles than they should have and initiate the discussion to revoke them

Other things I've seen at our company is predicting big life events that would interest the customer in certain products and predicting workloads to optimize IT infrastructure.",3,1

I know what I should study for the ML part (in fact I also need to study for my DS midterm exam anyway), but for the math part, I don't really know what to study. Here is a list of what I think I should be spot on : 

Gradient Descent, Lagrange Multiplier, MLE, Bayes theorem

Recently I have been working on various text classification problems like Movie review sentiment analysis, Emotion detection system, Quora toxic comment detection etc. After working on all these projects what i came to know is that all the above problems are solved using same Deep learning approach(Keras/tensorflow/pytorch) using Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, CNN. Only the text cleaning process changes based on data. After text cleaning same architecture can be used for all the problems. 

1) Only the Name of the project is changing with fancy names but everything behind the scenes is same architecture with minor changes. I would like to know if this is case with text classification problems where is the scope for further development as every one have already developed state of the art architectures.  Even I also see lot of these different Text classification competitions being hosted on Kaggle. How should the approach change based on the problem?

I am a ""freshly""graduate in actuarial sciences from Switzerland (graduated almost one year ago). 

I am a bit struggling to find an entry position in the actuarial field, so I started thinking what was wrong with me. Apart from the fact that I am a very shy person and the fact that this does not help me selling myself to employers, I find that I lack good knowledge of programming skills in R and VBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning R, I have very few knowledge. We did not have any courses on R during our master program, but we used it on a few courses. So I thought it would be useful to learn R. So, I looked for some tutorials and courses and I am struggling to find some. I did the R Programming course on Coursera, I managed to pass the course ( Even if the last assignment was very difficult, I had to look for some help on Internet).

But then I have no further ressources to continue learning. Where can I find useful ressources to learn R. I looked on the first subject in /r/datascience , but the only book which might be useful is ""R for Data Science"" ([https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) . I thought also subscribing to DataCamp, but the courses look too easy.

So, what are your thoughts on this. And do you have any useful ressources to help me learn programming  in R and also exercise my skills in R .

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning VBA, my programming skills are better. I had a one-semester course on VBA and I did pretty well at the exam. But the question remain the same as for R. How can I extend my knowledge in VBA and where can I exercise my VBA programming skills.

Or I need to show that we reduced 1,000 potential locations to 16 in three filters, so I go to the meaningful columns and pick values that make those steps look meaningful, like 40% pass, 40% pass, 10% pass.

Data Science is all about uncovering findings from data. Diving in at a granular level to mine and understand complex behaviors, trends, and inferences.

Its about surfacing hidden insight that can help enable companies to make smarter business decisions.

* Netflix data mines movie viewing patterns to understand what drives user interest, and uses that to make decisions on which Netflix original series to produce.
* Walmart targets customer unique shopping behavior, which helps to guide messaging to different market audiences.
* E-Commerce Company uses product recommendation engine to end up more purchasing.
* App based Taxi provider analyse previous data to meet up demand and supply of cab in particular area.
* Google Maps uses Data Science to predict best routes.
* Proctor &amp; Gamble utilizes time series models to more clearly understand future demand, which help plan for production levels more optimally.
* Industries are targeting real time analysis to monetize more customer.

Companies have moved towards digital enterprise and real time environment in the past few years. So, Data Science has becoming the most upcoming field in the 21st century and it has millions of job openings.

Data scientists combine statistics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, capturing data in ingenious ways, the ability to look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and aligning the data.",3,1

I have no experience with more advanced NLP algorithms, I've only done some basic parsing so far. Do you have any ideas how to approach this problem?

My first idea was trying to lookup different sentences with a website like Goodreads or something. Still I'd have to know which words are likely to compose a book title (it might be one word, it might 2,3,4 or more).

Second idea was to try the other way around - get book names from Goodreads and try to find them in comments. I'm only concerned that it would take forever to do this lookup.

I am new and inexperienced and I'm basically taking a learn-by-doing approach. Sorry if the post is a little long and the question vague.

My father-in-law is an enamel/car paint distributor who does a fair amount of business. He is really excited that I am interested in analytics and he is eager for me to use his business data and help him out. It will be good for me too, because I can get some professional experience.

 In 2015 he started using pivot tables to find products with small margins and experimented with raising prices on these products. He is also notified when there is a salesperson who has smaller margins than others. This seems way to simple, but he really wasn't using this until 2015 and he tells me most small to medium businesses are still not using these basic techniques to make decisions. Because of this, his business actually grew faster than ever during the worst recession in Brazil in a century. He wants me to help him take it to the next level. However, I don't really know what I am doing and I don't know where to start.

I know a little about some machine learning techniques like SVMs, K-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering, etc. I took a MOOC class on intro to analytics modeling. The problem is, I am having trouble making the connection. My FIL has data on the sales history of each product and each customer. It's all on a program called CH systems, which actually has a built-in BI feature which my FIL doesn't know how to use. When he wants to do things, he uses the CH systems database and filters out whatever subsection he wants to work with, and imports it as an excel spreadsheet. I want to start simple; baby steps. What is something simple I can do for him to start out?

It would be best to do these things in R or Python and make reports with Jupyter notebooks just because of money; hoping to use free packages. I'm taking some online courses in python and analytics for business this coming semester.

What do you all think? It's an awesome opportunity but I'm totally alone and without guidance.

Guys a political liberal, another source of conflict between us, but I digress nonetheless you can guess what position he took on the matter.

I want to take a moment to thank those that messaged me with help on the matter. Just to recap. Weeks later we run into each other at our favorite strip club and things only got worse. He confronted me about my letter I sent to the Datacamp and struck me closed fist cheap shot in the parking lot resulting in a chipped tooth. Now by this time I did not have an unbiased data scientist to help predict the cost of the chipped tooth as he was my most prior data scientist and he relinquished me as a patient via a letter in the mail. Ended up back firing on him as per accordance to the law he still had a duty to crunch some numbers on my molars as insufficient time to find a new DS still exists. He ran some shitty overfitted Lasso regression the next day (in fucking R) and over-billed me. I refused to pay and he sent it to collections and my credit score is adversely affected now along with creditors calling at all hours of the night. I am taking out loans for my weekly Seiko 5 acquisitions and cannot afford for a poor credit score so this is another source of animosity between us. Unfortunately Datacamp took no action (told me they had no clue what I was on about) but with this new found evidence of his assault upon me, CRAN invoked a moral and character clause and blocked his IP from accessing any CRAN mirrors although not to the extent of what I would have liked (shouldve been blocked from Anaconda).

Hello people. I don't want to give too much information so they would recognize me. But with my education background, I'm at best a novice data analyst that can only do descriptive analysis with a clear question.

However, today I went to an interview with a mid-sized  company that does things globally for a DA position. They have 2 people working in ""data"", that is yet. But I'm sure they are very good at what they do. The interview questions really sounded more like a DS position, such as step by step data mining to building tests  and sharing results. Then there is lot of P F Z this and that values that I honestly have no idea is. I answered all their questions with what knowledge I have or heard of and completely bull shit the rest, many of which Im sure is wrong. The responsibility for the position as they described is very exploratory, no one is going to be asking you for anything. You need to figure out how to improve things with the data that the company has. There is going to be a lot of building test cases and finding questions that no one is asking. 

To my surprise, they called and gave me an offer 20 minutes later. I of course am not going to say no to an offer, but I feel way too under-qualified. After signing the written offer and everything, Im even feeling a bit scared. What should I do to not get fired within a month?

**The task is to evaluate credibility of declared income based on the remaining variables and data sample**, agreement with the general statistics - are there some standard approaches for this kind of problem?

My approach ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08040 ) was to:

 1. Normalize the income to uniform distribution on [0,1] using [empirical distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) like in [copula theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_\(probability_theory\)). Thanks of it, modeled density of conditional distribution of this variable seems a proper way to evaluate credibility (?)

 2. Model this density as polynomial and predict its coefficients - currently just using least square linear regression of properties of the remaining variables. 

Are there some better ways to evaluate credibility, model conditional probability from data sample?

I recently got first place in a data science type hackathon, and besides a cash prize I have the opportunity to (freely) attend any conference of choice including flights (I'm from Europe) and hotel.

My background is in aerospace engineering (MSc) and I only recently got into machine learning. I do not have any ML research experience, only really the basics necessary for doing data sciencey stuff. 

I often listen to Talking Machines, and based on that I figured that NIPS and ICML are probably cool places to go. However, I am afraid that since I'm not an ML researcher myself I won't be able to fully appreciate/enjoy it. 

Do you think that for someone with my background (strong mathematically, no ML research experience, only data science experience) it is a wise idea to attend ICML or NIPS in 2019? Or do you have any other suggestions for conferences to attend?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this has been asked before. I'm currently a freshman studying computer science and I've just finished my first semester and performed really well. I aced my programming courses and did well on the math courses. Most people think I'm good (altho I doubt this alot haha). It's just that I've realized that I'm not as interested in studying higher level computer science as I thought I was a few years ago. It's alright and I could finish it with some effort. I've just found it draining. 

By doing some side projects and checking my regular reading list, I realized that I think I have a passion for data science instead. It's not just something I've recently discovered. This is something I've been eyeing for sometime. However, some external pressure influenced my decision and made me try the developer career path. But I realized, I just don't see myself doing that anymore.

I do know computer science is a path to data science but I've been eyeing statistics instead since I figured I can self study the coding side of things. I've found stat really fun in the past. I know it sounds like I've made my decision, but I really haven't. I want to make sure I'm well informed before doing either. I wanted to ask which is better to get me into data science? Should I stick it out with computer science or shift to statistics? Can you share how you got into the field?

Im an undergraduate researcher with a focus in statistics and physics and Im looking for guidance. Recently, Ive reached the point in my research where I can no longer settle to wait hours to let my code run due to the size of the datasets I need to work with (1mil+ rows).

A key example of where Ive run into an issue: say I have 1,000,000+ positional data points ranging V = [a,b]x[c,d]x[e,f], each with 10+ other columns/labels which I use to compute other statistics. First I pre-partition the data into volumes i through n to make the next step quicker. Here I run some statistical tests that can be computationally intensive themselves depending on how spatially dense the data is. In this step I have a routine of like 3-5 functions, each containing nested loops that make this computation ridiculous.

Typically I use pandas to filter my data via basic boolean conditionals but even that takes my computer minutes to run with large data sets. Ive looked into converting everything to numpy arrays but still it takes too long.

I work on a 2018 MacBook pro, I wont bother to list the specs because I know they are insufficient. My brothers gaming PC has a 1070ti GPU and Im looking to parallelize my computations. Id appreciate anyone who can point me int the right direction to resources that will allow me to streamline my code. If not possible with the hardware I have, then provide advice how to develop a competent understanding in order to make a convincing/informed proposal to use my unis super computer.

Just a final note, Ive heard about a package called vaex which claims to be a more efficient pandas. Does anyone have experience with that? Also, Ive used cuda very basically via numba to test out how fast I could speed up matrix multiplication. The barrier to entry for me is knowing what structure/datatypes my code needs to have in order to make the most out of parallelization.

I was hoping someone could provide me some insight into which would be the best to learn first and if there are other languages that would be helpful to learn.

My goal is to land an entry level or junior position as an analyst.

Also if there are any notable resources that would be great for learning I would appreciate that as well. I don't mind spending money on it but ideally I would like any bootcamp type sources to have a shorter time frame if possible, ideally within 8 weeks or less.

Which order should I learn math in for these fields. My major is Industrial engineering and it is suited more for people who want to go into supply chain management or consulting.

I am not willing to switch to a math major because I like the broad amount of fields I can get into with IE and I would like to be employable just in case I don't go to graduate school immediately after I finish undergrad

I am willing to self study the math but don't know what order to go in. IE majors are required to only go up to Multivariable calculus at my school and the other math courses are specifically for industrial engineering so the mathematics is more focused on supply chain management.

I have seen others on reddit and quora mention that it is necessary to learn Diff EQ, Real Analysis and a bunch of other upper level math courses that are not in my school's curriculum.

I would like a list of the math topics I should learn in order after Calculus 1.

No machine learning, artificial intelligence, no neural networks. Let me give you an example. There is a marketing data scientist who worked across the aisle from me. Guess what most of his work duties consisted of? Using a python script to take pictures of Excel data sources and put them into PowerPoint presentations. Also, use SQL server and Query and get data and then create dashboards for it....


Meanwhile, what do I do? I used R and Python alike to create autonomous analytics. Used are to merge datasets together from different places, as well as ETL duties. Extract transform and loading data. I modeled information in tableau and powerbi. I also used python to automate many of my tasks. What's my job title? Business analyst. so I'm just a lowly ba doing the exact same thing as someone who is apparently a data scientist but has never actually used R?

When I was an undergrad, I did internships in finance and spent a lot of time improving data analysis processes - all in Excel and Access.  I continue to enjoy process improvement, data analysis and visualization, and frankly appreciate the money that a career in finance provides.  

One of my friends knew I was looking at a career pivot or change and suggested a General Assembly intro to Data Science.  I really enjoyed that 2-hour workshop and immediately signed up for the Data Science path on Dataquest.  I've made it through the Beginner Python course and am continuing on to Intermediate.

They also gave me a sort of hint that drought levels are impacted by water levels in that region and the level of vegetation/greenery. So you had to think of data inouts that would directly imoact these two things. My first guess was to gather satellite data and identify which areas were more greener to determine vegetation level. They wanted more.

  


They said you were open to collect any kind of data from the government to solve this problem but the data would be at district level and not village level. Also it would have a 2-3 year time lag. So, finding the economies of all villages is not an option because we'll the data at the state level and we have to estimate drought magnitudes at the village level.

Each record has a subject field that ideally describes what kind of issue it is.

Some of the subject fields are formatted as such:

Ticket # - Description of Problem - Location(City/State)

To parse these subject fields, I would split by '-' and take the first index, this is how i arrived at 1500 unique values.

I then noticed that there were categories that were the same such as ""ACCOUNT_POLICY"" and ""Account Policy"".

To get around this, I made everything lowercase and removed all non-alphanumeric characters.

The number was then reduced to 1450. 

I want to move forward for my analysis because I feel like this is good enough (although I'm probably wrong because I'm very new).

There are also edge cases that could mean the same thing such as ""Renew Policy"" and ""Policy Renewal"". 

People also do not always follow the above hyphen delimited format, which makes it more difficult to assign each record a category based off the subject line.

Based off the processed data I have so far, I can at least see during what time period these production issues were frequent and then try digging into those.

I was struggling on my decision so I thought I could seek for advice here.

I'm an international student from Northeast Asia, currently attending high school in the US as a senior.

This year, I applied for 5 colleges(Fairfield University, Saint Louis University, Villanova University, Texas Christian University, University of Cincinnati). 

* Got accepted from : Fairfield, Saint Louis, Texas Christian - Received grant &amp; scholarship from all
* Waiting on: Villanova, Cincinnati

Villanova is my top choice &amp; most likely to go there if I get accepted, but realistically I don't think I'll get in(Deferred in Early Decision round).

With aid, the cost is roughly around $29k/yr for all and my parents can afford it.

1. TCU Pros &amp; Cons 
   1. Pro) Biggest CS program(100+ per class)
   2. Pro) Near DFW(good environment)
   3. Pro) Cheap Cost of living &amp; Tax
   4. Pro) Offers Data Science minor
   5. Con) Does not offer 5 year BS/MS program
2. Saint Louis Pros &amp; Cons
   1. Pro) Good faculty 
   2. Pro) 5 year BS/MS program(Computer Science/Software Engineering)
   3. Pro) High graduate salary
   4. Pro) Great location(Saint Louis)
   5. Pro) Most concentration on Data Science
   6. Con) Small CS program(25 per class)
3. Fairfield Pros &amp; Cons
   1. Pro) I love New England region
   2. Pro) Beautiful Campus &amp; 1 hour from NYC
   3. Pro) 5 year BS/MS program(Computer Science/Software Engineering)
   4. Con) Smallest CS program(5\~10 per class)
   5. Con) Too concentrated on Nursing &amp; Business program

&amp;#x200B;

1. I know it's highly recommended for students in this field to pursue at least a MS degree, and I'm planning to do the fast track program of my college to get the MS after 5 years. My question is that should I now focus on getting an internship, or doing research? IIRC, the general consensus is that research == academia, and internship == industry, but the line is pretty blurry here as I'm definitely going to do grad school, which means I'll do research anyways and getting an internship might help me more? Please correct me if I'm wrong.  

2. How well would a MS in CS fare against other degrees (for example, a MS in stats) in the DS industry? Is a CS Masters much more well rounded and also allows me to switch to other career paths (i.e SWE)? Should I just try to get a MS in CS but also take some stats electives?

[Medium Post](http://bit.ly/2AhbuYS)

As aspiring data scientists or data scientists new to the field (and working in a business-centric rather than a research-centric role), it is easy to be blinded by the technical aspects of data science such as exploratory data analysis and machine learning, failing to see the forest for the trees.

My goal with this post and accompanying GitHub project is to provide a more accurate example of an enterprise-grade data science project that includes what is often missed in these sorts of examples: **the rigorous positioning of a business problem and scoping of a data science solution**.

The majority of the time spent to complete this project was allocated to the understanding and definition of the business problem rather than optimizing a machine learning model. As with any other complex problem, spending some time upfront to work through the various aspects of a business problem in a systematic way will reduce the risk of coming up with the wrong solution, which clearly wastes time (read: opportunity loss) and money.",0,1

I wanted to build out my probability skills, too. I took the MITx course Probability 6.431x and read some of the Introduction to Probability textbook by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis.

I'm doing some practice exercises and then I'm going to start building up my portfolio. I'm curious to get a sense of how much of your work relies on being effective with probability problems.

Namely, it seems like the problems I see on Kaggle have a lot to do with exploring data, organizing and cleaning data and then building models around predicting data. 

There aren't many cases where the parameters are known and the competition has to do with calculating probability of future events.

How much do you use probability on your day-to-day? Are you pulling out your cumulative distribution functions or Markov chains?

What are some things I should be looking into.

Let me elaborate.

I've got a dataset of tens of thousands of observations. Each observation is made up of between 15 to 30 different events that are each measured on approximately 10 different metrics. There are hundreds of different types of events, but they are all measured the same. I have a lot of prior knowledge about each event but very little about their relationships. These events are highly interrelated, but not in completely obvious ways. I need to be able to give data describing my prior knowledge of these events and the metrics I should expect from each of them and then get a few hundred simulations of their possible actual values. 

I was thinking of using a variational autoencoder, encoding information about the priors, adding noise to the factors and then decoding the factors. I also thought that I could use a gan, but felt that was overkill. This seems like the type of thing I could use an mcmc algorithm for, but I can't find much on how to figure out how to sample from an unknown distribution and how to figure out once I've sampled from it whether it was a likely or unlikely when comparing it to the data.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

- I want to put it somewhere semi-public so others in my org can access and change the scripts if necessary
- I want to make the sync process as robust as possible. Right now, if anything goes wrong I need to open my scripts and adjust them, but I feel like there must be a service out there that is made for matching fields in one database to those in another.

- I want the sync to be ideally real-time (something changes in the source db should kick off a sync to the target db) or at least schedulable to run multiple times a day.

It makes sense that not much variation is present in the first few years of its introduction. Like the entire 2015,2016 data is basically the same numbers. I'm working on a model to predict/analyse the behavior of this price variation using the volume of the coin. (How many coins are in circulation at any point in time).

The data was gathered from CoinMarketCap. It was daily, and I changed it into weekly data. I also completely got rid of the 2015 and 2016 rows! It went from a 1200ish rows of data to about 170 rows. Am I just completely wrong in doing this? I feel like the first few years don't add much to my data, and I want to escape the effect of the previous day's price on today's price; which is why I turned my data into weekly increments. 

I've also done these, which I'm unsure about:

1. CMC shares High, Low, Opening and Closing prices. I combined (averaged) these columns into just one column and called the new one ""Price"". Why is this bad practice? (If it is)

2. When changing my data from daily to weekly, I averaged the price. (the average of 7 prices for each day is the price for that week.) But with volume, I think this is wrong. See, volume is how many coins are in circulation in a day. At first I thought the number must go up all the time, but that's not necessarily true. (What I mean is that it is not added to the previous day). I ended up using the Maximum of the 7 days to represent the volume for the week, because I wanted something that covered all the possible values in a week. The average wouldn't have done this. Am I wrong? 

Here's an overall graph of how it looked when the 2015-2016 data was included:

I  have always been interested in academia but have been having second thoughts lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though my degree will say mechanical engineer, I work on applications of dynamical systems to data science problems in chemistry and medicine. With this I have a lot of experience coding in MATLAB. I understand that to get into the data science field I may have a lot to learn and maybe an internship to do before I could enter into the job market.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to find people that have been in a similar situation. My questions:

Are you happy you left academia?

Are you fulfilled with your data science job?

Is it easy to find a job where you want as long as it is a tech city? I am considering limiting my search to Raleigh-Durham North Carolina for a girl.",7,1

While the topic of AI is in the forefront of the media, most (especially the executive floor) are still not clear on how to best use machine learning or what it takes to implement it all.

Ultimately, machine learning can be described as a synergistic relationship between man and machine. Machine learning in practice requires the application of the scientific method and communication skills by humans. Successful companies have the analytical infrastructure, know-how and close collaboration between analysts and business professionals to translate these synergies into ROI.

Is your business ready for the use of artificial intelligence?

Here are some key aspects your company should fulfill to implement successful methods based on Artificial Intelligence.
