Let's say your data set has a whole lot of people's details on taste preference and favourite beer, and you want to predict new people's favourite beer based on their taste preference.

So the data is something like:

|Person_ID | Taste_Pref | Fav_Beer |
|:----|:----|:----|
|001 | Sour | Becks |
|002 | Sweet | Corona |

And so on, with say 3 different taste preferences (sweet, sour, bitter) and say 5 different beers (Becks, Bud, Corona, Coors, Miller).

From what I understand, a frequentist approach basically gives a percentage of the count of the number of people with X taste preference who have Y favourite beer, out of the total number of people with X taste preference. So if there are 10 people with sour taste preference and 5 of them like Becks, then the probability of liking Becks when you have a sour taste preference is 50%.

1. What would the bayesian approach be?

2. How does this change with additional feature variables (e.g. favourite food, or some other thing which might indicate beer preference)?",2,8

Medical claim amount totals per person (for year t)
Health survey questionnaire data (from year t-1) which contains around 150 fields, each with a different health-related question such as inquiring about the persons eating habits, exercise routines, if theyve smoked within the last 6 months, etc.
 
Im trying to build a model that uses the questionnaire information to predict claims costs, more than likely by using decision-trees and clustering algos. However, I first took a glance at the data by making a composite scoring of the survey that assigns a score between 1-100 to each person, but this had little correlation with the claims costs. I then picked out a few of the questions that I knew would be significant, such as have you ever been diagnosed with Diabetes? and the correlation with claims costs became apparent.
 
Now that Im sure that some of the questions hold different weights, how can I create a model that will find the most significant questions to predict costs?

****

**Experiment Results**:
A great amount of good career posts and questions.  A few people ignored the post and posted their questions as their own separate posts, though it seemed to decline over the last month. Lots of great participation from everybody and for 99% of the time, everyone was fair, patient, positive, and helpful.

****

**Proposal**

* Create a new username that only posts the career thread (which makes it easy to look at it's history)
* Post a new stickied career thread every week
* Add historical threads to the Wiki

****

**For Discussion**

* Keep or kill the weekly ""stickied data science career thread""
* If keep, what is the best day to post it (currently Friday, but it can be any one)
* Things you think would improve it
* Things you think detracted from it


****

Over the next week, please post your thoughts / questions / answers / suggestions here and we'll go from there.

* What is the fine line of a programmer aiding operations of a business by developing       systems to improve efficiency?

* Is Data Science more about taking a Scientific Researcher mentality to numbers/data and  organizing it in such a way it is easier to assess and analyze?

* If I take publicly available data and develop an algorithm and plot this data in a meaningful way.. Where is the line between being a Statistician and being a Data Scientist... or what about being just a Data Analyst?

I started working on my family business, and our warehouse is full of overbought items. Before I write here, I searched for right information, and formulas in the internet for many hours. But couldn't find anything practical. So, I am here for asking your help about a simple formula.

I need two things: 

First one is; I have a dataset of more than 10.000 different inventory items. In the data, each item has available amount in the warehouse; sale amounts in 2014, 2015, and 2016; purchase amounts in 2014, 2015, and 2016. I tried to create a simple formula like 

(Available Stock for X - Total Sales of X in 2016)/Total Sales of X in 2015. 

In the formula, when I subtract available stock of x from total sales of x, I tried to determine the remaining sales (we buy inventories for 1 year). When remaining sales are dived to total sales, the number should close to 1. If it is larger than 1, it means we have more than we need of that item. I tried to calculate the overbought items, but this formula is really weak. Can anything better done?

The second I need is simple, practical educational material. I examined the free data available in this subreddit, however it was too complicated for me. 

If you need more data, just ask. Thank you for your help. 

PS: I have a silly problem that I can't express my thoughts clearly. When I talk, or write I assume everyone is understanding me, but sometimes they can't follow up. So, if anything is not clear, tell me, and I will try to fix it.",5,3
70,2016-5-7,2016,5,7,5,4i719m,Acceptable Quality of App-Generated Data?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4i719m/acceptable_quality_of_appgenerated_data/,ArtQuixotic,1462567603,"I'm relatively new to software data - my (12 years) experience is in program evaluation and policy-related stuff. I could use some perspective from you all (in my first Reddit post ever). The data I've worked with in the past have been my own (survey data and the like), generated by my own employees (so I have control of the quality), or are large collections of government data that follow criteria clearly established in data manuals.

In this new role as the first data scientist at a small app-development startup, I'm trying to work with data generated by an app created by five developers. One front-end JS/HTML developer in particular has the app producing extraordinarily dirty data. I created a basic data manual that everyone understands and agrees to follow, but this developer's data do not meet the criteria. He admits this is the case, but says that I need to understand the nuances of the app in order to understand the context of the resulting analytics.

An example of his resistance to consistently log labels of components clicked in the app: ""Any object is inherently abstract, and given definition by the developer. So when you click on a graph, you're actually clicking on a '&lt;div&gt;' element. But the logo is also inside a '&lt;div&gt;'. And when you click on the logo, the browser may decide you clicked exactly on the logo, so you'll get '&lt;svg&gt;', or it may decide you clicked on the containing '&lt;div&gt;', or the'&lt;nav&gt;', or even the '&lt;body&gt;', which we've seen in our current logs. So we need some serious creative thinking... I read somewhere of someone extending '.addEventListener' to capture logs. That could be a good way of automating them.""

The data are available to me in a CSV for now. The relevant records contain values that are switched around in order, inclusions of bits of raw code or seemingly random gibberish with values, missing or extra commas (which change the length of records), etc. It's unreadable, really, and I got through the last stage of development and testing with many hours of brute-force manipulating the data in text editors, etc. This was only a temporary solution and would be unacceptable in the long term. Given the choice, I'd rather be using the time to add value elsewhere instead trying to learn about front-end programming.

Because I'm new to this sort of data, I don't know where one role traditionally starts and another ends. Should I be trying to learn what he says I'm lacking? Is there more space in there between a clean analytics file and the app's raw code? Would it be reasonable for me to expect a file that I can actually extract and clean?

To complicate matters, we have a flat organization structure, so there is no ""boss"" that I can turn to for help. There is a back-end developer who understands both sides of the situation (I do not), but he's hesitant to get involved. So I really appreciate any perspective you can add.",1,1
71,2016-5-7,2016,5,7,6,4i7766,How to store and analyze compatibility and inventory data sets?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4i7766/how_to_store_and_analyze_compatibility_and/,devilized,1462569885,"So, I'm pretty new to the idea of 'data science' and 'big data'. Until now, everything I've needed to do has fit well inside a SQL-type data format. Now, I'm trying to tackle a problem using mass amounts of hardware/software compatibility data. 

Basically, multiple vendors release data, typically called a ""compatibility matrix"", on what combinations of hardware, software, firmware, operating systems, drivers, etc are compatible with each other. In an organization that deals with multiple vendors across all facets, it's difficult to identify a method of analysis where I can load this compatibility data, load our inventory, and find the problems on a large scale. Small scale, I loaded those into two SQL tables. One table with every combination of supported configurations, the other with every system we have and all its attributes, and ran a comparison. This works, but doesn't scale. 

What might be alternative technologies I should look into for storing this type of data, and analyzing these two datasets against each other?

Now, it sort of works fine. However, I need to now bring the product's price into the equation. I'm trying to gather average monthly price of the item for the past, and now I have to use sales history and price to come up with the forecast given a price in the future.

I have no idea how to do that, as this model only has level, trend and seasonality, which I would need as well.

By the way, the same author also has a piece on using a ratio of my price versus the competitors price, but I dont have access to historical competitor's pricing here.

Is there a way you guys can help to get to a solution? Unfortunately,  I can use only Excel for the time being although I know you guys like R or other such languages.

There are millions of events and several dozen features. The features are mostly numerical (a few are categorical and I plan to one-hot encode them). One of the features is time, and I think there is a time trend.

I know the events are not perfectly independent, but I think it's too hard to model that, so as a first approximation, I'm comfortable assuming that events are generated by Poisson process with the intensity that depends on the features. I want to predict the intensity given feature values.

I expect that the true relationship between the features and the intensity is relatively smooth but quite complicated (certainly non-linear and non-monotonic). I also expect that the intensity is never negligible (that is, for any feature values, the events might still happen once in a while).

What machine learning or statistical models should I consider?

I assume kernel density estimation and other local techniques are hopeless because there are too many dimensions.

I thought Gaussian Mixed Models might help, but I haven't seen any papers or links that describe their use in a similar situation (I'm concerned that the ""thin tails"" of gaussian distributions would not do well given that in my data the intensity never gets too close to zero).

I'm moving this question from crossvalidated to here because I guess this subreddit is a better fit for this topic.",6,4

My projects are often: *understand the relations between a certain behavior and something else in business quantitatively*.

So the non-IT writes some MS world document with an overview, I have to set up a Dropbox folder that in two days is completely messy with a mix of data that we find, ipython notebooks and other partial reports that we needs to share with links etc. (e.g. a file for each subject we have to study), mostly we interact with hangout or in the lucky days with slack. 

I believe that the bottle neck is world files, and everything would be cleaner if we had a wiki-like interface where to write everything about the project with links and graphs and reports.

""The machine learning method we use is very simple. For each feature a threshold value is calculated separating the training examples into two groups. The threshold is selected so as to make the mean entropy of these as low as possible.To classify a new example, which group it belongs to is checked for each feature, and the proportion between positive and negative examples in this group used. The proportion of positive examples for each group the example belongs to is multiplied together and compared to the product in the same way for the negative examples. If the product for the positive examples is larger the example is classified as a joke, otherwise as a non-joke. This method is not very powerful, but fast.""

I'm 28 years old. I've spent 7 years working at an engineering firm, the last 4 of which have been working with database administrators to work with ""larger"" datasets. 


I'm *damn* good with excel and access. Very good with understanding Entity relationship Diagrams etc. The databases I work with, the front ends are too rigid and the backends are located at labs accross the country so I generally have the administrators pull custom SQL queries for me in the neighborhood of 10-30 mbs at a time. I then manipulate them with nested ifs, countifs, product sums, and vlookups to extract useful information for clients. When I give the client questions directly to the database guys, they often come back with ""we don't know how to do that"" so that's my value added (figuring out the logic"". 

It's been slow for me to acquire direct SQL expertise because I don't have direct access to the servers like they do. 

My question, can I call myself a datascientist if I can't write R, python, SQL? (I can read Python and SQL somewhat) Is their a different name for technical people that work with or manage data scientist?

For context I'm interested in figuring out what skills I should focus on for my development plan.

I've been here a year and my plan is to use this job as my playground to learn and experiment. When I first started, everyone was just using Excel and doing everything really manually, like joining data sets using vlookup, remove duplicates, and then sumifs (uh yeah, you can imagine how long this took).

Thanks to coursera and online tutorials (classes are expensed by the company which makes this even sweeter), I self taught myself SQL and began implementing and using RDMBS. I first used Access and then am slowly learning and using SQL Server 2014 (free version). It's definitely saved me a lot of time on reporting and my boss has praised me for being innovative and proactive.

I'm currently taking a class on data visualization and communication with Tableau on coursera. Once I'm finished with that, I'm planning on taking courses on stats and R, specifically this: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics

I'm also learning some of the data back end stuff, in part because I have to. This entails like setting up SQL Server, developing an ETL process, etc. Do you think this is something I should focus on? I should note that the only reason I feel I need to learn this is because my current job doesn't have any engineering resources on my team to implement it for me.

for me:

bnlearn - belief networks

np - nonparametric regression (slow as hell)

gam - generalized additive models 

Hmisc - exploratory data analysis

rms - my main tool for modeling. harrell fanboy here.


As you can probably tell, I have a more 'traditional' statistician job than most of you...though my job title is 'data scientist', which I don't like, but that's a different story

I started an internship with a company as a data analyst on Monday (exciting!). With that, I've mostly only dealt with things like excel sheets and CSV's when it comes to data and have never had to really think much as to the retreival/storage of the data, especially on a company level. I've been assigned a task to generate a business case for a full time analytics/architect position, but don't know a thing about architecture.

While this is of course requires a company-specific addressing in terms of their current internal structuring, I was wondering if anyone could give me a rundown of what a data architect does? Almost everything I have found online is fairly ambiguous and buzzwordy, with little actual substance. That being said, I'm sure it's not a simple answer, but I just want a basic understanding.

I really just want to know if they are more generally more focused on hardware (servers?) or software implementation, or if they are mostly concerned about how data sets are interconnected and updated, or all of the above? Am I even asking the right questions?

The methodology: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm

The code used to analyze the data: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/blob/master/Compas%20Analysis.ipynb


**Here is what their data actually shows [see section 54-63 of their code]:**

**Of the 3696 black defendants in the data:**

* 2174 (59%) were classified as high risk

* 532 + 1369 (51%) re-offended within 730 days

* Of the blacks classified as high risk, 56% re-offended within 730 days

* for violent crimes, of the blacks classified as high risk, 21% re-offended within 730 days

**Of the 2454 white defendants in the data:**

* 349 + 505 (35%) were classified as high risk

* 461 + 505 (39%) re-offended within 730 days

* Of the whites classified as high risk, 59% re-offended within 730 days

* for violent crimes, of the whites classified as high risk, 17% re-offended within 730 days

Looking at their analysis, I would say that:

* black defendants are classified as high risk more often because the recidivism rate of black defendants is significantly higher.

* a lot of the numbers presented in the article is biased, in particular the table titled ""Prediction Fails Differently for Black Defendants"" which implies recidivism rate for whites is higher than blacks.

Articles like this destroys the credibility of the entire data analyst community.",90,22

It'd be nice to have something like Lyst's calculator, but explained in a way that business users would understand. For example, I'd let people set the prior mean and variance and calculate the alpha and beta priors from that. It'd also be good to include advice on when to stop the experiment, which obviously depends on the user's risk appetite.

A related issue is dealing with experimental settings where we're not optimising for a binary target (e.g., we're trying to increase revenue) and where different interventions have different costs. That's different from the common web-based A/B scenarios, and I know how to model such scenarios, but my problem is empowering business users to do the analysis themselves.

In regards to programming, I've tried it many times, but for some reason it just doesn't seem to be as intuitive to me as other quantitative classes (Stats, Calc, etc...). I also find programming to be especially TEDIOUS.

I began researching the Data Analytics field as it seemed to fit with most of my interests and strengths. My understanding from research was that Data Analysts seem to utilize a lower level skill set of statistical analysis and programming. They seem to primarily analyze past data and give companies an insight as to their current position. They also do very slight predictive analysis. Data Scientists on the other hand seem to work with Big Data and focus heavily on the predictive piece utilizing advanced statistical and programming techniques. Please correct me if any of this seems inaccurate.

The issue is now in terms of my capability as well as what I am willing to do. I believe that programming will always be tedious and difficult for me and therefore I am not sure that being a Data Scientist will be right for me. On the other hand, I love Math, especially Statistics and am really interested in quantitative, analytical work.

My questions are ,

1: Is R the right place to start ?  
2: If I practice and dedicate enough time and scale up on R as a novice can I expect to get a job or freelancing work.   
3: How much can I expect to earn as a novice R programmer.  


I only have degree in Computer Science and plan to take few internet certification course on statistics would that be enough
