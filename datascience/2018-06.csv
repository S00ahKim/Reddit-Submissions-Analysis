I'm doing a work project where the client requested some clustering -- but the data is largely categorical and some very helpful binary data.  

FWIW -- only around 40k rows... potentially 400+ variables but I think only about 20-30 are meaningful.  The levels of the categorical variables could vary from 2 to 400, so it varies widely.  There are SOME variables that are widely numeric but definitely a minority.

KMeans won't work because I can't justify converting the categorical data to a numeric scale and even the binary data doesn't 'separate' the observations enough, so I don't think that would work.

Random forest won't work because I don't have an actual classification outcome.

I keep reading that KModes might be the way to go... which is apparently like KMeans but is purposed for categorical data.  Never tried KModes though because I usually found a workaround.

I was thinking of trying a hierarchical cluster algorithm, but I haven't really done them before but I think that's what I need.

I've done deep learning in practice for fun but never professionally -- but if someone here thinks DL is the way to go here let me know (and the preferred algo) and I'll chug along.

Im glad to be here....

I have written a paper on a new type of network for NLP but i have lingering questions on how efficient and effective it is....this is a link to it on my blog...

ABSTRACT submited

So the following is a more formal framing of efficiency and effectiveness in this network that i would appreciate input on.

i have a type of network...it has one output node connected to all 4 hidden layer nodes, which are connected to the 12 input layer nodes the following way.Each is connected to exactly 9 nodes and the set of all sets of 3 nodes not being used by each node in the hidden layer consist of disjoint sets....this just means that we cant have any 2 nodes connected to the exact same nine nodes...or in general , we cant have any two nodes share missing nodes between them......
if this is clear so far there is another condition....the inputs of these input nodes is a number and each node in the hidden layer simply sums all the numbers from the input nodes it is connected to....

*This is not a neural network*...all a node in one layer does is collect a number from the nodes it is connected to , sums them and then passes them on to the next layer...no bias , no weights and no activation function...its really simple (for now)lol....now we could input random numbers into the input layer and compute a value at the end....so just imagine if we had an expected output number for a particular input of numbers and were to use this to calculate some form of loss...but we dont realy have variables to adjust....

so we will say the variables we want to adjust ARE the input numbers and we want to adjust in the direction that qulaifies the out put for a certain forward pass according to some criteria that determines what we expect....so say we expect the number 10...and we get 5 with a random input of numbers then we adjust the variables (numbers) by back propagation with GD till they produce the number 10 at the output...

.....my first question is , is this a convex optimisation problem and how can we tell that the global minimum error is zero?
Another question is , if we use a complex expression to calculate the value of a node , like for each node in the hidden layer receiving an input from 9 nodes we scale the number by multiplying it with the value of the three nodes left out of the 12.
so then it becomes a fully connected layer and in some connections the value of the connected node (3 of them for each node in the hidden layer )multiplies instead of adds to the value that the other nodes have...will it still be a convex function.....

note that there is an interplay of features at play , each number in the input contributes to the output by being added in some nodes and multiplying the value of others.....

if you have come this far ...could we have it that one of the three numbers is cubed , the other squred and last left alone of the three before multiplying.....
would it still be convex..or get even more convoluted? 
how can we generalise the results of what changes to the system takes us further from a convex loss function than others......
Ultimately

======
is there gauranteed one shared function, for each node in the hidden layers computation, that will give us a convex loss function. And what would be the general form of such.
=====

Part two of this
===

We connect 100 parralel networks of this type we will not attach their output nodes to another.We will have 100 output nodes. We also do not merge the hidden layer units of the 100 but we are choosing to keep a note of which nodes belonged to the hidden layer of each of the 100 networks.Also Each of those 100 have a number of nodes in their hidden layer between 1 and 10.

We need to keep this note in memory because we will delete ALL the input neurons and set it up again as follows , So these 100 networks are connected only because they are connected to samples of the input layer nodes, with each sample set intersecting with many others.
To clarrify:
We select a random selection of 20 nodes across the hidden layers partitions of ALL 100 networks and label them ""A"" then we omit them from the next procedure which is to perform this process again with the remaining nodes, and label them ""B""....then we omit all A's and B's from the next procedure and repeat the process till we have none left to label.

Now we will connect each ""A,B,C..."" nodes to the input layer in the following way

Remember at first we remove all the input layer nodes, and populate the input layer as follows
======
create 3 nodes and place them in the input layer

connect ALL ""A""'s to those 3 nodes.....(these will be the 3 nodes we will use to modify the sum from the other by multiplying instead of adding).

create ANOTHER 3 nodes and place them in the input layer

Connect ALL ""B""'s to those three nodes

repeat for all A ,B,C....

=======

Then:
Take each of the hidden nodes from each of the 100 networks we joined together.
Remember we still remember which hidden layer nodes came from which of the 100 networks.
So we take all nodes say of type B and connect them to the input nodes of the remaining nodes in the rest of the particular set of nodes that they came with in a particular network of the hundred .

E.g. if network 2 has nodes labelled "" F,O,B,S"" and network 35 has nodes labeled ""P,B,E,C,B,G"". then we connect both nodes labeled B and connect them to the input layer nodes of all the remaing nodes, i.e. ""F,O,S,P,E,C,G""

If B was also in network ,15 ..which is ""Y,B"" ...then we include Y in the list of remaining nodes.

We do this for All A,B,C....nodes. Note B's are not in the list of all remaining nodes by definition so there is no connecting all B's in each network together.

======


We have now completed the network. :)
=============
*pat on back*

so if we randomly assign an expected value of either 0 or 1 to each of the 100 output nodes then we backpropagate accross each separately their loss..

This would be the equivalent of classifying each of 100 sentences as either spam or not spam...Of course there is no pattern in how the A,B,C.... are distributed, but if this still works , then it means each word A,B,C... will have a range of nuances that are being captured in this system, and for this example we are installing into the system the definition of spam and non spam...i.e we are forcing the words to follow a pattern. if we get a nother random sample of words, and classify them as say spam , then they will be fitting this definition...of course really the definition is NOT spam and non spam , but 0 and 1 ness. Meaning that we could choose to deliberately use a system with real words set up like this and arrange for the spam examples to have an expected output of 0 and the non spam ones to be 1.

The system upon convergence , with enogh examples will have captured the relationships between words that belong to a spam sentence by adjusting the input layers variables.

If we store those variables we can use them on a random sentence to see if its spam or not. 

Now for the ultimate questions...(why i put you through this)

Does this network pass all the requirements for convexity and a global minimum with a value of zero?

For any expected value 

And what type of computation involving the 3 nodes connected to each A,B.. and their complement should we use to ensure we do infact pas these two requirements.",3,0

This is my first post, so I apologize if I do something wrong. Warning you in advance this will be kinda long.

I am a student majoring in data analytics at Washington state university. This major is pretty new, and I will most likely be part of the first graduating class.

My goal is to get a data analyst job do a masters and then eventually become a data scientist.

Recently I've been feeling pretty discouraged. I worked as hard as I could in high school and was accepted into the UIUC computer science program. However, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't do well, and after my sophomore year my GPA dipped below 3 to around 2.8.

Afterwards I switched to this program at WSU, and have been enrolled for one year. I am enjoying the classes much more than at Illinois, and overall like the field a lot. We mainly do Python, R, SQL and statistics. Even though I usually take 6 classes, my GPA has also improved here and I now have a 3.77 and am considered to be part of the honor role.

After doing this I was really hoping I would be able to get an internship as a data analyst, scientist, engineer, or business analyst. After 200+ applications, I got no offers and pretty much no interviews. 

I am afraid that after I graduate in 2019, I will be unable to find a job. It seems that everyone is looking for people with many internships and several years of experience, which I do not have. My school is not that well known and my degree is pretty much completely unknown as well. Despite not having an internship, I haven't given up and spend most of my day doing data science related classes (like the data science track in data camp). But still I feel anxious, all of my friends have had internships and I constantly think that I am falling further and further behind. I know I shouldn't think this, but its hard not too when half my friends have top 4 internships.

I was planning on doing a data science springboard bootcamp as they have a money back guarantee for a job or doing a masters in either statistics, data science or computer science straight out of college.

I was just wondering how bad you guys think my situation is, and what steps I should take to improve. 

I apologize for the soap box rant, its just that today I felt especially afraid and was wondering if there was anyone who has been in a similar situation or has any advice.

Any advice is truly appreciated. Please let me know if you need any more information.

I never turn these in and they are mainly meant to practice, but I'm tired of always having to look at peoples ""solutions"" and methods instead of coming up with my own novel way from scratch or doing all the steps on my own.

I'm not sure what I am trying to say, but I just want to be able to do my own analysis without having to copy others or look at others work. I feel terrible since I'm stealing other peoples books, adding/changing a bit, and then combining things to make my notebook. I want to do the whole process on my own like everyone else.

I've never copy pasted code, but still by just typing up or modifying/building from others I feel inadequate. Whenever I try to build my own project I feel lost or that my work won't be as good. Though my coding ability has increased, I want it to be higher. However, starting from today, I have made a pledge to never look at peoples solutions.

I was just wondering if you guys had any tips to improving on python coding. I just feel that I end up either copying based on memory, or copying directly.

Sorry for the rambling, I've just been frustrated over how inadequate my skills are.

3.can i put simple projects in my resume too, like titanic, iris or weedles cave dataset?
4.When improving accuracy, for example take a machine learning classifier like Deciosn Tree, how do i improve its accuracy? There are lots of parameters to play around with and I can't just keep using any parameter and hope for the best. Is feature engineering my hope in this case

I've been focusing most of my effort on improving data integrity and our data architecture while also managing our reports. My intention is to get our data and our reports into good shape and then start doing research on our data. We have over 10 years of calls data in addition to 10+ years of data from a few other programs, but that data is much less consistent than the calls data. I'm excited to get to that point, although it is a long slog because the data and reports were in really bad shape when I started here.


I'd like to learn more about sub-fields within data so I can start thinking about where I want to go in the next year or so, once I feel like I've accomplished my goals at my current work place.


I am very invested in data integrity and architecture and it seems like something that is often ignored in pursuit of reporting and data science. I also really like answering questions with data science (or more likely, finding more questions to ask!)


I feel like to advance in any of the specialties I'll need to beef up my resume beyond work experience. I am the only person working on these projects and the only person doing this type of work at my company, so I am teaching myself everything I need to know and I know that, if I want to move into a more advanced position or a more data-focused company, I'll need to be aware of industry standards/tools.


I have a masters in public policy and focused my elective on statistics/data management. I know R and STATA pretty well, although I'm sure there is a lot more I could learn in R. I have a little bit of knowledge of SQL, but I haven't had a chance to really use that in a workplace setting.


Aside from Data Architecture and Data Science, what sub-fields exist? Do you know of any good resources to learn about industry standards for different sub-fields?",6,8

They also at the end give you career counseling and help you find a job.

Ive been trying to play around with various Kaggle competitions and datasets.  

Specifically, Ive been trying my hand at some computer vision projects, like image classification and image segmentation. Im trying to come up with my own algorithms and models based on what Ive learned in various online courses \(Udemy, Udacity, Stanford CS231n, etc.\). I know Keras and Tensorflow, so I know how to build my own model from scratch. However, it seems like my models never really perform well. Im kind of fumbling in the dark here.  

One thing Ive noticed is that a lot of people will either \(a\) use a pre\-trained network in Keras, like VGG19 or ResNet50, or \(b\) theyll implement a model described in an academic paper. Now, if I want to get better at computer vision and build projects that will make my resume look good, is this a viable approach? Because, on the one hand, it just seems like Im copying or using someone elses work, which seems like cheating and a bad way to learn on my own. However, on the other hand, it seems like a good way to build a reliable, high\-performing model.  

What do most people do? For the record, Im not a researcher in computer vision or machine learning. My BS and MS were both in Electrical Engineering, everything I know about computer science is largely self\-taught, and the only formal education I have in data science or machine learning is a three\-month boot camp I did in late 2016. I definitely am not as well\-versed in CV or ML as an actual university researcher who would write such papers or develop such models.  

So, as someone who wants to get better at machine learning and data science, is using pre\-trained networks and implementing models described in academic papers a good way to build up my resume and to improve my skills? Do people start out doing that and then ultimately start developing their own models based off of what theyve learned?  ",1,1

So if I try two hyperparameter combinations, for example:

combo    metric\_valid    metric\_test

2            0.95           0.93

It looks like, to me, that I would choose model 2, because less of a difference in the performance of the model on the validation and test sets, whereas model 1 doesn't do as well on validation but does better than model 2 on test. Choose model 2 even though its overall test score is lower, because otherwise it seems like there's no point in even having a validation set if I'm just going to select the model with the highest test score, irrespective of its validation score.",18,6

I made a batch script so it automatically runs and mines the data and i can display the updated graphs any time.

I have been working in my company for about a year, I was hired as a Data Analyst making 60k/year in California. I have expanded my role quite drastically beyond the job description, which was originally limited to reporting and analysis. As the first person at this company trained in data science, I have used my data science/programming/statistical analytics skills to create a tool that will net my firm millions of dollars per year. Leadership is very excited about this development, and we are moving forward. 

While I love my work, my team, and the overall work environment, I am concerned that I am grossly underpaid. Hiring in tech is hot in my area, and I believe I could increase my salary to $80-120k/year on the job market right now as a Data Scientist. However, I don't really want to leave so my question is, how best do I approach leadership about creating a new data scientist position and getting a substantial raise? 

Here are my current ideas:

1) Approach the leadership team now about creating a new Data Scientist position, with a higher salary and higher percentage of my time focused on revenue-generating aspects of my job. I could create a presentation on the benefits, and provide a report with current salary figures in the area, and they're already aware of the potential change in position just based on this first project alone. 

2) Wait about 1 year until testing and implementation of the new project is in place, then approach the leadership team about creating a dedicated position. 

3) Apply to other jobs in my area, and once I have a job offer with a larger salary in-hand, go to leadership to show as evidence of my worth on the market (and possibly accept a better job). 

My firm is notorious for being a little cheap, and I'm not sure how long it would take for someone to come and offer me a raise on their own volition. I already received a small ($2k) raise in my first 6 months which is great. It is clear that I am valued, and people see the obvious benefit in continuing this work. 

The worst part about waiting for testing and implementation to make my pitch is that the time delay will mostly be due to other time commitments in my current position, due to having to focus on lower-value tasks. Additionally, while the big leadership is super excited, my immediate boss is near retirement, sometimes naps in the middle of conversations, and perhaps doesn't totally understand the value of this work. He will slow down progress and also likely stand in the way of a large raise as long as I'm working directly under him.

Given that it's common to bring only probably 1\-5 people in for 3rd/4th round, multi\-hour interviews, I think this to be anomalous. I've had over 100 data science / statistician interviews in total. I've passed technical interviews in insurance, banking, technology, agencies, government, and more. I've done probably a dozen exercises to prove my skills that have almost always led to another interview. The usual feedback is that I'm smart, professional, but that the hiring team liked another candidate more. 

I'm at a loss trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong seemingly almost every time that is somehow not caught earlier in the process. Am I just the perfect mediocre candidate that people string along as a last resort if they can't find someone better?

I'm just getting really burned out. I'm mainly looking now because my company keeps laying people off and I can easily see it happening to me.

I have a small problem I wan to share in order to find some solutions. 
I have a random variable ( visits to a website) and 3 possible events that can occur over time, the data is recorded minutely and the events are:
E1 = a TV spot appear advertising the site
E2 = a Radio spot appear advertising the site
E3 = a TV and a Radio spot appear ( that same minute)

If I plot some histograms for this events i get something like this:
[histograms](https://imgur.com/up0TpFQ)
So it appears to be a difference. 

The question is, if i have the event E3, how can I say for example that x% of the traffic is due to TV and the remainder is because of the radio spot? 

So far my best idea is to fit  random  variable distributions for E1 and E2, and run some montecarlo that samples from this distributions and calculate the differences, but I don't know if there is a better approach. 

Many thanks in advance for your insights and ideas.

This isn't strictly data science but I wanted to ask due to the large number of subscribers. 

I was wondering if any of you have at some point decided to take time out from data-heavy work and do something completely different, even temporarily?

I ask because I currently work as a data 'analyst' for a multinational engineering company(30k+ employees worldwide), having joined it in December 2017. I'm a 25 year old guy and graduated with a BSc in Geography in 2014. Between then and November last year, I worked at an 800-person organisation in GIS (geographic information systems) and remote sensing, with a heavy dose of data cleansing. The new role is actually in a supply chain department but I had been looking to move on from the previous employer for some time and needed to be open minded. 

Mini job rant inbound...

Six months into the new role and I am completely apathetic towards it. Most of my time seems to be spent trying to navigate around internal politics and clean up crap because teams won't get round a table and have a proper discussion. Many of my tasks have come down to tedious data entry and reordering spreadsheet columns as a result.

Enough ranting! 

At this point, I don't know if I'm experiencing burnout but was interested to hear any similar stories. I'm sure much of what I've mentioned could be applied to other industries but I know many data scientists end up overqualified for their work so I wanted to ask here. I don't refer to myself as a data scientist but have done sporadic Python, R and SQL work in the past. I can set up and drive Linux via the command line having tinkered in my own time. 

Feel free to move this post if required.

Many thanks.",4,0

I just recently found this subreddit and I just have a couple of questions that I would like answered! 

Background: Currently I hold a B.A in psychology and am getting an M.A in Industrial/Organizational psychology. I just finished my first year and I came across data science as a good blend in my interests of using data driven methodology to answer questions. This relates to my masters because it can answer questions such as does one training method differ than another, and if so, does it create a huge impact in learning. 

My questions are as follow: 

1) I want to enroll in Coursera to start gaining knowledge in using R/python and other statistical software. Is this a good place to start? If not, what are some alternatives that I can look into. 

2) With the education I get from Coursera, will that certificate, along with my masters degree, be enough to apply for jobs that are data science? 

3) I want to get real world experience, but I currently have a full time job, and am going to class for my masters. How can I get real world experience without giving up my job or degree? 

4) I saw posts that state to get any data set and start asking questions and try to find the answers to those questions. That way, you can get experience. Can I make a PDF of my results and put that on my CV to show future employers? Can this count as real world experience? 

5) Because I have student loans and am worried about my financial security, what would be an approximate starting salary for a data scientist with my credentials?

Even after working as a Data Scientist for about a year so far, a lot of it still holds true in hiring, unfortunately.*

Im tired of all the Medium thought pieces on how to become a data scientist because they dont reflect the reality of getting a relevant job from the applicants side. And its hard, especially without a Masters/PhD.

The new 2017 trend for tech hiring is companies giving *both* a take-home assignment *and* an algorithm test before the on-site. And it's *never* a weighted average where doing well on the take-home can account for a weaker algorithm performance; it's always pass/fail.

What's worse is that even for the data science positions, I rarely received questions related to data/statistics/linear algebra, just how to implement these low-level algorithms like binary search and Markov chains. And having *any* bugs in the whiteboard code is a fail.

Its especially disappointing because the take-home assignments are often better/accurate assessments of data science work on-the-job. (assuming the assignment is a reasonable length/scope: one of my homework assignments took *16 hours*)

If I had taken 2 years to get a Master's degree, then *maybe* things would have been easier. But at the current rate of change in data science hiring trends, companies which want Master's/PhDs now would require only PhDs by the time I would graduate.

And having a PhD in Statistics wouldnt help at all for the silly algorithmic questions anyways.

Data science/machine learning has had a massive amount of hype lately, and in my personal opinion the hype is justified. And with all the free software and education readily available, there has never been a better time to learn.

Unlike software engineering, there are proportionally much fewer data positions available. The flip side to greater accessibility of data science is greater *gatekeeping*, and it's entirely possible that data science job hunting will become even *more* difficult in the future.

In fact, a few fellow Carnegie Mellon grads recently contacted me asking how to break into data science. I was sorry to admit that I didn't have any data science job hunting advice other than to *manage expectations accordingly*.

And have a little luck too. And its not the kind of luck you can manipulate with machine learning.",67,23

For me, I have a background in Econometrics and have been programming pretty heavily over the last 3 years. I only took one CS class in school  I wish I would've taken more.

As you might imagine, I spend a lot of time each day programming. I don't do a whole lot of data engineering  I'm more on the model-deployment side of things. I do build a lot of my own predictive models for work, which I have found to significantly ease my time spent deploying the model. Oftentimes, deploying models developed by other teams/individuals forces me to basically set things up my way, retrain the model using the same process/parameters, etc. Most of the other teams building models really don't think about the deployment phase, and therefore give almost zero fucks about engineering.

One of my other biggest regrets is not having taken more math in my undergrad. But I also am not that keen on knowing *that* much math  it really doesn't get me going, and I don't see myself wanting to take anything else after linear algebra, if I do in fact end up taking more math. I'm kind of looking for a role in analytics/data science that allows me to program (which I absolutely love) and do a bit of statistics along the way, without worrying too much about having to keep up with the really sophisticated math coming out of academia. For better or worse, it is really hard for me to get motivated about going back to take more math classes and potentially getting a master's degree. I like working and am very involved in my local community, and I don't want to give up those opportunities to go back to school. I dunno, we'll see.

Then I intend to do a classification model to just predict win/loss of the Home Team. If that goes well, I will dig and get historical spreads and make a model based on spreads. 


Say I find the perfect algorithm and it has specific features such as various yard differentials (passing, rushing, total), turnovers differential, home team vs away team, points/attempts. 


So after I train my model, and test it with a decent confusion matrix or AUC. How do I use it to predict future games since I don't have all the features used in the model? Is there a way to feed just the roster or teams in and spit out a W/L prediction? 

I want to make it into a Shiny Application where I automatically feed in every week's data so I can retrain and update predictions. 


In Kaggle competitions, they already give you a test set with all the same features, so haven't had to do this yet.

I've been lurking in this community for a while and I know the repetitive newbie questions can be frustrating. However, I would really appreciate it if some of you could share your thoughts on my situation:

I graduated from a top 30 school with an Economics and Finance degree in 2017. After working brief stints in Finance, Consulting, and Accounting I found myself out of work and dissatisfied with the jobs I'd be involved in so far. As such I decided a shift toward tech is the right move. 

I made this decision as some of the Data Science hype began to hit the mainstream media, and it influenced me to apply to a Masters in Data Science program at the University of Rochester. I was accepted and chose to begin my program this fall. 

However, after reading what many professionals in this sub feel about the industry, as well as their thoughts towards Masters in Data Science degree programs I'm beginning to get cold feet. 

I would like to hear your thoughts regarding going for the DS degree or if I should try to find a way into Masters in CS programs instead. 

Thanks very much for your thoughts and responses. ",7,0

I'm working on a personal project and could use some alternative viewpoints and input.

I have a data set of music artists that I have assigned genre tags to. There are 50 possible genres in binary style, so the table effectively looks like: ArtistID, G1, G2, G3, G4...G50 with a 0 or a 1 if the artist has any of those particular genre tags.

After stripping down the tags to only the top 50 (there were thousands but the top 50 held 57% of all genre tags) it looked like this table was perfect for some hierarchical clustering. I chose hierarchical because sub-genres fit into genres the same way that something like Wald clustering works.

I set up my correlation/distance matrix to see which genres were often tagged onto the same artist and chose to use 13 clusters and the results look great! Every genre is placed neatly into a cluster of like genres.

But here is where I am getting a little lost. Do I treat these clusters similarly to how I treated the previous genre specs, with each artist able to be within more than one cluster, or do I try to assign each artist to a single cluster. How might this decision impact, say, a regression I try to complete later. If an artist is assigned to a single super-genre it would make it easier for dummy-variable factorization, right? Anything else I'm not taking into consideration?

And since right now I have basically overlapping clusters, how do I decide which artist belongs into which 'genre' and not another it also could fit into?

Currently student in an engineering school in France, if nothing goes wrong, I should graduate as a multidisciplinary engineer with a specialty in Data Science next year. For this final year, I have the choice to either complete my engineering degree with a master in applied mathematics (as a double degree) or do an apprenticeship in a company. There is both pros and cons for those 2 choices :

\- I'm considering working outside of France and altough a *Grande cole* degree is extremely valuable in France, it is often not well\-known outside of it. So the applied math master would give me a way better visibility on the market.

\-I'm not particularly interested in doing research, but imo, data science is still very new and there is a lot of R&amp;D to be done. A master would be pretty much necessary if I wanted to pursue with a doctorate. And if not, it would be a plus if I applied for a more R&amp;D position

\-On the other hand, I often hear that practical experience is often more valuable. There is such a variety of degrees among data scientist (economics, mathematics, statistics, CS ...) that I feel like it's not something essential. And from the job ads I ran through, a lot were looking for applicants with practical experience (from Kaggle e.g., internship etc ..) 

\-On a difficulty point of view, the apprenticeship will be way easier, and will be less work (this particular double degree is known for its difficulty and overload of work). So the apprenticeship might be a safer choice (and a paid one! not that I'm interested by that for the moment though).

So how far off am I from my interpretation of the market ? Is there more/Is it easier to find job in R&amp;D (and is it also better paid ?) ? Will the applied math master be more valuable than my main multidisciplinary engineering degree with a specialty in DS ? Which one of those 2 choices will get me more chances if I were to applied to a job ?  ",6,6

So, I'm a 15yo boy who has been programming in Python for 1 year and half and I love maths also, in the sense of I study by myself some advanced topics to learn more and more and be better than the others.

So, I got interested in finance and data science in the last two months. I read about high frequency trading made using algorithms I could write in Python using some data analysis tools and maths formulas. 

I decided to dig more deeply and after reading some strategies I decided to try to write my own Pair Trading kinda algorithm. I started writing a data prices stock harvester to elaborate the Person's coefficient then.

First of all I noticed that there is no real documentation for pandas and pandas-reader module; I mean the docs aren't structured like others python built-in modules and this disoriented me kinda because I had troubles finding functions explanations. And also doing research and talking with people some told me that HFF trading will be died at medium term because of laws and co. Also I got told that if you aren't an institutional with a really fast hardware structure you wouldn't speculate on markets because of lack of speed.

I'm now really confused and disoriented if I should stop this or push the thing and write my own algorithm then try to collaborate with Quantopian that seems to license algorithms to trade with. I'm kind of lost...

I landed my first Data Science role at a company who generally develops products in the marketing space. And I wanted to get some feedback from your shared experiences. The company as a whole is lean (30 ish people) . I'm on a team of 3 and I'm the only data science person in the entire office. They contracted with someone else to create an algorithm for them and 6 months later brought me on. I should also say that I have been here for all of 1 week.  

Here is the thing. On the team there are no contextual experts (or even those with experience) for the use cases that are being cooked up for the product. I've brought it up once or twice that essentially I can run analysis on whatever we want, but if our assumptions aren't valid it isn't going to be very helpful to the user. I'm not sure if I'm wrong, but I feel like I really do need some information about what a ""win"" will look like in order to create an algorithm to search a huge database for like cases in order to do analysis on.  

So my questions.  
1) Am I wrong? Can I just assume that certain things follow and develop R code and run statistical analysis without some context? 

  
2) If you've encountered similar issues in your work how have you addressed it or worked around it? I'm a PhD drop out so I'm no slouch when it comes to peer\-reviewed databases and synthesizing research, but I really need to find away to drive it home that me spending a few hours getting into the use case from the end\-user perspective will allow me to make algorithms that are better. 

  
3) Any business acumen tips for a career transplant into an office setting ?

Thanks all!

Hi  i want to test if it would be possible to do artifact detection and/or  model order reduction on 19\-channel EEG data on an dedicated hardware  with a cr2032 battery (so ultra low Power).

So  far I would choose sequential PCA for the model order reduction and  self organized Maps (or k means clustering) for the artifact detection.

Maybe someone more experienced than me could help me with some remaining questions or tell me if I am on the right track:

* Artifacts:  

   * Can  you detect artifacts in the time domain, even when they are in the  frequency domain (I assume it is possible if you do something like  sliding window and take some samples at once).
   * is there an algorithm that has very low computation for the online evaluation.
   * I read somewhere that SOM is very outdated and nobody uses it anymore, is this correct?
* Compression:  

   * I  assume I need a data dependent compression technique. Is there a one  with lower computational needs in the online phase than PCA.
   * is there any data on the power requirements of online and offline computation of PCA?

I will test the PCA and SOM on EEG data in python in the upcoming week so I will keep you updated if anyone is interested.

Then a clustering algorithm will hopefully group the skews based on similarity of the skew description. There are a lot of distance matrix operations out there that I'm not familiar with and I'm wondering which one would be best for text clustering.

Complete beginner and at the risk of asking a really stupid question. How do Kaggle's test and train data sets work? I get training a model on the training data but where I get confused is how that model then interacts with the test data and then how you submit that to understand your score. I've read a few Kernels and they all seem to be doing it a different way which doesn't help me in understanding the fundamentals of what is going on here.

The course I have looked at is on Udemy and whilst useful, it uses the entire dataset and then just splits that into train and test samples as opposed to already having them split e.g Kaggle. That's what is confusing me

I've been working on a project to take athlete performances (say, in athletics) and try to determine which athletes are probably taking some kind of PED.  So far, I've been trying to do this via classification (SVC, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest).  Due to the relatively low incidence of people being caught using steroids or whatever, there is a pretty severe class imbalance (1\-2&amp;#37; minority class).  I've tried correcting that through both under and over sampling, but the best performing model I could come up with (a Random Forest) could only achieve an AUC of just under 0.70, and looking at confusion matrices confirms that none of the models are really that discriminative (though there's some question as to interpretation as well, as a Type 1 error might not actually be an error due to the illicit nature of taking steroids).    


So I'm thinking about coming at the problem from another direction \- anomaly detection.  I've played around with that a little bit in the past, based on some research I came across regarding the maximal expected improvement between performances for various sports (IE, improvement of greater than 1&amp;#37; is highly unlikely in a 100m sprint), and tried to do some basic analysis based on that.  I want to revisit that, hopefully using some more sophisticated anomaly detection tools/processes.

However, I don't have a lot of experience with anomaly detection.  About all I know about it is that it's kind of a subset of classification.  I'm hoping that you fine folks can point me to some resources that might help me to 1) better understand the strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions for various anomaly detection approaches and 2) get a head start on implementing something, preferably in python.

Any suggestions you can provide would be great!

I'm currently interning as a data scientist. So far the work has involved very little machine learning (or much of any work, tbh). Are most data science jobs like this? Should I be looking at other industries that do more machine learning? It doesn't even have to be deep learning (albeit that's neat too), but it would be nice if it could be something other than just ""Oh, we have [literally any data set] and we need to solve [literally any problem]. I'll only accept [linear model]? Don't worry about the choosing features, we can do that later.""

On one hand, as an intern, it's not my responsibility to select models or whatever. I'm also only getting paid (quite crappily) hourly with no overtime, so it's not exactly in my best interest to spend all my time on this. On the other hand, if this is how data science, I'm really concerned. 

How can I get involved with some more technical? Where would I even find those jobs? What should I search for them? Or is this feeling just because I'm an intern?

I'm trying to predict a good location for a coffee shop... I'm not sure if this is even a good project idea anymore but it got approved and now I'm a few weeks into it. 

I have an old foursquare dataset with check\-in data, and my idea was to see where people are going on the days that they go to a coffee shop; predict who will go to a coffee shop based on where else they go. This way I can look for a geographical area with a lot of these places. So I formatted it as 'user\_id', 'timestamp', 'venue\_category', 'coffee\_shop\_bin' where coffee shop bin is 1 or 0 based on whether the user went to a coffee shop on that day.

I have another data set w/ all of the current business locations in the DC area (I've narrowed the scope of the project to the DC area). Zip code, longitude, latitude, etc. I have no idea what I could do with this.

Is any of this usable in any data science models? I'm assuming it wouldn't work in logistic regression/linear regression because the output is either yes or no and the feature would be a bunch of different categories that obviously have no linear relationship. And a decision tree wouldn't work because it would just be multiple single\-node decision trees, and they would all evaluate to no because there's many more days w/out coffee shop check\-ins than with.

idk, any advice you guys could share for predicting a location would be great, or if I'm completely off track and you think I should pick another project, that's cool too. Would greatly appreciate any assistance... thanks.",12,4

Apologies if some of my questions have been answered already.

Ok Im 25 and I work at a big bank. My undergrad was in finance. I finished with around a 3.0 at public university (didnt exactly have my priorities straight back then). My current role exposes me to large amounts of data. I know a lot about excel and Im decent with VBA. In most departments at banks, if you know VBA and no one else on your team does, you seem like some sort of wizard. Ive enjoyed working with data and its gotten me really interested in data science as a career.

To start, I wanted to understand some of the math behind some of the stress testing and models we use at work. Ive gone back to school and have been taking math classes at night. So far Ive worked through Stats 101 and Calc 1. Ill have Calc 2 &amp; 3 finishes by the end of the summer. Ive also been working through CS50x to learn some of the basics and foundation of different coding languages.

I figured the r/datascience community seemed like a helpful group to reach out to about next steps. Ive been considering some of the online masters programs(these seem expensive but the degree could help on my resume). I guess my questions are:

Whats the general consensus about the online masters programs?

What are the best MOOCs a beginner should take?

Are there any books that you recommend reading?

What were some of the most beneficial early steps that you took in data science career?

For my research questions, I need to aggregate it a lot (it's probably 1/1000th the size once aggregated and my initial run should be doable chunk by chunk). However, I initially only need to aggregate it once, and I may aggregate it more/less/differently as I go along. It's obviously a lot of work on hardware, but it's (seemingly) a different thing than a huge database with regular transactions, or a giant ML model that needs the original granularity level.

In terms of tools and hardware, what makes the most sense? My goal is to get it done with relatively little learning (probably poor overall ROI) or hardware expense (same), with time being reasonably flexible (hours being fine; a couple days being acceptable). Here's what I've found so far:

1. Database and SQL queries, lots of disk space, and time. It appears that more IO, more ram, and more cores may help, but it's not totally clear how much. In searching, I kept seeing responses (for not quite analogous stuff) along the lines of not overthinking cases where data is much larger than RAM and just using a database.
1. A ""big data"" tool like Spark. I haven't used it, but I'm very familiar with pandas, and it looks like I could make it work. We have a HPC cluster, but I'd need to do some learning to make use of it if I went that direction instead of a desktop.
1. One or more of the above running on a cloud service. While this is an alright option for cost, there's seemingly a heavier cost of my time to navigate the vendor account process (even with the university's existing cloud provider) and my time to figure out both tools and using them in a cloud setting.

Initially I attended a large state school for 5 years studying engineering. My GPA for those years was a 2.4 with 147 total hours and no degree. In my last 2 semesters at that university I failed a few classes with the rest being Ds and Cs and had a GPA of around 1 and was thus dismissed from my major. I also had a semester where I withdrew and also dropped 4 classes. I took Electricity&amp;Mag 4 times (2 W, 2 F). I hated the small college town I was in, was not enjoying my major and knew I needed a change of environment. 

I moved back home and enrolled in a nearby public school (small branch of a large university, pretty no-name school) and am pursuing a BS in mathematics. Its been 1.5 years here and I have 1 semester to go. My GPA here is a 4.0, and I have excellent relationships with many of my professors for LOR. My GRE is 165Q/164V. 

I spent a summer as a data analyst intern and am looking to pursue a MS in statistics or data science 

What do my options look like considering I spent 7 years in undergrad and will have over 200 hours total from both institutions once I graduate? 

Ive heard Canadian schools mainly look at your last 60 hours, would those be my best bet? 

Im fortunate enough to have strong financial support from my parents and cost will not be an issue.

Based on what I've seen from the course handbook, the units within the econometrics course at my university goes into detail probability, stats, modelling and time series analysis. While the economics course is much broader and doesn't specialise in any one area.

I am thinking that econometrics seems more relevant to beneficial than standard economics but I know nothing and I would like to acquire enough knowledge make an informed decision when I choose my majors by the end of this year.

I've done my research on both Google Cloud Services (GCS) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In particular, I'm looking at their datalake solutions, Big Query and Redshift for Google and Amazon, respectively. I do have a preference, but I want to see what the community thinks is the best solution.

I'm a Data Scientist, but not a Data Engineer, and have never implemented a big data solution before. Depending on which provider we choose, we will also be using that providers Cloud Computing Services for developing models, so this is also something to consider. That said, I've typically only built models in Python on a local machine, and have not used cloud computing in the past, so easy of use is definitely important.

Would love to hear feedback from folks who have experience with one or both of these services, and especially those who have implemented the service from the start.

I work in a e-commerce company currently using in MySQL database and we are starting to need Big Data Solutions.

Ideas: 
1. The change in key metric can be a label, that way I can use all the change in features and predict the change in key metric. However, this doesn't give a explanation of our core metric and since there is a way to calculate core metric, this doesn't really help.

2. PCA or Dim Reduction to get rid of minor features and limit manual search space or give idea for order of searching. This isn't ideal solution.

I am currently trying to find out a way to find ""the"" leader in cause and effect relationships. For better understanding I jus give you a short example.  


For instance: There are three shops in a city. The assumption is that one of these shops is the one who changes prices and the other ones follow him (leader-follower = cause-effect). The question is how can one find out who the leader is? For instance, could the leader change his price for there main product by 30 cents in one our, but the other shop changes his price later by 5 cent steps in distributed over 6 hours.   


I hope you somehow understand my problem, I am open for a discussion, I am not here to find a specific code or whatelse, but just the concept of this problem makes me go crazy :D. . .

What should I be doing to find a new role?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8rvsml/currently_employed_as_a_data_scientist_but_am/,dsnextsteps,1529286335,"If this better fits the ""Weekly Transitioning"" thread, I'll be glad to delete this and post it there instead.  But because I'm already a data scientist I didn't think it was the right place.

I've been employed for two and a half years.  Graduated undergrad in 2014 and finished a Master's in Statistics from a top West Coast university in 2016.  I was the person my peers would go to for help with statistics questions and sometimes still get hit up by old friends to help them out.  I didn't do a thesis for various university bureaucratic reasons I'd prefer not to get into, and an internship I did between years turned out to have no data analysis component at all.  My undergrad was similar.  I'd take an internship or a research position where I was told I'd be doing interesting data analysis work.  Then once I got there it would turn out that I'd have no mentorship or that actually I'd be doing some other task that requires coding but no zero statistics.  Because of this I have very good technical skills in SQL, Python, and R, but not much elsewhere.

My dilemma is I've had two data scientist positions where I've done very little analysis.  The first one was sold to me as an analysis/engineer position, but I did one analysis in the full year and a month I was there and the rest was focused on data quality control.  I was laid off because they claimed to not have any data analysis work available for me.  My current position is awesome except for the actual work.  I've been there for eleven months and I've just done exploratory analysis and dashboarding, with zero statistics.  Both of these positions are at companies with around 300 people.  My current company has cool ML work, but a conversation with my boss indicated that he thinks it's a giant waste of time and that he won't let me take on ML work, even though it's one area where I have a ton of interest.

I'm at the end of my rope and want to do more meaty and quantitative work than what I'm currently doing, which to be blunt, bores the living shit out of me.  I'm a statistician by trade who has done no statistics in two years.  However job hunting has been quite difficult.  There don't seem to be many modeling focused positions even when I look for other job titles like ""Applied Scientist"".  I've been heavily targeting particular companies I want to work at and getting referrals, but have been rejected a bunch of times for junior-level roles where I'd be doing modeling at the resume stage.  I've had my resume looked over by a bunch of people and none of them see anything wrong with it.  Because of my lack of professional statistics experience, my resume focuses on my ability to work with a diverse variety of professionals and to present them information in a way that's easy for them to understand.

Based on what I've indicated here, what kinds of positions should I be looking for?  Should I be targeting positions where I'm doing modeling and predictive analytics positions, or is my lack of experience in those areas going to fuck me over?  I'm currently targeting large companies because I feel like the bureaucracy will allow me to get experience precisely in what I get hired to do.

Additionally, how can I convince recruiters that I should be hired to do explanatory or predictive modeling work?  I'm in touch with a recruiter at a large tech company who tried to sell me a Data Scientist position that turned out would be all A/B testing and dashboarding, which would be my personal hell as a career.  When I asked him about potentially taking on a meatier role building models he said I should be looking at more basic positions that are similar to the A/B testing one.

I'm quickly approaching the three year mark where junior careers usually end and feel completely stagnant and like I have nothing to show for it.  I have job security where I am now but if circumstances change, it's going to be far more difficult to continue on an upward career path than it is now.

If it helps I'm in the Greater Seattle Area.  There are some Meetups that look potentially nice but they're all sponsored by boot camps and I don't want to attend a talk that's basically a pitch for why you should give them thousands of dollars.  I have contacts at many large companies in the area, and those contacts can vouch for my enthusiasm and skill around statistics.",7,12

Little backstory. I'm a computer science grad from a Midwest 4-year University. It's not super prestigious, but it's okay. We've got a good football team, I guess?

My first job out of college was out of desperation: I needed anything. I took junior database administrator job because I needed SOMETHING to pay my student loans. It's not a great paying gig, but it at least keeps me from defaulting on my loans.  My total debt from that undergrad degree is down to just under $60,000.

I started applying for grad school recently. I went through some therapy stuff and it encouraged me to take the leap to apply to grad school at a few different places to try to get my degree in data science. I've been interested in the subject for quite a while and I learn well in a scholastic environment with tasks and assignments. Not so much with online videos.

I got accepted to Syracuse's program recently. I was a little excited about it but now I'm having second doubts. I'm not enjoying reporting on data at my current job. Running endless reports isn't fun. I liked making software, interactive programs that served a purpose. I deluded myself throughout my undergrad that I would make games someday and pursuon data science feels like a betrayal of that dream/goal. Plus the online degree is going to cost me $60k to finish. That's gonna put me at close to $120k in debt. That feels so soul crushing.

I don't know what I'm asking here. Do I go into Syracuse's program? Are there opportunities in the game industry for data scientists? Can machine learning be used there at all? Can a data scientist salary pay off $120k of debt? Before I'm 80? I'm seriously having an existential crisis over this and I need some kind of guidance.",10,0

They have given me my first assignment and doing it well would accelerate my transition.  

The question they want answered now is ""Is this specific failure responsible for missing quoted deadlines?"".   I plan to answer this by looking at the previous 100 cases and finding what percentage of missed deadlines are due to Fail events, and what percentage of the failure events are due to different error codes.  For context, I will include cases that meet the deadline and calculate the same percentages.  I will probably use  simple pie charts to represent the numbers. 

If possible, I would like to give them more information from the data provided and visualize the data well. Anybody could calculate percentages, I want to do something to encourage them to keep bringing me these assignments.  It may be overkill, but I was thinking of running a regression as well in order to give them more than a yes/no.  Maybe that failure is *only* responsible for missed deadlines within x type(s), for example. 

I don't want to be irritating and give them way more information than they asked for, but I would like to capitalize on the opportunity they're giving me. 

The information I have: 

Case ID

Type

Time quoted

Actual time 

Variation between quoted and actual time

At university I majored in math and economics and minored in comp sci. I just started working a week ago at a start up in Boston as a Data Analyst. So far it seems my job will consist of lots of SQL and python to build models using the data collected from my company's product (a website/app). My manager has implemented a model in python (can't go into too much detail) and currently I am learning how exactly it works and backtesting it to see how accurate it is and find out what else should be incorporated in it. Currently my background suffices but I can see that more advanced data science topics are going to be necessary in the future. In addition, I get $5300 a year in tuition reimbursement for either graduate degrees or certificates from accredited degree granting institutions. I'm wondering if anyone knows of good programs that I can get accepted into with my low GPA. I know UC Berkeley has a great certificate program with no GPA requirement, but it seems it is not totally online. There's also the Harvard Extension school, but their data science certificate seems to cover stuff I know or am familiar with.

Here are the classes and skills I already have:  
- Stats (econ)
- Probability (math)
- Econometrics (econ, linear regressions)
- Advanced Econometrics (econ, nonlinear stuff)
- SQL, Python (including numpy and pandas), jupyter notebooks, looked at Julia didn't like long precompile times

Here are some of the things I would like to learn more about:
- Machine learning
- More complex model building versus simple linear regressions and nonlinear stuff
- Apache Spark (manager mentioned it as something we may start using)

Currently I am also reading [this book](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/) at the recommendation of my manager, any good resources in that subject area would be much appreciated!

I know my GPA doesn't show it, but I do actually understand a lot of the things I learned in school very well. I was mainly a slacker/lazy with regards to classwork/homework and studying (those still in school, don't be like me!). I got lucky that my new job didn't ask for my GPA and mainly was concerned with my ability to work on technical case studies and my abilities in general versus my experience and grades. I feel ready to pursue further learning (a month off of school and I already miss learning!) so any good resources or recommendations on programs to enroll in would be much appreciated!

For example, say each city is a group and each parcel represents an individual within that group, with a few thousand parcels being in each city. I want to quantify:

1. How similar parcel sizes are between cities? (ie. Do some cities have big parcels and other cities have small parcels? Or do all cities tend to have the same sized parcels?) 
2. How similar are the distribution of parcel sizes between cities? (Do some cities have widely varying parcel sizes while other cities have uniform parcel sizes? Or do all cities have more-or-less the same variation?)

Average is clearly not the correct measure, at least not by itself. Variance would give me distribution, but the units would be meaningless and it wouldn't answer the first question above. I thought something like ANOVA could be repurposed for this question since it's looking at both mean and distribution. But it's really meant for hypothesis testing and I'm a statistics neophyte, so I don't want to misuse it because I don't fully understand it.

I have 40 CSV files; each one contains 2 columns - a time and value column.

  
I would like to consolidate this into one table by doing an outer join of the time column for all files, so that the final file would contain 1 time column and 40 value columns.  I attempted this using pandas merge method, but my local machine ran out of memory before it could complete.  I made sure there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the code by simply combining 8 of the 40 files and got the desired result.

At that point I decided to spin up a more powerful cloud compute instance on AWS; I chose one with absurdly high RAM so I'm working with 190 GB rather than 8.  It got further, but got the same memory error around the 30th file.  I should also mention that each file as quite a few rows - around 180K.

At that point I decided that I must be going about this the wrong way.  I don't think pandas is meant as a tool for combining such large datasets.  In my last job I used SQL pretty extensively and something like that seems more equipped.  My next idea was to try to do it in AWS Athena, which is a SQL like service that can integrate with the csv files in S3.  I assume there is no standard solution to this issue, but I just want to see if I'm way off base or going in the right direction.

I am currently facing a problem regarding building a neural network. First, I ll give you a general explanation of the problem and then try to build a toy example to make it more clear.

My data consist of text and float numbers as features. The goal is to classify my data into one of more than ten classes.
I want to build a network which can take both of these as input, but i am not quite sure how to preprocess my data and pass them as input.

Data preprocessing:
I used the tensorflow word transformer to create vectors of the words and build my own embedding since I can not use pretrained embeddings for this particular task.

Ideas and what I tried:
First I build an RNN and Naive Bayes just on the training Data and got some good results. The algorithms made errors because they need information out of the numbers.
Next idea was to set up a second input vector in a tensorflow placeholder and connect it to a hidden layer after the embedding and RNN layers which process the text. I am not sure how to do that.
My latest idea is to divide the numbers into bins and create words for them. These words will be placed at the beginning of the word vectors.

Example for clarification:
The imdb sentiment analysis example is very famous where someone tries to analyze if a comment is positive or negative given only the text of the comment. For my problem I also have the star rating which belongs to a comment and not only want to classify if the movie review is positive or negative but into more classes for example ""Fanboy post"", ""troll comment"", ""buyed review"", ""serious review"".

Picked up an M.S. in Stats in 2016. 

Haven't gotten to do as much in the way with 'true stats' as I'd like, but picked up a lot of experience with machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and even fiddling with architecture and putting things into production at a Fortune 500. Live in a large metro area in the Southern U.S. Was spoiled with a large variety of projects coming in and out fast and even had a DBA around so I didn't have to fiddle with legacy systems and pulls.

I'm looking at the job market and keep getting recruiter spam, and I'm noticing a few problems:

1. The pay ranges are such that I would be taking a pay cut if I wanted to stay where I live, and there are so few positions open for data scientists that I'm not even sure I could find another job in the area or even the same state. I really like warm weather and having a low cost of living! But, is this just a fact of living in the South, or is this more a matter of recruiter spam and anything posted to Indeed being biased low?
2. Looking at other cities, and so much seems to be defense work - some of us have moral objections to that sort of thing, yours truly included.
3. I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but... A lot of jobs are overglorified data analyst jobs. Not taking a pay cut to be your dashboard monkey, kthxbai.

I haven't seriously started the job hunt yet, but... Without conversion to perm, I'm gone in six months. Really wanted to convert to perm, but they just hired a sociopath two months ago who has been making my life miserable, and so I get closer to packing my bags. Don't want to piss off the contracting firm either. Just, bleargh. 

I'm really worried about career trajectory as well - do I need to do more data engineering? I kind of like the solutions architecture side of things and should be able to pass the AWS solutions architect exam, but don't want to risk being stuck \*not\* doing data science. I like the machine learning side of things. I've built out back-ends and can put stuff into production. But, vaguely, it seems like nobody looks for that with data scientists - maybe 'machine learning engineers'? I think I goofed with my career and became a unicorn after people stopped paying for unicorns and instead decided to build teams.

Don't know how to reconcile the 'not enough data scientists' babble from jobs babblers with the relative dearth of jobs out there. Sitting in tech Slacks for a few major metro areas and I've only ever seen a few data science gigs posted there.

I come from a software development background and have been trying to move into a data science role recently and I have a few practical questions that I'd love some opinions/discussion on.

1. Are relational databases still a good solution for large feature sets? I'm used to using Postgres or similar for storing data, but I'm working with a model with 15000+ features, and storing those as columns in a table isn't realistic (postgres has a hard limit around 2000 columns). I need to update these records periodically for retraining with the latest data, and I was hoping to avoid storing it all as a csv or something and rewriting it each time.

2. Are there any tools aimed at deploying models to be easily queried over an API? When doing web development I used Django (a python web framework), and I've been shoe-horning my models into that system, basically making a web call that calls my model. However I'm curious if the field has any better techniques for deploying ML models as web APIs.

I don't have access to data that I can analyze (would have to move into headquarters for this) and at this point I need to move into a new position/company that will allow that.      

I have taken only MIT's data analytics edge, which I thought was extremely fulfilling and exciting, so I've been at this for only a few months.  I know enough excel to use it in my personal life, but I've never had to use it in a professional setting.  At this point, I don't have a portfolio to show off.

Duties of data analyst 2: ad-hoc reports, monitors, analyzes, and evaluates with statistical tool to id variance, problems, and trends. Works on data modeling under the supervision. Executes basic models of proposed changes, helps to insure integrity of data  Experience: BA in healthcare or business admin, 3-5 yrs requiring analytical and technical skills in quantitative areas Skills: root cause analysis, knowledge/understanding statistics and modeling, MS Word, Access, and Excel   

Data Scientists positions ask for BA/BS in compsci, math, or statistics, experience in R and SQL

Either way, I plan to leave my position in the next 3-4 months because the small picture, routine tasks, and high level of patient interaction is sucking me dry. I don't really care much for healthcare, but I would be very happy to stay at my company as they have good benefits, pay (mostly why I've stayed for as long as I have as a glorified secretary), and do good and innovative work---I just want to feel like I'm part of that!   

I wonder if I should let my supervisor know?  We have a phone room in our building (typically young kids out of school) and she is very good about letting those shadow different positions. I just don't know how to go about moving internally, so I feel like my only option is to leave.   

My question: Should I apply just for the heck of it?  Best case, they create a entry level opening?  Or should I approach them for an informational interview?  In the four yrs I've been with the company, I've never seen an opening for data analyst, or perhaps I haven't noticed until now.  Either way, I don't want to waste this opportunity!",2,1

It requires heavy use of SQL to get data from teradata, our RDBMS. So I'm debating whether or not to learn R or whether or not to learn Python. As far as I know, python appears to be more limited in what it is capable of with data. It seems to be geared more towards automation. Both languages are capable of using an odbc connection to get into teradata and grab data. But I'm not really sure what language would better suit my needs if I want to get into data science. I've heard people that are proficient in data science scoff at those who use Python and pandas while I've heard the complete opposite so I'm honestly looking for some more opinions. 




I know python is also capable of machine learning but I don't know if the case is true for R. However, machine learning is also very very hard to pick up as well for python even if it is capable of doing so. So I can't claim that's a benefit if I don't know yet if I will be able to even do it",5,1

I took a three-month data science boot camp in late 2016. Since then, Ive taken various online courses (at Udacity, Coursera, etc.) on machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing. I even went through Stanfords course materials for CS231n and CS224n. Ive also learned TensorFlow and Keras and how to use them on a Google Cloud VM, since I dont have a PC with a GPU.   

Ive been able to do some relatively simple data science projects, like Kaggles house price prediction challenge or building an MNIST classifier. But what I really want to do is get into data science and machine learning for medicine and healthcare. In order to do that, I want to do some related projects. Ive found a few related datasets on Kaggle. For example, theres this collection of images of four different types of blood cells, for which I can build a classifier. Theres also this collection of bone X-rays, for which I can build a regressor to predict the patients age. So the data is out there.   

However, Im getting stuck building my models. Specifically, Im trying to build convolutional neural networks, but Im running into training issues. This is where Im wondering what my approach should be.   

Right now, Im essentially trying to build my networks from scratch, but thats not going very well. Im following the general idea of CNNs for classification (a few iterations of convolution and pooling, followed by dense layers and a softmax layer), but my models always seem to predict the same class every time.   

One thing Ive seen a lot of people do is use pre-trained off-the-shelf networks and then slightly modify them for the task at hand. I believe this is called transfer learning, right? So, for example, they might use Keras implementation of ResNet50, but modify only the last few layers. Is this what most people do for their projects? If so, it seems a biteasy, doesnt it?   

Another suggestion Ive seen is to find a research paper that describes a convolutional net and then implement it from scratch. Is this a common approach? Again, if so, isnt it essentially plagiarism or cheating?   

I dont really know what to do? How common is it for people to implement their own ConvNets from scratch? Do most people implement nets from papers or use off-the-shelf networks? Whats the most common approach?",3,2

I'll usually just outline the steps in a word doc but it's hard to keep that maintained and up-to-date. I've tried flowcharts before as well but usually run into the same problem with maintenance as the project progresses.  
  
I was wondering how other data scientists go about creating documentation for the tasks they perform. Are people just creating word docs, flow charts, using some PM technology, etc? I would be open to paid solutions if needed. We currently do use a paid PM service (Wrike) but we use that mainly for task management and not for tracking internal projects.

The majority of my job involves running forecasting models or segmenting our customers in R.

\*\*Work Experiencce\*\*

2 Years as a Forecasting Analyst 

2 Years working in Marketing Analytics in a B2B industry.  

2 years in my current role on the ""Advanced Analytics team"", basically just a central analytics team that does alot of our companies deeper analytics.

\*\*Current Skills\*\*

1.My R programming is really strong. I work out of R 30+ hours a week.

2. I am SAS certified,but havent used it in years.

3.  I learned to program in Python, i am rusty but better than i am in SAS.

4  Im strong in typical programs like excel and tableau and alteryx.

5.  My stats knowledge is decent and most of job is stats/modelings.

6.  My SQL is ok. I have honestly just used it to do basic data pulls.  I have never done things like stored procedures.  Im sure some entry level data analyst

\*\* Self percieved weakness's\*\*

1. I dont know anything about things like AWS, hadoop, apach spark

2.  My SQL should probably be way strong for the type of data analysis i do.  If you ask me basic syntax questions,  like order of statements or stored procedure type of questions, I may not know off the top of my head.  I've never really had to worry much about it with the basic querying and joing I do.

\*\*Issue\*\*

Alot of the interviews I am going on ask my alot of technical questions or outright test me .   Unfortunately, most of these companies dont seem to leverage R much.

For example,  I had a company put a computer in front of me and ask me to fix 3 errors that were present in this large SAS code.  I havent used SAS in years, so obviously i did poorly. However, I dont think i should take it off my resume as 1) i do have multiple certifications 2) I could quickly relearn SAS if i need to.  

Another company asked me to comment out a large stored procedure in SQL(10 pages of a word doc). Since, most of my experience is just querying a database. I only did ok here.

which brings to me my question

\*\*Question\*\*

I want to start looking to advance my career and switch jobs.  I am getting good interviews, since my background, and work experience is pretty relevent to alot of datascience jobs.  But, I'd like to increase my odds of getting hired.  Plus, I have free time right now to self teach and better my skillset.

So where should i focus my efforts?  

1) Learn  AWS.

2)  Practice up on my SAS

3) Practice up on my SQL and learn some of the more advanced topics like stored procedures.

4) Practice up on my Python

5) Learn another skill - Suggestion

6) Other - Suggest

Once i get a job offer, I can more focus my efforts obviously.  But, in the mean time while i have more free time at work and tons of vacation to burn, I want to start bettering my chances of landing a upward promotion in this line of work.",1,5

Many believe that you should get a computer science degree just because of the degree of prestige that comes with computer science. Other than advise me to go for a data science masters but some others yet even warned that it has a trash reputation because there has been a lot of bad feedback from employers about data science graduates not having the appropriate skills to do real data science. One of our data scientists here is average in SQL, knows no python, has never used any formal programming language in her career and has no course work in programming either.

It makes me wonder if I should consider moving further into leadership, or just focus on improving my skills. I always hated leaders which don't know what they're doing, but after seeing a few jobs I had, it feels like it's more important to know how to deal with different stakeholders and politics, rather than your raw knowledge. 


Would it make more sense to do a masters? Would real life jobs be still a better idea? Is it even worth having a portfolio except for my own confidence boost? What should the role of a Data Scientist be anyway? I think i'm just looking for my job to mean more than number crunching and ETL making and sometimes better decision making just because I know some stats. 

Tl;dr: a bit lost in my Data Science career, wondering if this is all to it or what exactly should it be about. 

Sorry if my question is a bit vague, I guess I just want to hear how other Data Scientists feel out there. ",31,84

(Sure, tell me to write k means and thats no problem but for this categorical clustering thing, i had to spend 3 days and still on going researching on literature). I am afraid of not producing something of quality. As i dont come from computer science, sometimes its slower for me to implement programming stuff.

I'm a Master's student in animal behavior focusing primarily on marine biology. I've had a fairly ""conventional"" education thus far from the point of view of learning the baselines and histories of general biology, ecosystem science, and psychology/behavior. It's becoming clearer to me that in order to excel in any scientific field we all need to become competent with handling of complex analytics and large datasets, which is not something I have extensive experience with.

I'm curious what direction to go in next; I'd rather not enroll in a full-scale degree in data science, but I'd like to build my skillset. I'm barely a beginning programmer. I recently finished the codeacademy module on Python, and have not yet used it for personal projects. Handling of data in my own work has mostly taken place in Excel. I have a Masters-level education (pretty rudimentary, honestly!) in general statistics, and experience using SPSS, but have not yet tackled R (statisticians have helped me when I need it thus far).

I'm curious what steps any of you might take in your personal education if you were me, as I'm not sure what direction to go in next. My sense is that for students looking to self-educate, there are tons of resources online. In my own project so far I've seen the need for skills in using R, complex data visualization, and possibly machine learning techniques. I know MatLab is also widely used in my field. Given that I'm just starting out and can't learn everything all at once, what would be the best way to prioritize my next steps? Do you have any favorite online resources or data science boot camps?

I'm currently a year out from finishing my bachelor's degree, however, I still have a low GPA (low 2's) and believe the highest GPA I would be able to receive before graduating is possibly a 2.5. During the past few years of my undergrad, I have had an extenuating circumstance within my home, as one of my family members has been extremely sick and thus didn't help my GPA. After graduating I will receive a BA in Computer Science, with having a part-time internship during the last two years with an Email Marketing team.

I guess, what I would like to know if anyone has been in my shoes, is it possible for me to be accepted into any graduate programs, specifically online? Would getting a higher GRE score/GMAT score change my chances of acceptance? Any other tips and tricks are appreciated.

\- What words/ emotions are associated with the drug? Maybe determine, if the user mentioned side effects?

# What I want

I need tips / help how to achieve that. Currently I am reading scientific papers and posts about all kind of machine learning and NLP things.

*  I have crawled about 2,000 threads with \~40,000 total comments from a depressions / mental health forum.

* Coding skills in Python, Java, SQL/NoSQL

In my understanding, the following steps are important:

* 1. Pre-Proecessing: 
   * stop-word removal (for topic modelling) , 
   * POS-tagging
   * Lemmatisation
   * ...  

* 2. Topic-modelling: 
   * Dictionary-based approach  vs LDA (latent dirichlet allocation).  

* 3. (Maybe some kind of syntactic / semantic / dependency parsing)  

* 4. Sentiment Classification

#  

**1. step**

The first step is self-explanatory. I have to clean up the data, remove things like digits and stuff. 

\- Something I should focus on / especially look at?

**2. step:**

 Topic modelling is needed to filter out all postings, which are irrelevant. The forum threads discuss many different topics and in some of them, medications are mentioned. I want to get these posts. In many scientific papers, LDA is recommended due to its accuracy advantage over other algorithms. They also say, LDA is the best approach if time or resources are limited, since it is mostly unsupervised. 

\- Can I train my LDA modell ?

\- Would you recommend LDA or other approaches?

**3. step**

(Just a thought): After identifying relevant posts, I have to parse them somehow, to filter non-relevant / misleading sentences and phrases, since I only want to analyse the sentences which are about the drugs. Any ideas how to achieve that?

4**. step**

simple vs complex classification. In my understanding, a complex sentiment classifier analyses the sentences and splits them in emotions like ""happy"", ""angry"" and ""sad"", while a simple classifer just calculates the overall polarity. 

What do you think, would be the better approach? I think, a complex classification could help to determine (especially in negative sentiments), why a medication got a negative sentiment score.

I've started working on a [Python package](https://github.com/johnwmillr/SportradarAPI) that makes it easy to interface with the Sportradar sports APIs. Sportradar provides tons of data on tournaments, teams, players, etc. The package currently only supports the International Soccer API, but I plan to add more sports (NFL, NBA, etc.) in the future. Sportradar is a paid service, but you can sign up for a [free trial](https://developer.sportradar.com/member/register) that gives you 1,000 queries.

You can install the package with `pip`:

    $pip install sportradar

I wrote a [blog post](https://www.johnwmillr.com/fifa-world-cup-data/) that shows how to use the package and provides visualizations of some of the data I collected. I hope the package can be of some use to this community! I'd love to see what projects people come up with using the package, and I'd appreciate any feedback you may have.

I studied Econometrics in university. I work at a Fortune 15 company.

It has been a long year. We have a massive initiative this year within our group to stand up an entire machine learning/DS CoE for our domain. We have a ton of buy-in from senior leadership (I even presented one of our products to the CIO of the company a few weeks back), and it's kind of a ""strike-while-the-pan-is-hot""-type of year for us.

However, I feel like I spent most of my time just wading through shit use case ideas, where ML isn't the optimal approach, or the output is ill-defined. Square-peg-in-a-round-hole stuff. We have a couple of good wins so far, and some other good use cases in the pipeline, but are woefully understaffed (not from a warm-bodies point-of-view  we have plenty of team members). We have more engineers than we know what to do with, and not enough people who are independent and can see the end-to-end vision of an ML idea. Queue me working every weekend this year because of the amount of work that is shoved on my plate. But I'm young and out to prove and improve myself, so I don't mind it as much, especially during the winter. 

I like to learn, but I have next-to-zero inclination to go back to school for math/statistics. That idea just does not grab me. I love programming and general software engineering, and would consider myself an intermediate overall programmer, and an advanced Python programmer. However, the thought of leaving DS to do more SWE and becoming a code monkey also doesn't sit right with me. I love talking and working with people. While I do enjoy the occasional day spent programming, I couldn't do that for the rest of my life. I also feel like, while I don't think DS is going anywhere, that SWE has an even better chance of not going anywhere (i.e. always remaining relevant).

I guess I'm kind of at a crossroads  probably just pissed off and tired of working every weekend (some weekends are fine, but it might be taking its toll), and tired of shaking my head in frustration at others' lack of caring and competence before 7:30 each morning.

I guess I don't really have a question. I'd love to hear any advice folks might have, or if others are in a similar boat. I don't hate my job  I actually quite like it, when I consider what other jobs I could have. Perhaps I'm in a grass-is-greener situation. Cheers.",9,14

Is there a consensus as to 'Best Practices' or general considerations for data architectures that one should make when thinking about how to use machine learning for predictive analytics and enterprise level decision support?

I'm not necessarily referring to (but maybe) ad-hoc data scientist requests like: go find some data, wrangle a dataset, train a model, and classify a prediction. Often times, that sort of data doesn't persist (yes, I am making gross generalizations here).

What I'm wondering about is how an organization could approach its data architecture to make semantic connections across the various business entities and critical knowledge assets, avoid data integration problems, and exploit those assets to machine learning for various decision support activities.

Are SOA-related data architectures the best practice here? Maybe the Data Mart (master data management), or data lake approach? What does this community think about graph databases for enterprise level analytics??

Any thoughts??

Mods, if this is not allowed, please delete and my apologies. 

I'm launching a company intended to help a data scientists find a job more quickly. 

The products are intended to be:

* Resume Review &amp; Critiques $499 to $999 USD
   * includes a review of your resume and cover letter
   * email resume for a quick review to see if our services match first - if your resume is up to par we will not review it
   * Turnaround time is 10 business days or an extra $199 for a rush request
   * Additional services available to help customize cover letters for specific postings, $499 USD for 6 job postings
* Portfolio review $499 USD
   * Review your data science portfolio on GitHub or your own page
   * Review methodology and presentation, offer suggestions for improvements or projects to illustrate skills. 
   * Code Review
* Data Science Pathways $999 USD
   * intended to be for Data Scientists who want to either move up in their career or are just starting out. 
   * Evaluation of current skill set and future goals
   * Development of an individualized road map with scheduled check ins at 6 months to a year

Why you should consider it:

* Investments in yourself early in your career pay off dividends for the rest of your life. 
* This is focused on data science/analyst resumes. Most services are from HR professionals who do not understand the industry
* If I do not feel like my services are a good fit for you, because you already have an adequate resume, plan or portfolio I will say that up front and not take your money. 

Who am I?  
I am a professional data scientist with over 15 years of experience, working both in private and public sectors. I currently lead a data science team. Some examples of projects I've completed:

* Fraud detection reducing fraudulent claims by \~$40 million dollars
* Optimization routines - reduce reporting time from 4 months to 1 month with less resources
* Enterprise pipeline development
* ML models to predict caseloads
* Spatial analysis for weather and climate data to predict weather impacts
* Crop analysis to determine and predict crop yields based on satellite data
* Simulations for process improvements and determining bottle necks

Before launching I do need some unbiased reviews - not from friends or family - so I am kindly requesting 3 volunteers. 

I'm hoping for one of each, please DM me directly with the service you want reviewed in the subject line. I'll post back once I've had enough candidates.  If you're interested in the paid service or have general feedback please feel free to DM as well, or post here if you'd like.

Ive completed udemy courses on both and have just been going back and forth between the topics reading through chapters on certain skills I want to further develop.

Well it seems that im going at a fast rate, good chance Ill finish an introduction to statistical learning in the next 1-2 weeks. Also, most of the topics in R for data science remaining dont make me go wow I really need to get better at this right now.

Im guessing I need to start diversifying my horizons. Im thinking either Tableau, SQL, or Hadoop. I know SQL, but bought an advanced SQL udemy course for the future. However, I have no roadblocks working with SQL at work. Tableau is probably a good idea because itll be easier to learn, and I could get a license to use it at work. However I do have PowerBI experience so I dont know if its a huge resume improvement, Hadoop probably is the most diverse skill to add to my skillset. Issue is, idk how attractive that skill is to employers, and I wont be able to use it at my internship this summer.

Just wanted to see what you guys would recommend in terms of picking up new skills. Python is an obvious option, but still working on R Id rather focus on something more unrelated to learn.",3,4

I would like to go with the X1 Carbon (Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Generation, Core i7-8650U 14, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD) due to its weight yet pretty good specs. However, my question is if anyone has experience with serious data science on such a machine?
Since it doesn't have Nvidia GPU it cannot do any GPU calculations with TensorFlow, which I will be moving into for certain projects. Will this be a major bottleneck?

The alternatives are heavier machines:

Lenovo P50 - Core i7-6820HQ 15.6, 32 GB, 256 SSD 
Lenovo P52s, Core i7-8650U 15,6, 32 GB, 512GB SSD 
Lenovo T580- Core i7-8650U 15,6 16 GB Ram, 512 GB SSD 

I'm surprised that the specs for these beasts are identical in the X1 (except the GPU), so if that is not a major thing, then I would obviously like the smaller one.

It is a rolling 30-day model, meaning that I forecast a 30-day block of time using historical performance for past 30-day blocks (rolling).

So in essence I map out growth in our leads, and using the past conversion percentage, and trend in conversion rates, I project based on those to factors. 

E.G: Leads 30 days ago were at 100 per 30-day period. Today they are at 150, so a 50% increase. 

If we use 50% as the 30% growth rate, I then use the conversion rates on previous leads to forecast sales on a go-forward basis.

Keep in mind that since the model is ""rolling"" every day, as lead data comes in, the 'growth' rate could change and in turn change the go forward projection, so it is a 'live model in theory. 

There's a few things I'm concerned about.

In order to get the 30-day growth rate, I am just taking LEADS_30DAYS_AGO and LEADS_TODAY and measuring that growth. Every day the relationship between these to values changes as we move one cell down on the sheet. It seems this only allows for a very short-sighted trend that doesn't yield a stable growth curve. In other words one bad 2 week stretch makes my projections forecast a downtrend, which may not really be the case. 

45-day makes it a bit better, but in general I'm hoping I can reduce volatility in the model.

Would love thoughts and feedback, and I appreciate you reading.",3,3

I'm here to seek help on how I can build a predictive model, in terms of methodology and what type of techniques are available.

I'm a report analyst who does visualization. Recently were ask to predictive volume of our business but I have no idea how to start. The prediction is nothing more than a good to know, ballpark type of estimation but I still want to make it as rigorous as possible. 

We are a call center that does survey business (made up). We have reps, each with a list of locations and they are responsible for calling each location and send them surveys as well as chasing back the surveys. One location can have multiple surveys. 

My end goal is predicting how many surveys comes back at the end of the year, at reps' level, based on how the reps are doing right now. I want to look at where we stand now, and be able to say based on current trend, we are expected to have X surveys coming back at end of year. To reach goal of Y, rep1 needs to chase back additional 100 survey this months.

How can I go about approaching this? I know I'm supposed to apply regression so do I simply gather all the data points I can find and do a multivariate regression? 

How do I account for non-numeric variables, such as if a location participated last year, they tend to have higher return rate, or first participants that would return lower?

How do I implement the model such that it captures last minute submission rush, as well as diminishing return which is when a location sends back most surveys, they tend to slow down on sending us back the rest of the survey?

I have things like past year performance and call stats (# of calls, hours, ...etc) but I don't feel like these are good predictors...

Really appreciate any help I can get here. I tried to learn on my own, but were overwhelmed with the amount of information out there and just don't know where to start. Programming is not an issue as I know a little bit of R. I just don't know where and how I can start building a model that can answer my question.",8,9

Data engineering is a very important adjacent discipline to data science, but it is often under-appreciated or discussed relative to its close cousin (Data Science). I still remember the first time I was trying to learn Luigi, and it was just so difficult to find useful materials out there.

A given row is a reboot of a machine  planned or otherwise. I want to use this model to better understand reasons why some machines are more prone to experience repeat events than others. Here are my data:

Computer|Date|Event|Type of event|n_previous_events_A|n_previous_events_B|n_previous_events_NULL|Operating system|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
A|3/1/17|1|A|0|0|0|Windows 10|

A|3/10/17|1|B|1|0|1|Windows 10|
A|4/15/17|0|NULL|1|1|1|Windows 10|
A|4/21/17|0|NULL|1|1|1|Windows 10|

C|4/11/18|0|NULL|0|0|0|Windows 10|
C|5/11/18|0|NULL|0|0|0|Windows 10|

I'm having a difficult time coming to a conclusion on how to formulate this from a modeling standpoint. I thought about trying to do continuous regression on the number of total events experienced at a given reboot time:

Computer|Date|Event|Total Events Experienced|Type of event|n_previous_events_A|n_previous_events_B|n_previous_events_NULL|Operating system|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
A|3/1/17|1|1|A|0|0|0|Windows 10|
A|3/2/17|0|1|NULL|1|0|0|Windows 10|
A|3/10/17|1|2|B|1|0|1|Windows 10|
A|4/15/17|0|2|NULL|1|1|1|Windows 10|
A|4/21/17|0|2|NULL|1|1|1|Windows 10|
B|3/25/18|1|1|B|0|0|0|Windows 8|
B|3/30/18|1|2|B|0|1|0|Windows 8|
B|4/15/18|1|3|B|0|2|0|Windows 8|
B|4/19/18|0|3|NULL|0|3|0|Windows 8|
C|4/11/18|0|0|NULL|0|0|0|Windows 10|
C|5/11/18|0|0|NULL|0|0|0|Windows 10|

But that seems to me like it would introduce a ton of leakage and basically be cheating. Unless I were to exclude non-event-experiencing rows (where `Event` = 0).

Then there's the idea of simply creating one row for a given machine, with the total number of events experienced over its lifetime (to date; some decomm'd, some not). But again, I think that's tough to do, because I truly believe the fact that the machine experiences certain *types* of these events is predictive of whether/how many events it experiences in the future. So this roll-up method seems to introduce leakage as well.

Then there's also the thought to take, given two years' worth of data, the first year's worth of reboots to train a model roughly of the form `Event ~ n_previous_* + OS + ... + e` to identify the relevant factors for a given reboot resulting from this event's happening. Train on the first year, then predict which machines are most likely to continue to experience the event in the future. I'm a little unclear as to how exactly this might look, but it seems the best route.

Any thoughts from anyone out there? I imagine this is a very common problem, that many of you have dealt with. **Basically, how do you best incorporate the fact that a machine failed previously to predict future failures?** What does that look like, formally?

I have finished my university studied computer science with major in artificial intelligence. have taken multiple MOOCs in python, Matlab, machine learning, data analysis, visualization during my studies and won the data analytics hackathon. For my final year project, I have done a research on medical imaging and published 3 conference papers (*not in reputable conferences just the Q3 type*). Have started as a freelancer and worked with post-grads and some companies on machine learning and deep learning projects.

I have got involved a lot with the local tech community and even had organized multiple workshops to introduce Machine learning and Data Science to students, working professional, and interested individuals.


**Career:**

I have been hired as a data engineer for a firm that provides services in multiple business verticals mostly in the telco industry. My senior was particular about my skills set and how it gonna compliment the efforts of the team. First few weeks after I joined my senior had left the job(resigned due to some politics that I had no idea about), the company abandoned his project, I was in the limbo.

I knew I should leave, but I decided to try to make it work and initiate some projects and try to make it work for me. I have no backup, and my salary is what keeps my floating, my freelance is unstable and resigning was not an option as I will get into poverty right away. It was my first job and just worked for a month so had no savings, not from a rich family and I cannot ask for support. This is why I didn't consider leaving.

Trying hard to make things happen and work some projects. Didn't work well and there was a complete absence of data strategy for the company. No cooperation from other departments . especially ones that are essential to my work. Like the network operation unit that doesn't provide me with proper access to databases (I barely can do select* from tablex) and gave me only access to production database so any mistake can get me fuc**d and fired for screwing the production database.

As I told you poor me tried to work this shit out because I don't want to starve for another god knows how many months before I land a proper job again.

Today after 7 months of faking it to make it. I have gotten all the solutions and spirit in me dry. I have provided my analysis on some cases and tried to push something whenever possible. They have even rejected to purchase a  software where I can share my dashboards live with the respective parties. 

**Breaking point: **

I have worked for 8 months as freelancer and 7 months as a data scientist with this firm. I have no soul to go to job and wake up every morning only because the thought of being hungry is creeping me out. Very small savings that will not last more than a month. I want to resign now while writing this. I have 2 interviews coming this week and nothing is guaranteed.

I don't feel as confident about myself and my skills as I was before, I don't know if any I can land a job. I feel like I didn't develop myself well while in this job and it makes me being seen as junior data scientist rather than one who is going further in his track.

Need help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8udkpx/i_am_a_geospatial_and_economic_data_analyst_who/,lebronkahn,1530135149,"Hi,

I have been lurking on this sub for several days and I have realized how much more I still need to learn by not understanding half of what people are talking about here.

I graduated from grad school in 2016 with a master in Geosciences. Useful in the way that I learned about GIS and took a course in Data analysis using Python. But my knowledge of analytics is still very rudimentary. 

Right now I am working as a Geospatial and Economic Data Analyst, which means I use ArcGIS and a very niche economic software that I don't think anyone else uses. And as for pure data analysis, I mainly use Excel. Have been trying to shift to Python, but due to my insufficient programming knowledge, it hasn't been very successful.

Currently I am trying to find a job in DC Metro area as my gf is living there. To increase my chances, I have been taking the MIT OCW Intro to Programming using Python online class to enhance my skills (Besides, I find out that Excel isn't great for repetitive data analysis tasks). I know my skills right now are nothing but laughable on this sub, but I am willing to learn anything step by step. I can work hard and not watch TV through the whole week just to accomplish it. But right now I just need some pointers for my direction.

I like doing GIS work and I also like doing data analysis. In my situation, is keeping on learning Python a good decision? What shall I do to apply coding language into GIS development or data analysis after that? What kind of skill set will land me an entry level data scientist job? Shall I also learn R or Stata?

Any advice will be deeply appreciated. Thank you for your time in advance.",96,67

We're working on baselining historic performance of a collections agency to forecast their supposed future performance without our services, which we collect a premium off the top of our uplift, in regards to the uplift vs. this baseline.

After initial analysis in R, including regression, decision trees and a random forest, we found the 2 biggest predictors were initial balance and months between last payment and receival.

Essentially since we can only have 8-12 segments, we've split the accounts into balance bands and payment lengths. Now we have 10 segments that explain risk relatively well but they are not adjusted for seasonality.

Since we only have 12 months of prior data, how to we ensure that we're adequately adjusting for seasonality so that we're not over or under predicting performance based on account receival month?

My current thinking is examine the data (200,000 accounts) at a top-down level, no segmenting, by assignment month and performance and create a weighting for each month based on deviation from the mean.",4,3

I hope this is the right place to ask this question :).

Lately i've been encountering a problem with my daily work: in the business i work for i have access to a lot of of raw data, however very little actually actionable information; I'm mainly talking about user activity and purchasing histories. Once i've dealt with the surface conclusions from the basic reports i'm left with trying to make more in depth connections to better understand what makes my users tick, however i'm encountering that Excel is not the most optimal tool for me at this point. Medium data sets (tens of thousands of entries with tens of attributes, interlinked between different sheets) seem to make the process extremely slow and cumbersome, not even taking into account the processing/formatting required due to having information from different systems (both commercial analytics tools and proprietary reporting systems) .

Now what do i hope to achieve with this thread? Hopefully, with the help of your collective experience, a way forward since right now i feel a bit stuck not knowing what to start with. I do have some basic understanding of CS/statistics , but since i'm not using most of the parts on a daily basis (i'm oriented towards a more commercial role atm) i could do with a refresher (which i'll do once i know what i actually need to make happen :) ). First of all it feels like i need more speed in processing and visualizing data for bigger data sets. And second of all i don't know all the time what i'm looking for, but in order to put forward some hypothesis i need a way to more easily visualize the data.

I read around and it sounds like ""making an acquaintance"" with R would be a good start. Maybe someone else was in this position before (""lots of data, what do i do now?"") and could offer their advice?

The goal of the centralized data would be to more effectively leverage reporting templates and share best practices. 

The situation I am dealing with is having many decentralized teams working within Excel that have access to different Point of Sale data sources, but essentially are the same type of data as all other teams. Point of Sale data can have different attributions and can be segmented different ways, but it all essentially boils down to how much product X was sold at location Y on date Z. Each team has drastically different looking reports, but basically needs to report on the same thing as all other teams.

I'd like to move all decentralized teams out of working in Excel, and into a database system. 

The current idea I have is to have a separate database for each team. This is based on a few reasons
* These teams don't necessarily want other teams to have access to their data.
* Each team could have access to additional data sources that other teams do not have
* Part of this process will require team members being retrained to learn SQL, or may already have SQL experience. I would imagine some team members will more quickly pick this up and need an area that would allow them to develop new tables and bring in new data, without impeding other teams. 

Is having each team in a different database a bad idea? Should I work to normalize the data instead and move it into one database instead? We are ultimately trying to mature the overall analytics of an organization that is probably behind 10-20 years compared to most companies of the same size. 

I have been reading over the different 'types' of databases that a company could have, and it would seem a 'system of innovation' is more of what we need (per Gartner).

Quick etiquette question: I recently applied to a company and went through a few rounds, but they informed me today they are shifting priorities and won't be hiring for the role, so that sucks. I did spend a good full day doing a take-home assessment for them though, and I thought it was a very interpretable task that I did very well. Would it be inappropriate to ask my point of contact at the company if I can upload the jupyter notebook to my github and link to it from my personal page? The data they used has been anonymized.

I currently work as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology in one of the medical schools in the Carribean. Its a good paying job but I was never really satisfied with what I do.

I have a huge interest in learning to program and data analysis. Last year, I started out learning Full Stack web development with Node &amp; React. I went on to complete all three FreeCodeCamp certifications. Though very satisfying, I felt something missing.

Thats when I started learning Python and basic techniques in ML. I am really passionate about learning more and taking it to the next level.

I am considering taking up MSc Data Science from one of the colleges in UK. Because, its expensive, I would like to have your opinion on this. I hold MBBS &amp; MD but my degree has no math.

**Advantages**

1. I pick up math and programming concepts fairly easily. 
2. I have 24 hours a day to do whatever the fuck I want.  
3. I'm already an iOS/Android engineer as well as a Python developer in crypto.
4. I can register for any bootcamp, MOOC etc. No limits.
5. Already casually half-assed completed some data science courses just to get a feel for the field and concepts. Have also browsed through Kaggle forums and contributed to Kaggle Jupyter Notebook answers. As well as set up multiple DS ready workstations with all the industry standard tools, libraries etc for analytics on a high level with small data.

**Challenges**

1. No formal CS training. No deep stats/linear algebra exposure. (but I do have some exposure; see  #5 above).
2. I do not find stats difficult but I am totally new to R, Go, C++, Scala etc.
3. No access to real-world setups using the Hadoop ecosystem etc.

To be more specific, I want to create the most efficient path possible to becoming a data scientist in the social media domain using the tools and concepts that the big players are using while specializing in ML, Deep Learning and Computer vision models.

I am currently trying to run a classification algorithm (XGboost) on a dataset I have (1,7M rows). My plan is to use the probabilities output as a score.

I used 15% of the dataset for training my algorithm and predicted the values on my validation set (85% of the dataset). The gain chart I obtain tells me that by selecting 40% of the best ranked rows of the validation set, I obtain almost 80% of the target population. Which is quite good IMO.

The thing is that I wonder if using 15% of the dataset is a good method, as most people use proportions like 70-30. What do you think ?

FYI I also tried run a K-fold cross validation (k = 20) on my dataset and obtained similar gain charts.

* The different models that I used before settling on logistic regression  (SVM's with non-linear and linear kernels). 
* Reasons for chosing models (interpretability vs performance trade-off). 
* A little bit of web scraping that I did using RPA platform (UiPath), I didn't mention this because everyone seems to be scraping using python with (beautifulsoup, selenium...libraries) that I am unfamiliar with.  

*Few other data science projects that I undertook when completing my web certs mostly because they are the most basic implementations that are assumed a given w.r.t data science.* 

* A TensorFlow model of CNN for digit recognition using MNIST data set. 
* Exploratory analysis with Iris Dataset
* Housing Price data set: Regression

*Education:*

I haven't mentioned any relevant coursework like: Linear Alg, Calc, Stats as I have an engineering background and I assumed its a given.
