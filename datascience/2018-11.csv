I have a BA in math, worked in data analytics for 3 years where I was dabbling in data science and didn't realize it at the time. After that, I did a 3 month boot camp for data science and learned boatloads. Now, I currently have nearly 1.5 years of experience with the actual job title of data scientist since my boot camp.

As a summary, I have nearly 5 years of working with data. 1.5 of which I held the actual title of data science. Nearly 3 of which I held the data analyst title.

They're solely working off salary.com, which I find insufficient for data science roles. The only differentiator between data scientist I, II, III is years of ""relevant"" experience.

In trying to negotiate, how many years of experience, aside from the years with the actual title, can I argue I have? What qualifies as years of relevant experience in data science?

Essentially, img is a mix of numbers. When you pass 50 images to R or weka to make a model, these images are in number form.

What the software is doing is saying when numbers x through y are the same across all images, that's the model which will be used to classify future images. Is this correct? And what type of learning structure would you use for this?",0,1

For example:

- ha, according to this plot the relationship of X x Y is blabla, that's interesting! it seemed natural to guess the relationship is bleble, I wonder what's causing it, is it just me, or maybe typo in the code, or maybe the data isn't what I think it is, should I trace it down, but I'd need to nudge Joe from dept X for that, ah let's continue first and see..
- hmm if only we have data on X, we could apply procedure so and so
- hhow does X's distribution look like if we look at subgroups YxZ

All those little voices ringing in the head muttering about this and that which doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on what's directly at hand... most of them could be pursued but we only have 24 hours a day... (and yet so frequently turn out to be crucial waayy down at later stages in the project)

Although usually there's some formal effort to capture those thoughts down as a written document, many of the original thoughts that fired typically 'escaped'... just wondering how do you guys handle this?

Would it be a good idea to voice-record the initial stages of the project? *imagine muttering to a usb mic while doing EDA, something similar to Sculley from X-files voice-recording an her findings when performing autopsy on the remains of some unknown creature :p

A couple of advantages voice-recording has over written/typed documentation:
- vision and fingers are already occupied, only need to use mouth to speak into the mic
- does not take up any screen real estate, only need to put the mic stand somewhere
- can listen back to it while jogging / washing dishes / doing laundry etc

What do you think of the idea? has anyone tried? how did it work / not work?

All the sentences do belong to one broad category. And my **end goal** is to provide similar sentences from the bunch given a new sentence belonging to the same broad category. 

**Approach 1:**   I started with TFIDF Vectorizer and got pretty good results. But it didn't take into consideration the order of the words or their semantic meaning. For eg. the words *sofa* and *couch* should be close together in the semantic space which wasn't the case. 

Words in the same context should be close together. And so I turned to Gensim's Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. 

Doc2vec doesn't seem to provide good results. 

**Question:** Even if I train Word2Vec model on the given domain specific corpus, how would I obtain a sentence vector? I found some stackoverflow questions regarding the same -

16,2018-11-1,2018,11,1,23,9t9xvp,Does anybody have experience rolling out self-service analytics to the business? I am really struggling with user adoption.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9t9xvp/does_anybody_have_experience_rolling_out/,IlluminatiJesus,1541082841,"(apologies if this is the wrong sub)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a data analyst at company of roughly 230 people. All reporting and data needs were previously serviced through our IT department generating data dumps from the source systems through a query builder GUI. In a nutshell, the business would need a list of customers, transactions, etc. based on criteria and the IT department would provide them the data in spreadsheet form through the GUI.

&amp;#x200B;

However, a year ago I was hired and my team implemented a SQL server data warehouse along with Tableau to replace the legacy reporting tool. The dashboards I've created are in use by the business and are creating value, but I need my time free'd up for more complex analysis as well as ETL work. Hence, we recently rolled out self service Tableau to the business. We had consultants come in alongside myself and train 10 power users from the business on Tableau. I've created about 12 SQL views from our warehouse that service the vast majority of their reporting needs, and they can access these views in Tableau and create the reports themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the problem lies. The business users are being ***very*** resistant to developing dashboards and seem to be very frustrated by having to """"""""code"""""""" instead of getting data from IT. To help them, I have created a business-specific user guide that shows them how to make calculated fields and reports, I am holding bi-weekly meetings to assess their reporting needs and touch base with them, and I am consistently pumping out new data sets that will help them get off the legacy reporting tool. They seem to understand the value of Tableau, they are just being stubborn about creating reports with it and seem to think it's too technical (lol) even though I've done the heavy lifting by putting clean data sets together.

  
Has anyone else dealt with a self service analytics roll-out? What has your experience been and do you have any advice on user adoption?

First-time job seeker here! I imagine there are a lot of post from people looking for advice, so I will try to make this as efficient as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

**Me**

* Physics doctoral student graduating in the next 4 months currently writing my thesis AND working a part-time data science internship (good work, but basically learning how to use SQL and usual data practices in Python; no model development or statistical work)  

* Previous work experience working at a medical company performing simulations and helping create processes for testing compliance with regulations  

* Graduate school experience included writing programs in MATLAB and Python for data cleaning and analysis  

* Minimal experience making regressions and models (I've spent the past year learning about machine learning in my spare time and understand the concepts, but do not have a significant Github portfolio)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Desired Job**

* Entry-level data scientist position a large company in a role that focuses on understanding data and building models for customer products   

* Working on a team under more experienced Data Scientists to learn technical skills and corporate environment details  

* Located in NYC, SF, or DC (I currently live in Texas)   

* Preferably earning $100K or more (I have a decent amount of debt from undergrad)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Experience So Far**

* In two months (Sept and Oct), applied to 100+ positions through a combination of LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, and in-person career fairs  

* Received many rejections within hours of applying from the big companies (Twitter, Uber, etc.)  

* Received 3 interviews - one with an ad-tech company, one with a financial services company, one with a data consulting company

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

* Given my limited time to develop my portfolio outside of work, what are the most important things to convey on my resume to try to get an interview?  

* Does anyone have any advice on how to do a job hunt for a location in which you don't live? (Applying online is not working out well for me)",2,1

I'm a senior mechanical engineering student with an interest in Data Science. I've taken Intro to Matlab, Intro Prob Stats, Regression Analysis, and Numerical Methods on top of engineering. 

A professor let me take his ML class for next semester (I'm only lacking a Complexity Analysis course). 

I'm a mediocre programmer at best in R, Matlab, and Python, spending too long looking for syntax help on the internet. 

Would this ML class be too difficult and out of my depth? (the class is 100% project based, no exams, just a HW assignment that is turned in as a final project)

TLDR: Is a ML class too hard for a senior MechE student w/ sub-mediocre programming skills?",4,1

Im in a new position with a retail company with a few million customers in my market and I want to clean out some general who are the customers? insights to share with my stakeholders. 

Im looking for feedback if there are any pitfalls in my approach I am not accounting for. Summary is below. 

Business Problem
- Customer-focused insights beyond top level metrics have been hard to come by for specific markets. Data is generally looked at globally and my stakeholders want to better understand customers to drive product and marketing decisions for acquisition, growth, and retention. The initial problem is just a lack of understand customer behavior outside of things like which products are purchased most often and google analytics reports. 

Data Availability 
- customer identifiers
- transaction data (some guest some connected to customers)
- product information 

Model Development
- clustering algorithm to find groups of customers based on first purchase information, lifetime information (orders, spend, days since last purchase, % clearance items, number of returns, etc), order variety at a high level (number of different categories and item types),  and overall spend % within high level departments.

I have about 20 variables and a few million customer records. 

I was planning to normalize all my data (its all numeric) and then run K-means to find the optimal number of clusters (10-20) and then report on the profile of each cluster and what makes them different from the average customer based on the cluster z-score average for a particular variable. E.g. this cluster has high spend but high returns. 

Results Activation
- We have some product affinity stuff in place, but lack understanding at a behavioral standpoint. My goal is to push out high strategic segments of customer types (personas) to focus on and figure out with the stakeholders the next step they want to take for the target segments that pop out. Who are the high value customers and what are their behavioral attributes? How does this differ from low value segments? Who do we grow? Who do we drive deals to? Etc...

Im planning to validate my clusters with a basic RFM model done ahead of time that will be left out of the modeling. Quartiles of decency, frequency, and spend which will give me segments like VIP customers and list low spenders and ones in between. 

Thoughts? 

Am I missing something? Should I consider something different than k means? Run PCA on the groups of variables I have to reduce the dimensionality? ",13,1

If you have good friends, University can also be a good place for you...

I was able to get good results on the distribution of Poisson, With the help of my best friend,**Daniel**

 and my good professor, **Dr. Elham Mirfarah**.

I suggest you read about it,Poisson is a very useful distribution in probabilities .

&amp;#x200B;

But But what exactly is the Poisson distribution...??

and What was my result ... ??

and What was my code...??

&amp;#x200B;

**Brief description of Poisson distribution**

Many random phenomena are based on counting the number of occurrences of a given incident at a given time or place.

For example, the number of phones that will be routed to a telephone center between 9:00 am and 11:00 am OR  The number of customers who visit banks between 12:00 and 1:00 OR  The number of crashes that occur on a busy crossroads a day.

The probabilities that I said depend on the lambda.(Lambda  is the average number of events per interval)

if you run my code you can get the output file. (Per your favorite lambda)

Specifically we are considering using Sagemaker but are unsure in what capacity.

1. **Option 1:** We use Sagemaker for our entire Data science workflow: from data analysis to training models to predicting in production? i.e. 5 data scientists using a single notebook instance to write their code. Everything in the cloud - code and data
2. **Option 2:** We analyse &amp; model the data locally and use Sagemaker only when:
   1. The data is too big for local
   2. It is ready for production
3. **Option 3:** We use local notebooks which run Spark (local, or connected to an EC2 cluster in AWS) - using Sagemaker only for the endpoint in production

To some degree I like option 1 as it would mean all of our team's code and data are one place (i.e. AWS), making it easy to collaborate etc.

**However the downsides:**

\- Paying for a Sagemaker notebook 7 hours per day, 5 days per week

\- As all the code in hosted in a notebook, it is vulnerable to being accidentally deleted if the notebook is removed i.e. how could we easily sync this code with Github...?

Just some context, I'm a full stack dev and I was given a data science task to analyze JIRA issues during a given time period across development teams (~14,000 issues). 

We are interested in looking at time spent in development, time spent in qa, how long an issue has been open for, how long an issue has been in progress, look at description length, story points  etc etc. Not sure what the goal is, my boss (who is non-technical) wants me to run with it and produce insights to show to executives. 

I have been unsuccessful unfortunately, given that I am still a beginner. I am mostly using pandas and matplotlib.

I cleaned my data (or so I thought), but then I ran into many issues later into my analysis. 

**Issue 1**
I scrapped together a bunch of graphs last week, then looked closer at the descriptive stats of the issues and noticed the minimum value for things such as time in dev and time in qa were negative numbers, which wasn't correct. 

There were special edge cases that result in negative numbers when I parse through the transitions using my python functions, such as someone will put something in QA but it will never actually get approved for production and just immediately put into as Resolved. 

**Issue 2**
There were story points that were outrageously high (~100 something), we operate on 2 week sprints so we should never have tickets pointed that high. I have no idea what to do with these outliers and what to make my cut off.

**Issue 3**
I also noticed that the raw data (pulled from JIRA export) had an issue that was pointed as 21, but JIRA showed it as not being pointed. I went back to JIRA search, looked up the issue, and exported that issue into a .csv (as I did with the original data) and the value was correct (null). 

**Issue 4**
I have to go back and recollect my data because I found a discrepancy in the raw data. I tried pulling it via the python API but I end up getting a 504 error on some JIRA boards (~1200 issues) because I am pulling too many issues. Not to mention, it takes forever to pull even 600-800 issues.

I went a different route and just chopped up each board into certain dates, exported those manually into .csvs from JIRA, then combined them into a single .csv (per team's board).

**Issue 5**
There are so many variables in my dataframe, so many columns that need to be chopped or combined into a single column (labels). I'm in this narrow mind set of comparing variable a to variable b and I'm just busting out bar graphs/stacked bar graphs and scatterplots looking for a trend. I'm overlooking details such as outliers and many other things.

My boss is expecting a demo next week because I failed to deliver this week. I tried showing her some graphs and she said ""I don't want graphs, I want insights"". 

Any advice would be much appreciated, I am stressing out about this and I want to make sure I do things the right way.",2,1

I'm a Data Scientist of three years, though 85% of my job somehow turned into web analytics (Adobe Analytics, primarily). In terms of software, I mainly work in Excel, Tableau, and JMP, with R or SQL filling in the remaining 15% where I need to do something super specific.

Throughout school and professionally, I've only ever worked in a Windows environment. That said, I'm the only one at my agency on a PC, and it creates a lot of little headaches when it comes to timesheets, VPN access, and projecting in conference rooms (we use Apple TV, with nary an HDMI cable to be found).

Pardon my ignorance on the subject, but beyond any initial learning curve, am I going to find myself handicapped in any way by switching to a Macbook? Have we reached an age of software parity between OS's?

I am trying to assess the effect of a treatment on the patients, and as I am trying to replicate a randomized experiment from a observational study, I am performing matching between the treatment and control group.

When I try to perform Mahalanobis distance matching, however, I keep getting the following warning on Matlab: ""Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate. RCOND = 6.545651e-27.""

The warning was caused because the determinant of my Covariance matrix was very close to 0, so when I calculated the inverse of this matrix (as I need to do for finding the mahalanobis distance), the matrix element values become very close to 0 as well. After reading about this warning a little bit, I found that when this warning is displayed, the results of mahalanobis distance matching isn't very reliable.

I thought this was because my matrix became very sparse after I introduced one-hot-encoding to split the multi-categorical features into many different features, and hence some of my new features were for category values that had very few occurrences (less than 3%). To address this issue, I got rid of the category values with very low occurrences (less than 3%) or binned them together with other low-occurrence category values into slightly larger bins so their chances of occurring increased, and my data-matrix was less sparse.

So, I reduced the number of features from 42 to 33 and I plotted the histograms for all my 33 features to see their distributions and this is what it looked like (note that the element values have been normalized to 0 by subtracting the feature mean and then divided by the feature standard deviation):

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/v377n.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v377n.png)

It looked visually satisfactory to me, but I still kept getting the same warning in matlab. When I tried finding the determinant of my new covariance matrix, it was still very small (1.6379e-23).

In a further attempt to fix this issue, I checked whether removing all 4 of the categorical features (13 if we consider the one-hot encoded features) made things any better by making the matrix less sparse. The new feature-histogram looked like this:

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5lQz.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5lQz.png)

This time, when I tried Mahalanobis distance matching, the warning was removed because the determinant of the covariance matrix was larger (1.3407e-05).

So I tried to see if I could include one of the removed multi-categorical features without facing the same problem (as these are important features I would prefer to include when doing my matching). I added a categorical feature with 3 possible values and all the values very well distributed (see histogram below)

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LdMQ.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LdMQ.png)

But alas, simply including these 3 new one-hot-encoded features seems to cause the determinant of the covariance matrix to become so small that I start getting the same warning in Matlab.

Is there any fix to this issue? Or is it simply impossible to reliably perform mahalanobis distance matching on this data-set without leaving out the multi-categorical values?",7,1

&amp;#x200B;

[Cars, Clouds, Dogs, Houses](https://i.redd.it/twb5ssp30bw11.jpg)

Obviously I want to create a means of categorizing them using a clustering algorithm. The three clustering algorithms I have selected are K-means, Self Organizing Maps, and Affinity Propagation. 

For K-means and Affinity Propagation both require a similarity matrix. That is how similar are the images, but I do want this to be unsupervised. That is, I can easily bias the results by constructing the similarity matrix myself however I want an algorithm to do this for me. 

I have tried using an algorithm called Mean Square Error. It takes the pixel location of (X,Y) of image X1 and Image Y1, a takes a squared error calculation by subtracting the luminosity value of each pixel and squaring the value. I sum all pixels then get the mean. This is my similarity value between Image X1 and Y1. I do this for each Yn, then for each Xn for each Yn. 

This approach doesn't work for this at all. I am currently using the olivetti faces database to test for Affinity Propagation and the algorithm works for that database, so I know my algorithm for AP works. It must be my method for calculating similarity between images. 

I really have no leads on other ways to calculate similarity between images. The only other way I can think of is the run an image processing for each image in order to find some ""pattern"", then compare the patterns. 

My question is what algorithms exist for a computer to calculate a ""similarity"" between two distinct images. That is for ImageX1 and Image Y2 in my above grid (the first and second image). These are both cars, but different cars and in a different position. Therefore the similarity should be better than say if I were to compare Image X1 and Image Y6 (the image at position 0,0 and the image at position col 0 and row 6). This is a car and a cloud. These should produce a very different similarity value, definitely something less than comparing two cars. 

I realize this might be under computer vision, so I am looking for algorithms that I can plug images into a get a similarity matrix generated.

A bit of background -- I have an undergrad degree in chemical engineering and have spent the early part of my career in biotech. Looking to move to into data science/analytics in the future, and am currently enrolled in a MS in Analytics while working full time.

I wanted to ask for some advice/thoughts on what I need to be doing to best prepare myself to move into the data science industry after I have my degree. There will be one major project we'll do as part of the degree, but my plan is to complete some individual (maybe Kaggle?) projects as well to boost my skills/resume. Anything else I should be doing to prep for the career transition after completing the MS degree? My concern is, as my background is engineering/biotech, my lack of true coding/analytics history and projects could increase the difficulty in the initial job search. Obviously there are lots of skills from my current career that will translate (basic stats, project management, technical writing, problem solving, industry knowledge, etc), but not many directly related to data science.

1. Which language do I need urgently? some low level languages e.g. C/C++ ?
2. Any other scripting language beside R and Python? JavaScript?
3.  Is SAS Data Scientist Certification be helpful?
4. Which big data database management? e.g. noSQL / Hadoop?

I created this throw-away to get some unvarnished career advice. I have a PhD in a physical science received some years ago. I have been working primarily in non-technical areas since then - but I have worked on upgrading my technical skills, learning python, R, sklearn, etc. and doing projects in those languages - and have plotted a career change into Data Science. Data science, I think, will give me much more location flexibility than my prior career path. I am currently between jobs.

I have an offer, my first! But the location is not my first choice. My question is - is the data science market so tight right now that I could reasonably expect more offers to follow? Perhaps, in a city that either I have ties to or where I already live? To take this offer, I'd have to move to a new, unfamiliar place.

Were I to wait, I risk remaining unemployed longer - but I could conceivable find employment that didn't require me to move - or that would mean moving somewhere where I have friends or family. But I don't know if I should consider myself lucky that I found a job with no prior work experience in data science. Or if a PhD + newly acquired skills will lead to a reasonable expectation of more offers in the coming months.

Advice much appreciated, apologies if this is the wrong venue.

I am thinking on starting a Distance Learning BSc with Open University (it is a respectable british public university, I'm not interested on opinions regarding distance learning). 
 
Their BSc in Computing and IT does not look very appealing to me, specially because I audited their courses / exams and I already know many of those things, it would be a relatively ""easy"" degree however if I'm making the effort and also paying a considerable amount I would like to learn something. 
 
One of the options I'm considering are the BSc in Mathematics. With my current income I would have enough savings to do a full time masters in a reputable brick university without having to work, and I expect to get raises / etc along the way (I just got a 50% raise after 10 months working in my current position). 
 
The curriculum for the BSc in Mathematics would be (note that in the OU seems like Level 1 courses are rather easy, where level 2 and 3 have a high increase in difficulty): 
 
Level 1: 

- Discovering Mathematics (very basic math, can be exchanged for other course which I would do, probably introduction to physics).

- Essential Mathematics 1 (covers Functions, Trigonometry, Vectors, Calculus, Matrices, Sequences and Complex Numbers) 

- Essential Mathematics 2 (covers Number theory, Conics, Geometric transformations, Mathematical language and proofs, further calculus, differential equations, mechanics, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, combinatorics) 

- Introduction to statistics (covers statistical vocabulary and notation, selection and use of statistical techniques. Makes heavy use of Minitab 17 software). 
 
Level 2:
 
- Pure mathematics (covers Group Theory, Linear Algebra, Analysis). This is a 2 semester module.
- **can choose between:**
 - Mathematical methods, models and modelling (another 2 semester module) (the description of this module is more complex, can be seen here: http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/details/mst210?orig=q31&amp;setAcc=true)
- **OR**: 
 - Analysing Data (more statistics)
 - Mathematical Methods (analytical (as opposed to numerical) solution of first and second-order ordinary differential equations is discussed, followed by linear algebra (vectors, matrices and determinants). Elements of the calculus of functions of several variables, including vector calculus, which is followed by an introduction to methods for solving partial differential equations.

Level 3:

- **4 of the following:**
 - Applications of probability
 - Complex analysis
 - Deterministic and stochastic dynamics
 - Electromagnetism
 - Further pure mathematics (number theory, groups, numbers and rings, metric spaces, rings and fields)
 -  Graphs, networks and design
 -  Linear statistical modelling
 -  Mathematical methods and fluid mechanics
 -  Mathematical statistics
 -  Optimization
 -  Mathematical thinking in schools (no)
 -  The quantum world (no)

I have a BS and am about to graduate my MS in Industrial Engineering. My experience is heavy on statistics and manufacturing, with a fair bit of ML. Is there a demand for this kind of job in a company that deals with the movie industry? Not necessarily a movie studio itself, but maybe a consulting firm or a market research firm.

This includes questions around learning and transitioning such as:

* **Learning resources** (e.g., books, tutorials, videos)
* **Traditional education** (e.g., schools, degrees, electives)
* **Alternative education** (e.g., online courses, bootcamps)
* **Career questions** (e.g., resumes, applying, career prospects)
* **Elementary questions** (e.g., where to start, what next)

We encourage practicing Data Scientists to visit this thread often and sort by new.

I honestly love the work. The problem is that it is only about 15% of my job. Also, I am worried if I walk away from the current stable/secure/well paying job, doing something I love (Analysis in R) would cost me in income and security.

So my question becomes: what is the market out there for data science/ R analysts right now? Is it possible to get a good paying, stable job that might compare with my current more traditional IT role? Is there part time/ contracting work available in this field so I can get my feet wet?


The challenge is that I have no formalized training in the field  just on-line boot camps, books and 3 years worth of R experience. I also understand that R is starting to become looked down upon in comparison to other data science languages (Python, SAS).


So is it worth trying to take a leap into this field? Is there much available for a person of my experience and education?

I dont know if this is the right place for this question but I will give it a try. Apologizes in advance if it isn't! (Also posted this in r/algorithms)

Basically, I would like to develop a forecast tool which predicts the energy consumption for a specific city for the next day. I choose a city which is located near me to test this on. For this city I have two data sets: First: The weather data from a whole year in a 10minute interval. Here is a snippet of the data: https://imgur.com/K7w0u1l Second: Energy consumption data from a whole year in a daily interval. There are a total of 1660 power meters which provided this data. Here is a snippet: https://imgur.com/J5zoAAZ (Unit in kWh, every column represents one meter).

My question is: Can I, based on this past data, develop an algorithm (which will be feeded with the forecasted weather data from the next day) that will return the energy consumption forecast for the next day? I had an idea on how I could maybe approach this but I have the feeling that this method is very trivial. I will try to explain it to you with an example: So lets say I get the forecasted weather data. In this data, the average air temp. is predicted with 20 degrees Celsius and the average relative humidity is predicted with 80%. Now I assign both data points a tolerance range from some value. Lets say I assign the temperature a tolerance of +/- 2 degrees and the humiditry a tolerance of +/- 3 percent. Now I go searchig in my database. First, I look for a historical datapoint from the air temperatures where the value was in the tolerance range from the predicted value. So, in this example: 18 =&lt; x =&lt; 22. If I find one, I check if the value of relative humidty is in the tolerance range of the predicted humidty. So, in this example: 77 =&lt; y =&lt; 83. If this also applies, I save the date from when this happened and use the energy consumption from this date as my forecasted consumption. Of coure I would also need to account for new meters (because the city probably grows and so the consumption will also rise) and for the season in which the next day is in (because consumption is generally higher during winter than summer).

I also already played a bit with the historical datas and calculated the correlation from some datapoints with the energy consumption. Here is a table: https://imgur.com/I5Iz0Id As you can see, in sommer and winter the temperature had a high correlation with the energy consumption, while in spring and autumn the correlation wasn't that high. So probably I will also need to account for this in my algorithm...

I would guess that there are much much much better ways to do this with more advanced mathmatical methods but I'm currently only going to school and I'm not really familiar with higher statistics/mathematics. I would be really interested in any other approaches to this problem from people which are way more profound in this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

We sent our data to various vendors and they sent it back with their added features. **A good majority of features came back with 30%-50% NA.** Also, some of these features are created from the vendor's machine learning algorithms, and some of the data points may be imputed. We do get information whether or not the information is estimated. **Some vendors will also do a batch of manual requests for a fee to reduce the NA's.** The idea is to build a baseline model to put into production. And once we get new data, there's a chance we may not have all of the information that was used in the original model.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to initially run a random forest or boosting algorithm since they handle NA's and require minimum pre processing.  Then keep removing features with less importance and that contain a larger amount of NAs. Once I get a final set, it will help determine what vendor(s) to go with.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the baseline model I need to put into **production has to be a GLM** (per management). If that goes well, I can try and convince using more advanced algorithms with better predictability.

If not, any recommended bootcamps for Data Science? Anyone ever attend or have insight on Flatiron School, General Assembly, Mtis, or Galvanize? If so how was your experience there? 

Thank you!

I am not a data scientist (neither a student, nor a professional) so apologies if this question is below the grade of this sub.

I am making a web crawler to try to find web pages that match a certain criteria. I wrote a python script that takes a starting url and then traverses the web using a breadth-first search using the starting url as node-0.

My goal is to find websites for small businesses. My scraper currently takes all the text data from the sites it visits, which I am hoping to be able to turn into a classification model. My two questions are:

1) What are good starting URL's to make sure my crawler has the greatest likelihood of seeing a broad sample of websites?

2) What are some good algorithms/models I could look into using to say ""find websites similar to these ones"". I think there are NLP algorithms like ""bag of words"" etc. that might work, but just wondering what your 2-cents on this is.

After being passed to the sales team, the sales team attempts to contact the person and if successful a ""sales opportunity"" is generated. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my goal is to determine how much ""weight"" each of these interaction types should be given. I'm thinking about it as a regression problem - ""'probability of generating an opp' \~ 'interaction type 1' + 'interaction type 2' + ... + 'interaction type n'"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset of \~2600 leads, \~93% of which did not results in a sales opp. My idea is to create a predictive model and use this model to inform decisions about the lead scoring weights in the sales pipeline (i.e. the number of points given to each interaction type). 

&amp;#x200B;

I fitted a penalized logistic regression model using the brglm R package and have slightly over 93% accuracy, and the confusion matrix has only like 5 positive predictions. So, the model doesn't appear to be very informative (it is just guessing ""False"" most of the time to achieve the 93% accuracy rate). The AUC score is like 0.65, but it doesn't seem to mean very much given that the model isn't beating ""no information rate"". 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Recharacterize the problem? Try a different model (Bayesian maybe)? Downsample the False class and do some sort of bootstrap? Something else?  ",11,1

Kelloggs believes that, in this information age, databases can help to improve their targeting strategy and win back market share.  Therefore they collaborate with Dunnhumby in a pre-sales project. This is an important project for Dunnhumby, because if this is successful, Kellogg's will apply similar strategies on their other products too.  Currently, the main objective of this pre-sales project is to drive ROMI via high coupon redemption rate  This KPI has been chosen because it is a short-term and objective measurement  Further, Kelloggs and Dunnhumby agreed to focus this pre-sales project on the online Tesco customers since this will deliver results quickly.

* I am not opposed to diversity initiatives. They are generally done well with cogent support. Of course there are exceptions but these are not definitive (e.g. Blatant tokenizing and pretty callous bigotry).
* I have worked with many talented, competent women/minorities who are well deserving of the jobs they are employed in.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been in the data science job hunt for some time (\~9 months). I am working with recruiters and finished an Insight Data Science Fellowship (Remote Program). I have a reasonable return rate on call-backs (\~10% of jobs I apply to call me back) but I routinely get ghosted at that point. To put some numbers to it, I have applied to about 90-100 jobs, gotten 9 callbacks but only one technical screen (Some recent callbacks might follow up still).

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumed Conclusion**: Everything looks good on paper but something about the introduction is turning employers off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypothesis 1**: I am poor at phone interviews and introductions.

**Hypothesis 2**: They are uninterested in white males. Or they are less likely to follow up after introductions due to incentives to hire other people.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am primarily asking for comments on Hypothesis 2. My understanding is that the phone screen is largely intended to see the ""fit"" between the job requirements and the prospective's skills/goals.

* Does being a white male hinder me during the ""getting to know you stage""?  Any insider commentary on the role diversity incentives play in the hiring process?
* If not, do you have advice to increase turnover? Is there some common mistake I am making?
* If so, do you have any advice to navigate diversity incentives as a white male?

If you have 1000 features and 1 billion rows, how would you approach the problem in terms of reducing the number of features for creating Machine learning models? Also, we know what features mean, how many numerical and categorical features we have, etc. 

I answered the question as following-

1. First, we will find the distribution of classes in the response variable to determine whether we need to re-sample the data-set if it's a rare event problem
2. We can drop features which has more than 50% missing values.
3. We can drop categorical features if the occurrence of a class is below a threshold, let's say 20 in 1 million rows.
4. We can find correlation between features and drop features if they are highly correlated (He caught me here as it's not feasible to identify correlations from a correlation graph with 1000 features)
5. We can perform PCA on numerical features, select top K components which explains 95% variance, combine with categorical features and run machine learning models.

Then, he asked what if we want to explain which features were important in prediction as it won't be possible with PCA. I couldn't answer this part.

My GPA right now is suboptimal (3.2), and I want to raise it as much as possible before I graduate. But due to my low gpa, and other factors, I might not get into any school (or don't go at all) so I want to get the most out of my undergrad studies. There are some very interesting classes that I want to take like (2 of the following):

[Data Science and Analytics](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece498dsu/sp2018/administrivia/)

[Data Science and Engineering](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece398bd/fa2018/)  or

[Deep Learning](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2019/spring/CS/398)

but if I take these classes my GPA will most likely suffer. Or I could go the ""easy route"" and take an advanced R programming class and SAS programming class for my major. these classes seem easy enough but I don't think it will look good in my transcript based on course names.

There's a chance I won't even find a job that will use this kind of ML knowledge with only a Bachelors so maybe the easy route is better? Or maybe I'm overestimating the jump in gpa I could attain? any opinions are appreciated.

TLDR: easy route: raise gpa (maybe at most to 3.4?), possibility more free time to look for job, lose out on practical ML knowledge, more experience with R, Rcpp, SQL, SAS, doesn't look as good in grad app.

hard route: high chance of gpa hit, less free time, more python experience, have practical ML knowledge, wont learn SAS and other software, more prepared to tackle harder classes in grad school (maybe?)",0,1

We would like to use the machine for data crunching. Pulling in larger tables from data warehouses (Oracle, MSSQL, other sources, all over the network), potentially buffering/storing them in a local database system (Mariadb? No idea, haven't looked into the details here) but mainly do in memory calculations using python. Table size can vary, we have tables which need to be combined starting at 2 mio rows but also some with 120 mio or more, and worst case scenario is to run inner joins on 3 tables with 100 mio rows each plus do some more ""magic"" with dataframe manipulation/filtering.

Each generation has their own imagination of AI, Robotics, likes we saw in movies. But AI is designed in such a way, its more Intelligence than looking Artificial unlike movies. Its difficult to distinguish intelligence between natural and artificial, thats why a smooth transition is required for not looking artificial. Example Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Google where users not even realize they are using AI in general life. So, AI should not be programmed in such a way only to make machine seems like human intelligence but also to behave like human. This way AI will make machine our colleague not our rival. AI growth is exponentially now a day unlike last 60 years. All because of huge data generated, faster processing, large storage, various tools. So, tech-giants, market capitalist, bankers using AI using new AI application.

Machine learning is one of exciting and essential sub-part to AI, where machine use thousands of reasoning, experience data to analyze and build an algorithm to achieve the desired goal. As the experience grows machine becomes smarter over time. Thats how machine become more smarter and intelligence e.g. IBM Watson, Apple SIRI, Neural Network. Machine are not competitors but they are helping hands of human. Let machine do repetitive task where they are best and human do strategic and relation job where they are perfect.

**About the data:**  
\- mixed (categorical + numerical)  
\- features may be correlated

**What I've done so far:**  
\- In order to keep things simple for the moment, I've discretized the numerical features and am treating them just like a categorical features.  
\- I've started off with the simplest possible approach - [Attribute Value Frequency (AVF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4410382) algorithm.  
\- I'm getting some results (kind of), but the problem with AVF is that it does not cater for correlations between different features.

**What I'm thinking of doing:**  
\- The [apriori algorithm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori-Algorithmus) seems to be somewhat similar to what I need. But it is not meant for Outlier detection (low support regions) but for finding the mode of the distribution (high support regions).  
\- I was thinking of somehow using an 'inverse apriori algorithm' (if one exists) for my problem of outlier detection. After a quick search, I have noticed that people have indeed tried going in such directions.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTION:**   
\- Has anyone tried this approach before? If so, what is a good source that I can use.  
\- Are there any better approaches? (*NOTE:* I have almost no experience with outlier detection and therefore I might not know what I am doing)

Ive been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, Hey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they cant understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.

Anyway, Ive started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.

People got excited about this. SVPs were checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.

The only problem is theyre all wrong. We got the data and Ive been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesnt. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that we have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We cant just say theres nothing here worthwhile.

Im starting to feel like Im expected to manufacture results that simply arent real. I dont feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, Ive noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess Id say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect mewhether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. Its really stressing me out. Ive started drinking a lot more and its definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice? Is this common?",43,1

My career background: I trained as a research scientist where I first learnt to organise and analyse data with Matlab. I left academia with the aim to join industry and apply my data analysis skills during the time when data science was on the rise. 

Via free online courses, I learnt R programming and took opportunities to code on the job. I essentially bypassed the use of Excel to organise and analyse data by using R. I worked in retail for three years using R to wrangle large sets of data and built dashboards with Power BI. On occasion, I would perform some data science techniques  regression, prediction, clustering, sometimes with Python. 

I am currently working in banking and primary use SQL, R and Tableau to answer business questions. Ive been complimented on how I clearly present insights to senior stakeholders. Even though I know it doesnt take that much to impress, I do feel like I am adding value to the business.

I am a data analyst who gets to sit with the business (not with other analysts who must go through multiple managers to understand what the business wants and needs). I largely spend my time wrangling data and building dashboards. Whilst I am mostly happy, I want to turn my attention to the next thing in the same way I focused on R programming and some data science techniques years ago. This progressed my career beyond the world of Excel. 

Would love to get some opinions of what people believe I could focus on for the next year. Internet of things? AI? I cant see myself learning data science or AI techniques to become specialised in either. Rather, Ive enjoyed learning simple examples from such fields to showcase the potential benefits. I am not a specialist. I am a generalist that finally found a position where being a generalist is valued.

A bit of context first of all. I have just started this PhD program in Data Science and as I don't have an advisor yet (I have a few months to understand what I'm interested in and to choose one) and I haven't talked to anyone from the board yet (first meeting will be next week) I'm struggling to get started.

I'll have to take a few modules (I can choose among almost 70 different ones...). Given that data science itself is a broad field, there are many modules that I'm not interested in (regarding economics, biology, ethics...), but yet I don't know which I should choose. Right now I'm pretty much in the NLP field, and the plan for now would be to stick to that and eventually move to industry after the PhD. 

I have the chance to attend this module on cloud computing and big data. I've seen that knowledge about cloud computing is often required for many data science jobs, and I think it would be interesting to take it. What do you guys think about that? Is it really important as it seems?",4,1

However what I found is that the identically defined model (same number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, optimizer etc) when learned using Keras performed absolutely terribly (9%). I was able to get a model that worked through a significant reduction in the number of nodes per layer, but I was surprised that this was necessary.

Is anyone able to explain the reason for this? My guess is that there are implicit things that Keras does generating a difference between the two models but I am not sure. An initial guess would be that the Keras model is over fitting, but that doesn't feel intuitively right to me either as model accuracy is low on the train data as well as the test data.

I have a question I've been searching for quite a while but I have not found a solution yet, so I''d like to ask you for your help.

So, I'm currently working on a project (using R at the moment) that currently works the following way:
- Perform surveys regarding product variations;
- From the surveys, select the variations we'd like to analyze (these may vary in quantity in each analysis as we so desire);
- R scripts takes in the inputs and processes the structured data and spits out graphs (using data in long format, plotting with ggplot2 currently);
- Graphs are then manually edited on a Powerpoint file so that an image of the product corresponding to each variation is underneath its corresponding codename in the graph.

We're at a point that we'd like to automatize almost everything but the very last part I'm having tremendous difficulty with. I can write code to read the variables we choose, select the corresponding image file [most of them are same size] from the main directory, import it to R, but I cannot seem to place the images either replacing the x-axis ticks of the ggplot or just below it [preferred] - I found a blogpost regarding country flags and tried the code but ratio of the images was odd and non-intuitive to adjust, at least for me.

In a first stage I'd like to know if anyone could help me finding how to do this using R (get coordinates for each x-axis tick and somehow place the image underneath?) so I could add to my R Markdown file and Shiny app [in the words] (or Python, though I'm less proficient on that).

Secondly, to deploy this inside a web-browser autonomously, what would you recommend? Not too familiar with other tools, so I was thinking on deploying Shiny app inside the website but might run a bit slow, not sure. Open to suggestions for other languages such as js or similar, but then we'd have to hire someone for that.

Thanks!

PS: On mobile, so I cannot provide sample data unfortunately, but the structure is basically: ""user"", ""email"", ""product_code"", ""likert_scale"" (500-2000 rows for each file) at a time.",4,1

**Introduction**

The search for true artificial intelligence is the basis of the continuous development of cars without drivers. This is what you need to know about it.

What is true artificial intelligence? Whatever it is, experts and experts rush to clarify the fact that what we have at the moment is not.

To get to the point where we have a true artificial general intelligence, we are a long way off. We are not even close to that, and researchers in the AI area know, says Raveen Nao Intel.

Why are we so far? In short, building a true artificial general intelligence is very difficult because of one fundamental fact: intelligence is more than the recognition and the reaction of patterns. If there is only one image that represents intelligence, it is the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo.

**The paradox of intelligence**

The famous fresco The Creation of Adam shows God giving life to Adam, but the finger of God is not touching Adam (or Adams finger is not touching God, depending on how you look at it).

The level of logic and mystery and abstraction and actualization establishes the creation of Adam in the divine realms as profane both at the same time. Intelligence is the space between the finger of Adam and the finger of God. To ask, How do you make negative space mean anything? And the computer will certainly emit absurd; at least not produce an equivalent to the creation of response Adam. Go ahead, ask Siri.

When we try to create a true AI, we try to animate an artificial Adam, but for this to be possible, we need to create a paradox: a being capable of logical and illogical thinking at the same time. For abstraction and true intelligence to be possible, a mind must be able to withdraw from itself.

Autonomous cars are the most important and fundamental piece of the actual AI jigsaw puzzle that advances; The following will tell you why.

**Why cars without a driver matter**

In addition to being important to AI, cars without drivers are incredibly important for the future of driving and transportation:

* It could reduce the number of accidents by 90%, save lives and reduce the cost of medical care and auto repair.
* They could reduce emissions by 60%, which would help in the fight against climate change.
* They could free drivers to do other things, reduce stress, and catalyze productivity.

These are just some of the potential benefits of cars without a driver. There are others related such as improving the Internet of things and freeing up space in cities that have huge implications for how to build and manage our cities and infrastructure benefits.

**The problem for AI**

There is a big problem. This problem is not the only representative of the quest for true AI; it is the crux of the quest.

Should the AI be programmed without a driver to always comply with traffic laws? How does a car without a driver decide what to do when there is a choice between saving the person in the vehicle or saving a person out of the vehicle?

Heres a scenario: A car without a driver transports a passenger across a bridge hundreds of feet above the depth of the water.

Suddenly, a driver on the approaching track falls asleep and his car enters the wrong lane, heading straight for the car without a driver at high speed. Its late at night; the passenger in the car without a driver is also sleeping. If the computer woke the passenger and warned him, giving him the option to take control and make a decision, it would be too late and there would be a head-on collision.

What should the AI do? If you deviate to the wrong lane, you are breaking the law, and the other driver is likely to die because your impulse will send you to the railing. If you go ahead, kill the two people. If you stray from the road to the handrail, a collision could occur and could lead directly through the handrail and kill the passenger.

**Logic does not always apply to AI cars**

In this scenario, logical and algorithmic protocols do not seem to apply. Programming an AI to break the law goes against another programming, which is based on the law. If you encode an algorithm to break the law and release it with algorithms that respect the law, there is a possibility that the algorithms interact unexpectedly and unintentionally.

Even more: imagine that there is a human in the drivers seat, not knowing what to do when the car approaches. The human instinctively steps on the brakes. The approaching driver suddenly wakes up and has time to get back on track because the uncertainty of the other driver gave him time to make the correction.

You cannot program artificial intelligence to be uncertain, because the algorithms are if-this-then-that; It seems illogical to step on the brakes with a car coming toward you, so in this case, the single, uncertain brain of a human is an advantage.

**The IoT factor**

AI cars are naturally connected cars, they are part of IoT, which may be the most important development in the 21st century. It is estimated that there will be about 50 to 70 billion IoT devices in operation by 2020.

Heres the question: If cars without a driver could communicate with all the other cars on the road, if all cars had AI (even if they were not without a driver), it would seem that there would be no problem. One car could tell another to cancel a sleeping driver and stop.

However, IoT is vulnerable to attack. Cars can be mass-armed. But what if the cars had true generalized artificial intelligence? A car could have something like an immune system. He would know when he is attacking and initiate defence protocols.

**AI will win once he solves the paradox**

Driving presents the AI with a problem, that if it can find the solution, it will be smarter than the humans. Lets say that for the car, it is always logical to make the right decision. So the right decision is logical. If you are an AI, how do you make an illogical decision that is correct, and therefore logical?

Great art like The creation of Adam has nothing to do with logic, it is not logical to think that a being who defies the laws of physics has turned nothing into something and created people who are bound by the laws of physics. However, the abstract and metaphorical thinking necessary for religion and art has created a language system that has allowed humans to thrive, so this kind of thinking has its own logic.

We may never be able to make AI think that way, but at least we are learning a lot about ourselves through effort.

**Background:**

I have a masters in pure mathematics from a highly ranked UK university. I did almost no programming at university and a little statistics. The focus of my masters was topology, manifolds, Lie groups etc, if that means anything to anyone here :) Of course I have studied Linear Algebra in depth and am really enjoying learning the statistics that is new to me. Since graduating I have been teaching mathematics at High School level in International Schools around the globe for the past 6 years. But now I am looking to try something new.

**Study so far:**

For the past 2 years I have been studying Computer Science topics and programming. I have taken Database Management Systems (MySQL) and Intermediate Software Design in Python through Foothill College online. Then I have done various MOOCs including CS50 and Stanford Algorithms. I am almost finished with ""Python For Data Science And Machine Learning"" on udemy and have really enjoyed it. It doesn't go into the mathematics, so at the same time I've been reading ISLR. I'm then going to go through ISLR once again but doing the exercises in R. I'm looking forward to then moving onto The Elements of Statistical Learning to really get into the details of the mathematics. I'm also picking up a lot more books when I'm home for winter break that I'm going to sink myself into :D

I have come to the conclusion that a career in Data Science is going to combine my love of mathematics, data, programming etc into one I will really enjoy and (hopefully) be good at.

**Personal situation:**

I will be working full time (studying in spare time) until June 2019. Then I am in the lucky position of being able to stay at home, whilst my (very supportive) partner works another year until June 2020. I will be both studying and being a parent (with childcare). I live in a developing country with few options for local experience in the field (though I need to research this further). The plan is then to move to my partners home city (Seattle) in the summer of 2020 and for me to find a job :)

**Options for the next year and a half:**

So I am currently weighing up my options for the next year and a half before we move around the globe. I have looked at some data science bootcamps and I could do similar stuff on my own: building up a portfolio, writing a blog, contributing to open source software, entering kaggle comps, building personal projects etc. The great thing is I will be able to go much more in-depth with the topics compared to a bootcamp as I'll have so much more time. The downside is I will not have the career guidance, interview prep, help with LinkedIn etc.

Another option I am looking at is starting the Georgia Tech OMS Analytics Masters. I do like the structured learning of a full university course and the course descriptions [sound really interesting](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics?section=curriculum). It does sound like it would be a real challenge to finish in a year and I think I would only be able to start Fall 2019.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'd appreciate any feedback, ideas, words of encouragement, thoughts on my situation.

I'm looking forward to then moving onto The Elements of Statistical Learning to really get into the details of the mathematics. I'm also picking up a lot more books when I'm home for winter break that I'm going to sink myself into :D

I have come to the conclusion that a career in Data Science is going to combine my love of mathematics, data, programming etc into one I will really enjoy and (hopefully) be good at.

**Personal situation:**

I will be working full time (studying in spare time) until June 2019. Then I am in the lucky position of being able to stay at home, whilst my (very supportive) partner works another year until June 2020. I will be both studying and being a parent (with childcare). I live in a developing country with few options for local experience in the field (though I need to research this further). The plan is then to move to my partners home city (Seattle) in the summer of 2020 and for me to find a job :)

**Options for the next year and a half:**

So I am currently weighing up my options for the next year and a half before we move around the globe. I have looked at some data science bootcamps and I could do similar stuff on my own: building up a portfolio, writing a blog, contributing to open source software, entering kaggle comps, building personal projects etc. The great thing is I will be able to go much more in-depth with the topics compared to a bootcamp as I'll have so much more time. The downside is I will not have the career guidance, interview prep, help with LinkedIn etc.

Another option I am looking at is starting the Georgia Tech OMS Analytics Masters. I do like the structured learning of a full university course and the course descriptions [sound really interesting](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics?section=curriculum). It does sound like it would be a real challenge to finish in a year and I think I would only be able to start Fall 2019.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'd appreciate any feedback, ideas, words of encouragement, thoughts on my situation.

**TLDR: Mathematics background transitioning to data science. Has a year and a half (with one year of full-time study, portfolio work, maybe masters) until move to the US and trying to change to a career in Data Science. Advice?**",9,1

Currently i am training a model and evaluating it with the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
Now, i am running into some problems with this. 
What i want to do is get the lowest MAPE. 

One problem is as follows. 
When the MSE is going down, the MAPE might oscillate within a magnitude of 10^3 . 
Now one would think: why not just use the MAPE loss function, if the a lowest MAPE is the goal?

This will bring up the second problem. 
For some reason using MAPE as a loss function is not working out for me at all. 
I'm using Keras and am working with a LSTM model, but that shouldn't matter i guess.
When using the MAPE as a loss function, i am getting values of like 60.000 %.... While using MSE as a loss function the best values i get are ~60%...

How should one tackle this problem and/or what is going wrong?
I'm having the feeling that this either is some basic question, or a theory problem. 
That's the reason i'm not posting any code right now.

**Introduction**

Understanding the role of mass data when building an ad network is an essential step in having the most successful marketing and advertising possible.

Ad networks have become much more reliant on big data than ever before. A 2017 Entrepreneur article titled How Big Data is Solving Big Advertiser Problems, attempted to address these challenges.

Andrew Medal, the author of the article and founder of Agent Beta, said the big date is vital to creating personalized campaigns and improving customer orientation. To offer these solutions to advertisers, they need to develop a clear understanding of the customers footprint. This involves following clients individually as well as making observations about the customer based on similar demographic and behavioural factors. For example, ad networks recognize that its important to see how customers who search for different keywords on Google behave.

This allows ad networks to refine their targeting capabilities and deliver more subtle information to their customers. Understanding the role of big data in creating an ad network is very important.

**Big Data is more important than ever for new ad networks**

Selecting the right channel for promotion is the key to a companys success. With the variety of ad types, companies face the difficulties of choice and do not always recover the result of the expected advertising campaign. Traditional advertising is losing its power and is not as effective as before. A recent Facebook case has shown that social networks are not completely honest with advertisers and that they hide inflatable ad metrics. According to ADOTAS research, 86% of consumers suffer from blindness to banners, a phenomenon when site visitors ignore ads. As a result, companies are spending money on useless ads and are not reaching the target audience. To solve the problem, many advertisers have switched to ad networks.

**What is an advertising network?**

An ad network is an online platform that connects potential advertisers, publishers, brands and customers so that the first ones reach the target audience on a network. These networks have been in the market for some time and have evolved over time into a complete ecosystem that not only gives businesses the ability to configure their ads correctly but also provides ordinary users with useful ads.

**Creating your own ad network**

With the increasing demand for this type of advertising, the number of networks grew. The market today has many brilliant examples that really give companies a CTR rate of 7-8%, which is quite high, compared to traditional banners (0.1-1%). Networks like Pop Slide, Easy Visual, or Cash Tree have already introduced their products to the global audience and bring together millions of people in a single system.

We asked a founder of the Easy Visual advertising network, Rafal Szymanski, to share his views on the future of advertising networks:

Advertising networks are changing the way we see ads. People spend more and more time online, which means they will probably reach their prospects through a smartphone or tablet that users unlock 80 to 110 times per day rather than putting banners on the street. These networks give companies the ability to target their ads according to users personal characteristics, which translates into actual views, relevant ads, and allows the brand to reach only customers at Easy Visual, weve created an app that spans a number of markets, including the US, Russia, Ukraine, South Korea, Poland, Germany, etc. and provides statistics on views and ad conversion rates. This network will be useful for various areas of the market and also serves as a source of traffic for mobile applications and services.

It is not so difficult to create your own advertising network, but you should consider the competition that is present in the market. 3 simple rules that any newcomer should follow in the advertising market:

**1. Analyse the market.**

Do not rush to Educate carefully and accurately the market and competitors, see what solutions have already been introduced and what opportunities are not yet being implemented.

**2.Attract the audience of future clients.**

When creating your own network, you should already have a user base that will result in potential customers for brands and companies. Customers will not use the network where they do not have people to serve their ads.

**3.Define potential customers between companies.**

Cosmetics, clothing, applications, electronic devices, the variety is infinite. Choose the right direction of the market that you can promote in your network.

**Do not ignore the importance of Big Data when creating an ad network**

When creating an ad network, youll need to incorporate machine learning, predictive analytics, and other Big Data solutions for your products. Keep this in mind and optimize your network accordingly.

I've been tasked to improve the accuracy of my call center's call volumes from now on. The current method is basic ""guestimating"" using historical data and excel spreadsheets. This however impacts the accuracy down the line need for capacity and scheduling.

I heard that using either: triple exponential smoothing, ARIMA or multiple temporal aggregation will be great for this. As far as I know, Excel struggles with this. Therefore I decided R will be my best solution. I've done a few experiments and I'm able to create graphs using R's time series analysis. I'd like to export my results as a csv for further use though.

Is there a way to do this? Am I going about this the right way? I've tried other techniques (trends, regression, etc) but it's an emergency call center so it's hard to predict. I also thought about using simulation software, but again the variables (per 15 mins) become to complex.",5,1

I did the free descritive statistics course on udacity and i am reading ""naked statistics"", i also did politics science as my first graduation before a started work at the bank and i really like statistcs applied to politics at the time so i think i am on the right track to a carreer that i enjoy.

I am considering doing the Udacity data science courses since i have the money. At the time i studied something like 3 hours every day (and then i play overwach with friends for 2 hours). I am having my first child at January and time could start being a problem, but i will cut down overwacht first :(

I'll give a quick summary of where I came from, where I am, and where I'm going for context:

BS in Risk Analysis (IT/Stats type hybrid) in '10, since then I've worked in the US intel community doing all kinds of fun stuff, used my background to help pioneer some pretty cool data innovations for one of the big three letter agencies. I consider myself more a intel analyst/data analyst combo, but my job title has been 'Data Scientist' on a number of occasions, enough that I'm known as a Data Scientist in the USIC (again, non-tech people assigning titles here). I'm half way through my MS in Data Science from a well known university. I'm also looking to transition out of DC to a smaller town (Philly area), and as such would probably leave my roll in the USIC where I have built quite a good reputation....

Jumping back into the job market has been a bit of a shock, and I attribute this mostly to the complete lack of awareness surrounding the definition of 'Data Science'. For every 10 job postings for Data Scientists that I've looked at, I feel like everyone is a completely different job and covers such a wide set of skills that I feel woefully underprepared for any of them. 

I have a good grasp on statistics, I can code/know R/Python/VB/SAS/SQL (although I wouldn't consider myself 'coder fluent', I can figure out anything, it just takes time and some SO/google-fu), I'm a capable business person (I've briefed to high level stakeholders, can communicate and write well, etc...), my critical thinking/data munging/manipulation I would class as 'expert'. So at the core, I feel like a competent 'true data scientist'...

So this is where my question really begins - 

We've all seen some version of the [DS venn-diagram](http://www.prooffreader.com/2016/09/battle-of-data-science-venn-diagrams.html)...and thats all fine and dandy, but I dont think that accurately represents what companies want in a DS. So what skills do I need to work on to be that more complete package, and how do I go about learning the skills? 

**TL;DR: For someone who already has stat/coding/domain knowledge - what are the full life cycle DS processes that one would also have to be fluent in, or at least have a strong grasp of - especially in a full stack perspective - and subsequently what are the best ways to learn them.**

The boss seems to like me. They make money by having investors support them as long as they produce good returns on their service.

The firm is currently supporting a nonprofit charity and is advertising to find donors for the charity. The amount of money the firm raises for the charity, and the firm's satisfaction ratings from the charity are the metrics investors are using to decide how much support to provide.

I just graduated with a B.S. in mathematics with probability and experimental design courses in Statistics. If I'm given the job, the Salary will be $30000-$35000 a year.

Can you help me brainstorm what sort of analysis I can do to find trends to improve satisfaction rating, receive more money from investors and generate more revenue for the charity?

1) look at the categorical and quantitative features of the investors to see which features and interests are associated with more funding and continued funding. Figure out the potential for investment based off investor net worth and contributing factors.

2) Figure out what other areas the investor would like to support. Find out metrics that return the most benefit to the firm's investors.

3) would I use surveys to gather this data along with individual research?

4) Identify potential investors with similar traits to  current investors.

5) Examine demographic data the charity collects to identify target audiences

6) Create surveys figuring out what contributes to satisfaction rating

7) Perform an analysis like a split plot to determine what advertising methods work the best with which demographics

8) Do a cost/return analysis of various advertising methods.

9) Have the sales team members keep short logs of how they interacted with potential donors to see which metrics have the greatest effect on donation amount relative to the theoretical amount that donor could afford and/or relative to the median/average donation, and use this to inform the Boss to make decisions in Sales training off his instinct/experience/this data.

I'm helping develop the final capstone course/project for a data science MOOC and I was hoping to bounce some ideas or get some suggestions from this community. On a very basic level, we want learners to develop a machine learning algorithm and a product (GitHub page, Rmd, slide deck) that can be showcased.

If you've done a capstone course/project, what did you like or not like about it? If you haven't done one, what kind of projects, features, or support would you like to see provided?

Here are some things the team has been debating:

* Should the project be assigned (How many options?) or should learners have the freedom to pick their own dataset and project? Do we provide a dataset and let learners answer their own question from there?
   * If we assign a training dataset or project, we would have a testing set and grading could be easier.
* Should there be weekly goals/milestones or just a final submission at the end of the course (2-4 weeks) without any kind of guidance/structure?
   * If a dataset or project is assigned, it would be easier to have the same milestone or quiz on the data for everyone.
* How do we grade the project (and smaller milestones, if any)? Does everyone get peer graded? Do only paid certificate learners get graded by teaching assistants/the instructor?
* How and what do learners submit? Do learners submit a Rmd or csv file or a GitHub link?

**Introduction**

The fashion industry benefits from the big date in an important way. See how data and technology come together to make customers more stylish.

Many of the readers are not in the fashion industry. However, those involved in the Big Data industry should note the $ 2.4 billion fashion industry; an industry that has experienced an annual growth rate of 5.5-7% in the last decade. Big Data is tapping into aspects of the industry that go from design to resale. In addition, most people in the world connect with fashion on one level or another and with styles that fit their individual expressions.

Among the real estate, construction and manufacturing industries, the retail industry has historically been the slowest in adopting technological advances. It was Amazon who entered the game and began to make great strides employing such things as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Even the older brands began to pay attention to Amazons disruption.

Countless industries have jumped to the Big Data band for years and the fashion industry is the last to do it as well. Big Datas compatibility with the fashion industry is based on three key aspects: extremely high data volumes, reliability and variety. The greater the volume of data generated, the greater the quality of data assimilated by Big Data technology.

**The failures in traditional retail analysis**

Fashion houses and traditional brands collect crucial data, such as inventory details and sales records; they were strictly kept in the company. This devotion to the dark caused those working in the industry to do so in a proverbial silo, which made many of the colours, styles, settings, and other design metrics become scattered and unstructured data. In addition, the industry had no crucial pieces of the puzzle, such as competitive analysis, prospects, trends, prices and other vital details.

**Big Data and Fashion Quality Control**

Pattern recognition \[1\] (not to be confused with image recognition) is a subset of artificial intelligence. Combined with Big Data, pattern recognition is being used by companies to protect the integrity of their brands. The integrity of the brand is not only maintained through quality control but also through the struggle to prevent counterfeiters from spreading the replicas fashion.

In 2017, the Office of the United States Trade Representative published its Annual List of Notary Markets in which it stated: Imports of counterfeit and pirated physical products are estimated at about half a billion dollars or about 2.5 per cent global imports . New technology companies are approaching to solve a problem that has affected the fashion industry for generations: counterfeit goods and pirated goods.

From fake Rolex watches to replicas of Gucci clothing, as well as anything and everything in between can be found at online retail giants like eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. Kim Smith, a content marketer at Good Firms, a software research and analysis platform, said, Fake has been around for a long time, but with the latest technology available and small details that can be replicated, its on the rise. Anything can be fake, from luxury products to businesses and consumers, to videos and audio .

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that approximately 10% of medical products sold in underdeveloped or developing countries are counterfeit and of poor quality. Some experts believe the percentage is much higher. And while it is difficult to measure the exact impact, a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh and commissioned by the WHO has found that counterfeit or substandard medicines are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year.

**Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and New Fashion Trends.**

Finally, the fashion industry, like many other industries, has faced the possibility that machine learning and artificial intelligence replace human designers. And while artificial intelligence robots have not yet taken the place of Giorgio Armani, technologies like IBM Cognitive Prints are helping designers with their new ideas.

Priyanka Agrawal, an IBM Research India researcher, said in an interview: Fashion designers are working hard to create new designs that can create trends.

In addition, they have inspirations like architecture or technology, which they intend to translate into their work. However, it is increasingly difficult to do something new and interesting; we wanted to make it easier for them to increase the design life cycle.

The context is that I've been working for about a year out of college in a small analytics startup, and I'm applying for postgraduate studies for either next year or the year after. My core interest has always been urban planning and architecture: I dropped out of architecture school and went to CS because I hated how design decisions were made without any awareness of evidence as to what works for users. I'm considering going back to school for an urban planning program with a strong design focus, but in a school that has a strong tech community, and I intend to continue working on all my projects from a data angle. 

The place I'm working has a really lean team, by which I mean I'm the only guy who knows what's really needed to run the tech side of things besides my project manager, who isn't as involved in the product design. The senior data scientist has experience, but none of it has been in working in a production environment, and faced with the task of setting up a proper CI pipepine here he's shown very little interest, and I've had to deal with it alongside vendors and my project manager. Meanwhile, the actual ML side has been very ad-hoc, practically pre-sales engineering where we slap shit together to try to close deals even before we're done building the final product platform. Move fast, break things still requires some manpower and organisation...

Consequently I'm learning a lot about setting up infrastructure in a scalable way, consulting contractors, ex-bosses, and colleagues from past internships and going to tech meetups which are thankfully very numerous in my city. But I worry that going to a non-quantitative postgraduate course would dilute my credos as a technical guy. I want to spend more time than I'm able to looking at tools like Hyperopt and getting more experience actually bringing business-critical data projects through the whole process of ETL, modeling, crossvalidation and so forth, but half the time I'm tied up with infrastructure development and testing while my senior data scientist spends three weeks in a row fiddling with hyperparameters for a single client that he's manually tuning and tracking in Notepad. Once I'm confident in setting shit up for production I want to go somewhere where I can focus on ML use cases, ideally actually related to urban problems... But I'm worried that getting a non-STEM postgrad would hurt my career.

I could attempt to do the same by going to a CS or math program and angling my projects from an urban perspective... but I think the outcome would be quite different. I'd love to work with places that deal with urban use cases like Sidewalk Labs or the Geo team, but I'd love to work at tech shops that have to figure out what's happening and what to do with communities that have some kind of direction, like Discord as opposed to Facebook. Going all the way back however, my original goal was to find a way to shake things up in the big engineering and design firms like Arup, Mott Macdonald; urban planning and design consultancies including government offices, and even architecture firms. The plan was always to be credible by accomplishing stuff in data science before trying to enter that industry, but even with that there's also a lot of resistance to outside suggestions if you're not a professional in that sphere, like an engineer, architect, or urban planning. So a postgrad in that area seems important to some degree.

I guess I'm looking for some insight and opinions on what you think the best way to look at this conundrum is. How bad does it look if it all doesn't pan out and I stay in STEM jobs at STEM companies? If I'm not working in urban planning and design, I don't have much patience for non-tech companies, tried that schtick in bulge bracket and hated being a second-class citizen in the company ecosystem. Diving into ML research on a STEM masters would be self-indulgence, I'd love to do it but it keeps me away from my goals... What would you do?",3,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old, almost 27. Got a bachelors in physics from local university in South America and luckily got into an applied physics masters in an ivy league school. Struggled, but graduated with a GPA that can go on a resume. Then, decided physics was not for me and learned about data science through MOOCs. Got my first job in an early stage startup in my home country after 4 months of study (my scholarship didn't allow me to stay in the US). Got frustrated with the lack of guidance (just two technical people: a software engineer and I) and changed to a big consulting company after 7 months. Worked there for 6 months. Lot's of politics, questionable practices and unprofessional coworkers. The technical people were..  weak and I felt like I was the most senior person that could be called DS there (not my merit, but company's demerit). So I quit and joined a second 1 year master's program (CS with DS focus), in Europe (which has affordable education). One semester of courses later I got an internship that was partnership between university's lab an tech company. In the company no one had a clue about ML and the lab professor was nice, but not able to do much outside his ML math (example: in the first week he told me I could use his C implementation of MLP for my text classification task).

&amp;#x200B;

During and after my internship I applied to lots of jobs. Got countless rejections and 3 offers. 2 big tech companies and a startup where the only DS was leaving. I chose the one that seemed best, one of the big ones which seemed to have a fair amount of other DS. I started this week and I was able to see some code from my peers and.. wasn't really what I expected. Some questionable methodologies from both machine learning and software engineering angles. Yesterday my boss made it clear in a meeting that he thinks GloVe is an library with a word2vec implementation. The overall vibe of the office is also unpleasant to me and there are some other personal stuff that makes it harder (everyone I care about, including gf is 7000 km away from me or more).

&amp;#x200B;

This will sound weird, but I miss having a reason to feel the impostor syndrome. When I was studying physics, there was always people so much smarter than I was, from which I could learn and hope to be as good one day. And now for years I feel surrounded by not so competent people. And this is not because all smart brains are in physics and dumb people go to DS, but because only the ""dumb"" ones offered me jobs. I'm sure there are a lot of DS 3 years younger than me who make more money than I do in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad software engineering skills. I have never really studied classic algorithms. I mean, I wouldn't be able to pass a software engineer whiteboard interview. I never really used SQL in real world. In all my experiences I had csv or json files.  I can do some queries after doing some hacker rank, reading w3 schools and transferring knowledge from R or Pandas. I can't put a model in production. I never used AB testing. Most of what I did was similar to Kaggle competitions or Kernels with some additional steps before and after. I know the real basics of pyspark, but again never had to use in real life. I think I am very good at problem solving with machine learning, I have a good practical and theoretical understanding of ML, I could spot issues in most ML problems I saw in the past and I did well in many ML competitions.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm stuck in a local minima. I cannot get jobs where I'll work with smart people cause I'm not that good, but I cannot get better because some things are just tough to learn by yourself. I've tried to give ""momentum"" by studying by myself, but it only helped until a certain point. I'm far from everyone I care about, with an idea that in Europe things would be better career-wise, but I didn't land the job that would fulfill me in that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not dumb. I achieved many things most wouldn't. Everyone I worked was very happy with my work. But I am stuck. I'm afraid to have another 6 months of less experience in my resume and that no one will hire me because I don't stick around. I feel like quitting my current job and this is my first week. I'm afraid in a few months I will have more time experience, but less value to time ratio (""so you have 3 years of experience as DS but can't put a model in production, don't know about a/b testing, no real experience with analytics, don't know shit about spark, hadoop, docker and all those technologies that sound like pokemon names? Sounds like a junior""). I consider applying to jobs back in my home country where competition seems to be less and I may have more chance in good teams. I really don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some details of my failed interviews:

Most application processes start with a take home task to do some EDA or maybe ML. I passed all of them, but then in the interview I sucked and got rejected. In one company (#1 in their area, where data science is core) they said my task was one of the strongest they had ever seen, but still my answers in the interview were vague (this one was more data science analytics). I agree with them, as I had no experience with a/b testing (important for them), had only heard about multi armed bandits and couldn't answer well what the distribution of revenue per user should look like. In another one, again I passed the task and in the technical interview I was able to answer questions related to the tech around a ML model in production. The feedback was I was too junior (although this was literally a 'data scientist junior' position and I had previous experience). For another one I passed the first technical interview after the task, and got rejected in the last one after a lot of questions related to optimizing delivery algorithms. For another one they wanted someone either with better software engineering or deep learning skills. For 2, I failed classic coding tests. For 3, of them I got rejected after apparently passing all technical. For many I didn't even get interviews.

I will keep this as short and simple as possible: I am a junior (junior age wise, little behind in credits) studying Statistics and CS at a large state school with a decent program in both. 

I am actively looking for an internship for the summer in the data/software area (data analyst, data science, software dev/engineer, etc.) to gain experience, since my resume is pretty weak (one data entry ""internship"", no side-projects (WIP), customer service jobs, no clubs). I have applied to 30+ places and have gotten denied at about 10 so far. I am applying to a ton more to this day and will through the winter/spring.

I have heard back from a ""Data Science internship"" which is ""unpaid/for credit"". It is with my state's major league soccer team. I feel I am relatively qualified  (pretty familiar with R/Python when ""some experience"" is a requirement). They want to set up a phone interview soon.

I guess I am posting because I don't know if I should be careful since it is unpaid. I've heard very negative things from a lot of people about unpaid internships in this field. However, I am not too confident I will find anything better, and I really want to gain actual experience. I work a part time serving job and a campus job so I should have some kind of income for the summer. If I did end up getting offered a position, what can I expect? Is it worth it? Does anyone have any experience in these kind of situations? Any feedback is super helpful and I appreciate it.

**Note:** I posted in this sub because I wanted input from people in the actual field. If it would be better to post in r/jobs or a CS sub I will do so. Thank you!

Hey, I'm not really in the big data or data science world but a requirement of a mobile application I'm building is to see live stats from users. These starts are not generated a lot really, only on user register, on game start, game end.  At first I was doing Kafka + Hadoop (HDFS) + Spark but this was pretty complicated. 

I'm starting to reach my deadline for this task and kind of getting desperate. I wanted to send events to Kafka and have consumers just push them to S3 in Avro file format for long term storage as well also sending it to a Time Series Database (InfluxDB) for querying from Garfana. However, even with just trying to get my Kafka consumers to work is being difficult. I'm wondering if I can just send my events directly to my time series database and periodically backup my data to S3 via that DBs backup tool and cronjob. Essentially removing the Kafka buffer. I can monitor the system and see how it's performing so I know how urgently I need to iterate to phase 2 with a more robust system.

All I really notice thus far are patterns that I've heard about before, temporary alignments that come and go. My idea was to use machine learning somehow, but I feel like that's about as far-fetched as any other indicator.

I guess I was looking for certainty, but that I figure is also nearly impossible if not completely impossible. Just looking for some people who may have an idea or two about how to use data science to do some prediction on the financial data.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Msc. in Economics with a strong focus in econometrics and I have been working as a research-assistant for the past two years.  This means I have good skills in econometric modelling and data analysis, good knowledge of Stata and an intermediate knowledge of MATLAB and R. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over time I discovered that waht I really like about the research process is the statistical/data analysis side of it and so I have decided to make a transition to a Data Science career. That being said I would like to ask for some advice as to what  is the most efficient way to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

What should be my next steps? What skills should I acquire so that employers see me as a capable Data Scientist and not just an Economist?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply to Data Analyst jobs while I acquire the skills needed to make the transition to Data Science? Or should I focus directly in Data Science and start with some internships if necessary?

It is my experience that seemingly simple analysis requests (stuff like we noticed a change in X in markets M1 and M2 after we introduced Y, is it a good idea to implement Y in all remaining markets?) will devolve quickly. Questions get changed, scopes increase mid-analysis, the analysis answers completely different questions, the requesters themselves dont know what they need to see in order to be convinced of anything, fellow analysts and superior will tell you to change things but yet explain why it makes sense. I normally end up asking a lot of questions that people ignore or hand-wave away and then get stuck because nothing is clear anymore.

Im doing a poor job at explaining this because its still nebulous in my head.

I am at the point in my life where I have to make the decision between heading for a masters degree vs getting a job. There are of course many factors affecting such a decision but I purely want to focus with this post on the straight forward advantage a masters could provide over simply working in the data science/engineering field and vice versa.  
Just as a heads up, after the first question, I will use data science as short form of saying data science/data engineering.  


1. What is the difference between data science/ data engineering in simple terms, and what does my current student job(mentioned below) qualify as?  

2. Is pursuing a masters degree in data science better than finding an entry level job with a bachelors degree in the same field given my current education? To build further, is knowledge in data science more important than experience in the field?  

3. Are my current qualifications enough to start a serious data science job?  

4. This is more of a regional question, but I didn't seem to find many job offerings with the title 'data scientist'. What other job titles are used that imply a data scientist generally,but especially in Europe/Germany?

Below is general information about me as to help with your advice!

* Educational Background:

I am an international living in Germany who's almost done with his bachelors in Information Engineering(Mixture of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering). I have quite the programming knowledge in Python, SQL, R, Java, C++, C; all at an intermediate - expert level.

*   
Working Experience:

While studying I had mainly 2 student jobs. The first one lasting a year was in mailing server development for various customers (did it just for the money at that point).   
The second and most important job is the one I am doing currently for the last 2 years which is working at a semiconductor company in R&amp;D where I develop tools based on Spotfire(templates) to automate data analysis of large chunks of data so that the R&amp;D can make their decisions. It only recently came to my attention that what I am doing could be considered data science(engineering?) and where I learned my fair share of python and R and got comfortable with both of them(I have a strong programming background so learning languages was never an issue for me). In this job I also developed by software designing skills where questions like efficiency of implementations and optimizations come up a lot.

ImageNet is an image dataset which contains more than 14 million images of more than 1000 classes. Neural networks trained on this data are extremely good at extracting all kinds of useful features from the images. So I would take such a network, remove its softmax layer and build my own much simpler network on the top of it to get the predictions. This way I would save days of training which I would need to train a convolutional network from scratch.

Still, using only one ImageNet pre-trained neural network appeared to be not enough to achieve the required performance, so I ended up using three networks of different architectures: ResNet50, Inception and Xception.

The resulting architecture looked like this: 

https://i.redd.it/x2946oxwuiy11.png

During training I divided the network in two parts to reduce time consumption: first I extracted and stored the features using each pretrained network and then used the stored features as an input to the trainable part of the network. As a regularization to improve performance on the test set I used two dropout layers.

Resulting performance I achieved was 85% on the test set. Investigation into incorrect predictions showed that in some cases more than one dog or humans were present in the image or a dog was partially obscured by other objects. These as well as the cases where a dog was difficult to distinguish from the background my network couldnt deal with.

The network was implemented in Python using Keras framework with Tensorflow backend.",0,1

As you may guess from the title, I'm deep in the data science interview process and just got a confidence-crushing rejection.   


As such, I'm wondering if you all have insight into ""Attrition"" of the interview process. For the purposes of this question, I think its best to condition the problem by only considering applicants who got called back. The rate of resume application to call back is so variable and usually such a crap shoot if you apply online that I don't see it as useful.   


I'm also assuming a standard interview structure of:  
(i) Phone screen, usually with HR

(ii) Technical Screen, usually with Data Scientists  
(iii) on-site interview  
(iv) Offer  


So, what do you think is the fraction of applicants who get a phone screen to those who get a technical interview (e.g. 50% of phone screened applicants get a technical screen)? What fraction of technical screens get an on-site? And what fraction of on-sites get an offer?   


Currently, I'm pretty good at (i) -&gt; (ii) with only 1 out of 7 that didn't invite me to the next. But with technical screens I'm 1 for 3 with more pending. I haven't gone to my on-site yet.

A  very flexible approach to tackle this problems is to use splines and let  them figure out the form of the relationship. For illustration  purposes, we simulate some data with the **mgcv** package, which is also used in **brms** to prepare smooth terms.

&amp;#x200B;

HE talks about   multilevel data. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:  what are multilevel datas?  Could you please  make any concrete example?  

&amp;#x200B;

Also:  he talks  about  a smooth terms:  what re they used for?

546,2018-11-16,2018,11,16,13,9xiue7,Looking for resources on using clustering outputs as input to a classifier,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9xiue7/looking_for_resources_on_using_clustering_outputs/,thankyoujam,1542342401,"Hi all,

Have seen a few projects that use this approach, particularly for text classification. The idea is to 1) group similar text documents together (using e.g. levenshtein distance or word2vec embedding distance thresholds) to determine text document clusters. Then, 2) use the cluster identifier as a feature for a classifier to predict membership in some other class of interest.

There are some clear pitfalls to this - 

1. How do you determine a cluster id for a document that you've never seen before?
2. Do you run clustering once for your training set, once for test set? But then you have the same problem as 1) above where you can't determine groups for new documents.

So my question is - are there any academic treatments of this approach and the various problems that come up? Or some useful blog posts? Looking for theoretic foundations of the problems here - perhaps some ways forward!

I am currently at a crosscroads. I have finished my Masters in physics and was offered a PhD position on the physics of mobility. It is mostly theoretical research on how people migrate, and how certain transport modes (taxis, trains ride-sharing) behave at different scales. It involves a lot of simulations, and some data analysis, although nothing like deep learning.

Now my short-term goal is to contribute to science, in general, having some form of impact on society.

My long-term goal however is to ""not starve"", and not to jump from post doc to post doc, never really sure whether I will be sent to get another position. So I want to enter Data Science after my PhD. My question to you is how possible it is , with a niche field such as mobility physics. 

Is it okay to take the PhD position, or should I rather hope to get accepted for a PhD in a field like machine learning? Which is much less likely for me.

I'll laugh if the diagnostic test crashes my PC. Sorry for the format or misspellings in advance, I just want it to be done.

 Basically I'm going to start applying for jobs on data analysis, and I need insight on whether what I'm preparing myself with is useful or not. Some information about myself. I'm 23 and a night time college student doing a BSc CIS. Recently I just finished a course on SQL, and found the whole design and visualization of data to be super fun and interesting. So much so that I've decided that this is something I want to pursue. Work experience was a part time job fixing and selling computers, been doing this for about a year now, and found it really boring since every thing that was damaged was the same 4 things, specially RAM. Left it about a month ago, and with my free time I've been finding more about the data analysis profession. 

Now then, I'll List what I've been doing with my free time to prepare for the job, this will have things that I think are needed and those that I think would be fun to have some knowledge of. Afterwards, ill link and paste the description of 1 job listing that I feel has the most things in common with the rest job listings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things that I've been teaching myself are:

\-Statistics

\-SQL and Excel (I did take courses on these two but it was to general)

\-Power BI

\-Classification: Decision Trees and Model Evaluations 

\-Starting this today. I'm looking to run some linear regressions to see the relationship between advertising costs and their expenditure. 

\-I've lined up to learn Six sigma and their methodologies. But I'm not sure if it worth learning this yet.

\-Intermediate knowledge on Visual C# and basics of Java.

\-Down the line I'll look into R or Phyton.

\-I've seen VMware pop up in some job listing so I have it on the list of things to know about.

\-Hadoop analytics and Hbase (saw some listing that had these and I want to know if they're needed)

&amp;#x200B;

And that's about it, on things I'm doing. I saw somewhere some predictive analysis on determining the infected outburst of diseases, and I thought a similar project could be fun to better understand the spread of diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

The Insight I'm looking for is into what preparations I should be focusing on for a job as a data analyst.

The chats are classified into 2: resolved/ unresolved sessions (66.6% and 33.3% of the distribution respectively).

Based on this data I am building a model that would predict the resolution for each chat once it ends.

So far I tried using sklearn.svm.**SVC** with the following measurements as features:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the entire sessions (512 dim vector)
2. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the first question asked by the user (512 dim vector)
3. The length of the session - min\_max normalised
4. average message length of customer - min\_max normalised
5. average message length of technician - min\_max normalised
6. The overall number of interactions throughout the session - min\_max normalised

Additionally, as the SKlearn library is rather slow I am only using a portion of my data (\~30K samples)

So far results have been bad - all the predictions (100%) are of the bigger resolved classification.

What can I do to improve this model?

Maybe I need to use a different tool?

I just reached the final exam in thi course, and have a question about it.

If you did it, can you tell me if the challenges are based only on the videos of the courses, or if they also cover the final labs?

In case anyone is wondering, my question is because the final labs cover knowledge that is not presented in the course, and are incredible more complex than anything else there.

Honestly I'm appaled by the  course. It is basically the same content that Datacamp offers (It is actually one of the DataCamp courses) and it's of a very basic level.

The way grading works is that there are some questions on EdX after a video, followed by a ""lab"" in Datacamp, and these are all rather simple and always take you by the hand a lot, to the point that is nearly impossible to not score 100%

EXCEPT that the final labs in the course are  rather complex, and there are questions that need solving with VERY complex Pandas features (That is if you don't know Pandas) that are never explained in the course.

Not to mention some exercises _ONLY_ accept a certain string as a solution (E.g, df.groupby['column'] is wrong but df.groupby.[""column""] is right.

For some background, I come from a liberal arts undergrad and city planning for grad school background, so no stats/econ/computer anything. I'm in a bootcamp now that's covering R, SQL, Tableau, basic stats, etc., and hoping to land a job after that with a local company when it finishes in February. However, I'm starting to be a bit concerned about how well I'm actually prepared coming out of this bootcamp, as talking to recruiters has given me the impression that a lot of getting hired comes down to a technical interview/demonstrating some business knowledge, and I don't really trust my skill level coming out of this bootcamp to do very well in a situation like that (not a knock on the bootcamp, just a statement about my base level of knowledge going into it and how much one can possibly learn when going through so many topics so fast).

Currently I'm working at a job also totally unrelated to data, so I would need to get a job after this bootcamp to start getting experience, and continue to study on my own time, but knowing myself I would have a hard time blocking off time to study via MOOCs, etc., without the pressure of a grade and the support a more formal program might provide. However, the program seems a bit technical in nature, and doesn't seem to focus on Python or the nitty gritty details of SQL, but rather on the statistics and computing side, with some data visualization thrown in, but the advantage  is that it's online and part time. Given my background, is it important/worth it to pursue education in the field in a more formal setting like this, or is this the wrong way to go about it?

I feel that there is a shortage of people who understand both healthcare and data science, hence this might be a good field to study. I know it will be very difficult in terms of the academic rigour, so I'm looking into a couple of full time Master Programs (links below). I am just wondering if anyone from a medical background has picked up data science after having worked for many years in healthcare? And how did you find the transition, particularly the academic rigour?

In terms of my background in maths, I have done some undergrad stats and calculus in my pharmacy degree over 10 years ago, which i have forgotten and then a bit more stats in a postgrad pharmaceutical economics course 4 years ago. However, I do enjoy maths and algebra.

Now, this membership is for an year starting with June 6, 2018 till June 5, 2019. There are still more than 150 days for it to go. I have been able to utilise most of the Data camps content for my benefit and have had an humangous learning experience.

My partner and I have been [recording](https://imgur.com/gallery/muVwJvL)  our relationship daily for a couple months now.

The issue is; **what metrics?**

Right now we are thinking: 
- Elapsed time
- Number of orgasms
- Number of positions
- ???

Hopefully this hasn't been asked too many times already. 

I was at a Google Cloud Platform training seminar the other day as my company is beginning to adopt it for our day-to-day use. One of the speakers (manager of DS at another firm) mentioned how they had high preference for software engineers, because *""its easier to provide DS tools to a coder than to teach an analyst how to code""*. 

With the exposure of DS I've had over the past year or two, I've gathered that the general sentiment is to code and be great at math/stats. When I look at the influencers in this space, I see people with PhDs in math/physics or some sort of proven programming background. 

As for myself, I graduated with a business degree and I've maintained a career today because I'm well-versed in web/mobile analytics. When I perform my analysis, I'm essentially using analytics platforms (e.g. Adobe/Google), SQL when looking at online-offline data and spreadsheets to discover insights; like any BA would.

However, in my space, I'm slowly noticing data scientists build presence in the business space; like unicorns that can code, run models and *present analysis + insights.* And when I'm looking for other web/mobile related jobs, Python and R are already job description standards. I feel that BAs won't have the competitive advantage to compete against data scientists with software and/or doctorate backgrounds in the near future. 

Today, I try to chip away at Datacamp or Python when I can. I've managed to get some basics down, like accessing APIs or running basic regression models. But I treat Data Science like a hobby, something I do for a few hours to a dozen a week (if I'm feeling it). Nonetheless, I don't have it in me to follow the footsteps of what accomplished data scientists have been through. 

What can analysts like me practice and build in our ""playbook"" to stay relevant without having to pour 20+ hours a week to hone the craft? Or is DS a subject matter you can't just ""half-ass""?

Sorry for the long read and much thanks for any insights that come through!

However, in all examples I see:
1) the players are connected if they have passed to each other, there is only one connection even if they have made 20 passes with each other
2) the weight is used to indicate the amount of passes, high weight = many passes. Everyone seems to make this assumption but I don't understand why its done that way. Shouldn't weight be high if its a ""difficult"" path, or a longer path? So shouldnt the weight be the inverse of the amount of passes?

3) additionally when calculating some metrics that use shortest path between nodes. In football every player has often performed atleast one pass to another player, so usually its a fully connected network. Can distance be described using the average distance of the passes between two nodes or something? Sure the goalie has succesfully made a pass to the striker, but this pass is very risky, and most likely the shortest path to the striker is in fact through defender, to midfielder to striker.

I have access to Python, R, and Tableau currently. My goal is to start doing some analytics type work over the next few months, with the goal of shifting my role enough that I can try to push for a new job title/official role for myself, probably as a data analyst. I want to do a couple of things:

1. Automate some reporting in Python to help reduce the total amount of grunt work
2. Produce some light analytics work that would impress management

Like I said, currently theres basically zero exposure to analytics of any kind currently, just basic reporting, so I think there should be some low hanging fruit I can exploit.

Some background about me:

* I have about 5 years of work experience as a data science consultant. Work experience has involved a split between BI and machine learning.
* I have 2 stellar letters of recommendations. 1 from a mid-level manager and 1 from a senior director (different  but equally good companies).
* My bachelor's degree was in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
* My grades in college were not very good. Slightly below average and wildly varying between semesters and subjects.
* My best letter of recommendation from a professor is lukewarm at best.

I don't have strong inclinations for any specific area to focus on. I just want to pick 1 area and really delve into it during my time at grad school, as I find juggling learning multiple topics while also handling a full-time job stressful and not very conducive to making great progress.

Brief introduction  I work in finance, like my job and have a very decent salary. However, good things dont last and Im becoming increasingly worried by AI/machine learning technologies, which may well replace my job in a not so distant future.

Therefore, Id like to differentiate myself from the crowd of future jobless finance guys by completing a masters degree in data science/machine learning. Now, you may wonder, why a master degree? Well, I work in a country (not the US) where degrees are highly recognized. Moreover, I do not want to become a data scientist but rather *signal* to future employers that I know finance and data science/machine learning. In my country, Coursera certificate, nanodegree and the rest are not recognized at all.

I was hoping that you could provide me with some guidance about 1) which online degree I could do 2) how I should prepare for it. Big caveat: I have a wife, two kids and a lot of work I can realistically spend no more than 10-12 hours per week on studying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some master's degree I'm considering**

\- The famous OMSCS of Georgia tech. Good reviews but seems actually quite hard for people without programming background like me.

\- The online master of computer science of the Illinois University. Kind of like the OMSCS but more expensive.

\- Harvard Extension school: good to get a certificate but getting a master seems very tough.

\- Master of computer and information technology of Upenn on Coursera: good for people without computing background but rather expensive and quite selective.

\- Master of data science from the University of San Diego: looks good on paper (10 hours per week, credit from the micro master are transferred) but has not launched yet.

Any other ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get there**

Here are the MOOCs I have done so far (I have only attended business courses at the university):

\- Machine learning (Coursera)

\- Python for everybody specialization (Coursera).

\- Deep learning specialization (Coursera).

\- Data science bootcamp (Udemy).

&amp;#x200B;

And heres what I plan to do:

\- Linear Algebra Foundations to Frontiers (edX).

\- Calculus 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Coursera).

\- Fundamentals of computing specialization (Coursera) (not sure thats the best choice; are algorithms necessary?)

\- Some probability course TBD.

What do you think?

I am an 18 years old guy from Hungary, who is going to finish secondary school this school year. (in June 2019 to be precise.)

I have been looking at a Danish university called IT University of Copenhagen (link) to study Data Science there. It is actually free for EU citizens, so I would not need to pay tuition fees, only the living costs, which are a higher than here in Hungary, but I think I could afford it with the scolarship offered by the Danish goverment.

As application approaches I am starting to question my decision about moving out to Denmark and studying there.

I was hoping you guys could give me some advice, tell me your experiences or something.

So...

As I mentioned I am 18, and currently I have a girlfriend, with who I have been together for almost 1.5 years now, and it is a really serious relationship, we are planning long-term (I know lots of people say this but we REALLY are...)

This really makes it a lot harder for me to move out to a foreign country to study, but for a long time I thought it would be worth it. Now as I said, I am getting a bit unsure about this.

My first plan was to move out, get the BSc and the MSc degree in 5 years, come back and live happily afterwards.. but my god, 5 years seems like forever. And neither of us really wants to do this anymore.

So I feel like I have 2 options really.

1, I go to Denmark for 3 years, get the BSc, come back home, and start working with it, and try to build a career with work experience, not with a very cool diploma. (I mean a BSc is also cool but be honest, an MSc would be way more benefitial.)

2. I stay for a BSc here in Hungary, with which I can later apply to a foreign university (potentially this one in Denmark) for a MSc degree and then come back home. (I didnt mention - I would like to live and work here in Hungary in my future.)

My questions for you guys would be the following ones :

- What do you think a BSc would be enough for these days from the university I have previously mentioned? (IT University of Copenhagen - itu.dk) Does anyone ever heard/experienced anything good/bad about that uni?

- Is it worth to do a MSc in Data Science? Because I have read hear many different things, many people say you can self-teach it yourself from sites like Coursera. Is it worth the 2 extra years? What are the values you get when completing a MSc? Do you get remarkably better job offers and salary if you have an MSc degree?

- Is it possible to build a career from work experiences and a BSc (in this case it has 2 outcomes) if
  a) the BSc is from the ITU in Data Science?
  b) the BSc is from a Hungarian university in software development or something like that?

I think that is it for now, thank you so much for your attention, and if you have read it the whole way, YOU DA REAL MVP!

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your answers in advance!

If you have any questions about the situations or anything to add please do not hesitate to comment/pm me here or drop me an email - somaseres@gmail.com

Over this time, I created some templates which I use to quickly create plotly graphs, and I turned them into a little open-source project. 

It is just a little Python package which allows for the use of the awesome Plotly library without having to write tons of code. It has sped up my workflow, hopefully others will find it useful as well. 

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly) on Github. 

The below is the first part of the README on [Github](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly):

The [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) library facilitates the creation of beautiful and interactive graphs. However, it can easily require several hundred lines of code to create a presentable Plotly graph. Writing hundreds of lines of code every time a graph is needed isn't feasible for professionals whowork with data and it isn't fun for people working on side projects.

Use rapid\_plotly  to quickly create beautiful and interactive Plotly graphs, or use as a starting point to create your own toolbox of Plotly graph templates.

Current features:

* Functions designed to rapidly prototype Plotly graphs.
* Option to view graphs in Jupyter or to write graph to an html file.
* Barplots, optionally grouped, with error bars and custom hover text.
* Scatterplots, with custom hover text and option to overlay multiple datasets.",1,1

After the third week of doing this, my boss said she wants results, she wants me to paint a story. I am being told that I am aimlessly making graphs. She told me that I need to be obsessed with data science if I want to succeed.

I've cleaned the data, which took 80% of my time, but now I'm not even sure what direction to go in. 

What if my story doesn't make sense or it isn't believable?

What story should I be telling?

There is a lot of pressure for me to deliver now since I have been working on this project for almost a month. This information will end up being shared with executives and if I mess up, then my reputation is ruined. 

She said I have until end of this week to deliver a few trends that I am seeing, but I'm not sure what I can deliver that will impress her. I only have a few days until thanksgiving break, so I know I'll be working on this every night until then. 

I'm starting to look incompetent in front of my team because 1. I am just starting to get into the field and 2. because I haven't presented any results or told any stories that seem interesting.

Part of the issue is that internally, we use JIRA, which uses tickets to track work.  If you're a software engineer, ""write X class"" is a concrete task with an obvious closure point, and it's unlikely to spawn additional work.

With research, it's often unclear when a project is finished, and projects often spawn a ton of subprojects.  For example, if you're researching ""How do we detect whether a user saw an ad on TV?"", exploratory analysis will inevitably spawn subquestions, like ""How do we know at what time and place an ad was shown?"", which would then spawn ""Can we bug the advertising company to give us the data we need to determine at what time and place an ad was shown?""  This would be one branch of subquestions among many.  Some of them turn into dead ends, some of them are fruitful, and we might decide that some just aren't worth exploring.

How do those of you working on research track the work that you're doing?  A standard ticket system does not seem like a good way to track research projects.",7,1

So about two weeks ago, my ipod notes crashed. It showed a brief view of my last viewed note before crashing, and boom, it crashed.

When I reopened it 150+ notes gone. All the way down to 0. When I went to storage, notes did not take up any space when it previously took up 2.5 gb of space. However, although it did not show, the storage left stayed the same before and after.

Now, just some more details, they did not get saved into icloud, or my mail, since the notes were locally stored. They are in the ipods hardrive somewhere.

So this is where it gets more interesting I guess. Since my ipod is jailbroken I was able to look at the files. I found the sqlite file, and viewed it, it did not show any of the notes. I searched every crevice for the notes in the filesystem and nothing. 2.5 gb into nothing.

But it wasn't over, so then I did a spotlight search and boom, they were there. I searched up keywords from my notes, and they were there. When I clicked on it, nothing, the notes app would open and display 0 notes. 

So I did probably the most stupid mistake of my life. I first made a backup of the old notes file. Then deleted it, and allowed ios to make a new file, since i though maybe it just needed to reconfigure itself. I went ahead and replaced the contents of the new file, with the old one and this is where it all went wrong.

Did a spotlight search, nothing. Not even a single trace. When I went back into the file system, I noticed ios made two notes files. 

When I checked the storage it remained the same. And finally i decided to connect to itunes, and it showed documents and data 2.5 gb. 

I went with my final attempt, data recovery center. It cost a grand and I just received an email, saying they were unable to find what I was looking for. So i gave them some keywords, and I am crossing my fingers for their results.

So my questions are:
Can they be recovered?
Is it possibly that all I did was overwrite them, even with the same storage numbers?
Can data recovery centers read internal memory addresses?
Can carved strings contain the notes?
Can the encryption on the ipod prevent data recovery?
Can I sue apple?
Can somebody help me.

Thank you for your time.",5,1

I'm new to ds, but not inclined towards it. Have learned scraping, cleaning and basic analytics for my pentesting tools. Also make scripts from the ground up - because different areas and uses (so no scrapy or other kits for scraping).

Basics: While writing scripts, I needed additional functionalities like argument parser, progress indicator etc.. So import argparse, tqdm etc. Python gets quite easy in this way because all of this is a headache in C/C++.

Problem: Everything is slow! The site response time is good enough, not using proxies or different user agents, the latency is not an issue but the processing site gathering values is.. 

Stuff like beautifulsoup and requests run fast enough, but when compared to the same script written in C (gcc optimized output), python is not just a bit slower, but the difference is significant.

Idk if anyone here compared their scripts, but my C script takes 10mins to gather the data, sort it and analyze it, whereas my python script takes 13 mins without error checking &amp; 15mins with error checking.. Note that the data is just in MB's and not GB.. Each extra value is increasing the time difference.

So, also make VB/C# console app for same stuff and hell, .net loads all kinds of junk in memory, then it creates a seperate thread for UI, so have to create a background asynchronous thread that works seperate from UI.. or else the form will freeze while it does everything for 20+ mins!! Yeah, thats C# for you, even after all double buffering &amp; layout suspension.

So, is there a *faster* alternative to Python,C#, Vb etc.. which is not coding 1K lines of pure C and assembly code.. 

Damn, I evem tried embedding Assembly inside C to make it faster. Changing some registers and using load effective address(lea)..

Ive been interested in getting started in DS for a few months and about 45 days ago started to move in that direction.

Since then I started the Data Science Career Path on DataCamp and have completed 4 courses out of 22 so far.

I have also begun reading the book, An Intro to Statistical Learning: With Application in R (ISL). I am in the 3rd chapter, Linear Regression, right now.

My background: I majored in Communication and Spanish with a minor in Psych. So I have some light statistics work through my quantitative courses, dabbled in SPSS and Decision Trees.

Im currently applying to MS programs in Analytics... NC State, Iowa, Rochester, and Northwestern.

I want to make sure what Im doing has me on the right path.
I want to end up as a Data Scientist, I know theres a lot of hype around the term right now, but Im looking to make sure I learn the skills necessary.

So right now Im thinking about sticking to Python and working almost solely in Python, maybe picking up R in March or April.

Any recommendations for how to really position myself for success?

Im a 25 yo M interested in a career in Data Science and have some questions.  I have a BS in Econ from a top 50ish state school. I have spent the last 15 months working for a small boutique investment bank in M&amp;A Advisory. I was long shot to get into Banking but hustled into a job. Since, Ive switched firms once and Ive climbed in rank twice from intern to analyst to associate in those 15 months (partly due to my performance and partly due to dumb luck and the need arising). I got great experience and learned more than most get to in 3 years in IB. However, Im feeling pretty burned out on Banking. It hasnt really shaped out to be what I thought it was and Id like to move towards something more like data science. I took a fair bit of math, stats, and econometrics as well as a bit of coding in undergrad and did extremely well in them but did not graduate with a good overall GPA (sub 3.0). I may be taking a job soon in Sales/Operations/Data Analysis closer to home with a large government contractor soon also. 

What paths could someone like me use to break into the field? I need to brush up on my stats and coding regardless, but what gives me the best shot at a data science job? Should I get a Masters degree? If so, in what? Econ, Stats, Data Science? My Alma mater offers a Masters in Professional Studies of Data Analytics, a Masters in Information Sciences and Technology with a concentration in Data Science options, as well as a graduate certificate in Business Analytics. There is an online option as well. Would a Masters even make sense given my GPA considering my past and potential future work experience?

What about boot camps and online courses? Ive heard good things about Udemys Data Science courses. 

Finally, my last question is a bit odd but what are the regional characteristics of job options? One of the things that kind of burned me out on Banking was the notion of spending my life in NYC or SF to further my career. Im not much of a city person and dont want to be locked into Silicon Valley forever. Im okay with smaller cities particularly in the South and Mountain West.

**Data Variables**

A)Sales by week

B) Brand aided awareness survey by week

C), Unaided brand awareness survey by week

D) Sentiment Analysis from facebook by week showing positive, neutral, negative sentiment

E) Media spend by channel and campaign message

Media spend will be like ""Facebook with the Price Concentious Ad message for 12/2/2016 or Yahoo with the Family campaign message for 3/1/2017""

There could be two facebook ads run in the same week with differet messages

**Current process**

A) Calculated a rollilng 4 week average of all variables

B) Calculate Adstock decay

C) Run a regression and get expected sales: 

 The Regression is Sales \~ Aided BW+ Unaided BW+Postivie Sentiment Pct+ Media spend

d) calculate contribution by channel , message code, per week

e) Calculate ROI by channel and message code

f) Run an optimization simulation and get a proposed mix for next year

**Questions**

1. How can this be improved? I have access to no other variables
2. Are there any good rules for optimization in this scenario?  My scores shouldnt be doubling spend in oen area vs removing from the other. It should be similar to last year ranges
3. How would you run the optimization. what method",5,1

His final book recommendation  - a book about ""Design Thinking"" is very surprising - he says  


&gt;Being a person whos done a lot of data analysis, one thing that Ive found frustrating is the lack of proper mental model for what is going on when you analyse data. Most universities have a class called data analysis, and typically it presents various useful tools, but rarely discusses what actually happens when you do the analysis itself. *Design Thinking* gives a mental model to describe what happens in this process

&amp;#x200B;

So it got me thinking - in my experience the most challenging and exciting part of working with data is thinking things through, seeing if I'm asking the right question, what we should be looking for, etc. Looking at it that way, that recommendation makes a lot of sense.

I've been working as a data analyst for a medium sized company for just over 2 years. I don't have a maths/statistics/CS background, I studied biology at a leading university during which I had a little exposure to R (nothing I really remember) but that's all. I managed to wrangle my job through a contact and have learnt everything on the job.

I've found myself very bored in my job recently and am struggling to find a way of advancing my skill set any further. It seems as if the only career progression I could really make at this company would be going into management or project co-ordination. The bosses don't seem committed to investing any time/resources into any real cutting edge data analysis, when a request comes up it's quicker and easier to hack something together in SQL/VBA that kind of works rather than doing anything sophisticated. A lot of time is spent simply maintaining legacy systems and it's hard to find a business case for anything particularly creative or cutting edge when what we're doing at the moment works fine. Although I'm sure they'd love someone who is skilled in data science to offer solutions, nobody in any senior position has any experience with things such as statistical analysis or machine learning, so there's nothing driving any development in these areas and nobody to mentor those of us that want to explore these areas. I'd love to learn and develop my skills in Python/R but without anything to apply it to and no time at work to learn the skills I can't see how this would happen. I was promised that I would be using these technologies when I was offered the job but that hasn't transpired, and I don't want to fall behind in my skills compared to the rest of the workforce.

I know that I need to look for another job, but I'm worried that my lack of background knowledge and lack of experience with the more data sciencey side of things will hold me back. In fact a lot of job postings specifically ask for stats/maths degrees and experience in languages that make me feel like a dinosaur. I have strong SQL skills, and experience with cubes, data warehousing, Tableau/PowerBI; the majority of my work day is spent writing SQL code, validating data and generating data reports (and I also inevitably end up doing stuff which isn't really my responsibility like dbadmin/operational jobs). I've tried teaching myself some Python (primarily pandas) when I can but I rarely have time to do that at work and it's difficult without a project to can apply it to and with nobody I can speak to about it.

I really want to break into data science but I worry that my lack of any real world experience with commonly sought after skills, and my lack of a statistical/mathematical background will make it very hard to find the right job outside of my company.

Any advice on how I can break out of this funk would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",9,1

One is called the AI Data Developer and lasts 7 months (full time) with a 12 months apprentice contract at the end. I don't have all the information but it involves data processing, cognitive API, AI development, production and interface, soft skills, project management. The person I spoke to mentioned that there will be classes in python, R, and C++, databases, machine learning, SQL and that there will be certificates obtained (how useful or transferable they are I'm not sure).

The other is called Big Data designer - AI lasts for 50 days or 400 hours so by my estimates around 2-3 months. And at the end there is a permanent contract. They teach python (though I'm under the impression that perhaps they already expect me to know that, it's called python review), machine learning with SciKitLearn, Hadoop, Spark, something called Kafka and Elastic and also some project management and agile methods. Link in French: https://www.devenez.fr/pdf/Programme-formation_Concepteur-Big-Data-Intelligence-Artificielle_Fitec.pdf

I'm strongly leaning towards the latter as it is shorter and I'm not super young (mid thirties) and I'm thinking that any deficiencies in the program I can probably try to compensate for myself (I have a scientific background and am not a stranger to self learning, I've done some stats and linear algebra, lots of R courses (as well as scripting writing for work), I know how to code a bit and have done intro to statistical learning and a little bit of the Andrew Ng course). 

The latter course also posts a salary (30-40K euros) whereas the former they didn't say. But the former may be more rigorous (they are also partnered with Microsoft so I don't know if that's a plus). It appears that they both do many similar things. 

Anyway, I know that without an actual syllabus for each one, it would be hard to decide and I unfortunately don't have access to such documents.

I got a Bachelors of Science in Economics focused on Econometrics and Statistics, picked up some basic coding, and spent about a year and a half working behind a desk as an Analyst in a prestigious field. 

My personal situation changed and I ended up taking a more labor intensive job back home with the intent on returning to Data Analysis and working my way up to Data Science in the soon. However, Ive ended up liking my current job. I like the industry. I like the culture. It pays well. Im not really using my degree, but Im happy. With that said, I cant do this forever. Id like to do this for a number of years and go back to white collar and move into Data Science after I cant do this anymore when Im older. I would do a Masters degree also. 

So my question is would it be the worst thing ever to work blue collar for a number of years before going back? If I did that for lets say 3 or 5 or 10 years and then get a Masters degree, would I be able to get into the field still?

815,2018-11-25,2018,11,25,4,a0169h,[Noob] Finding trends in a dataset? Correlations between every 2 variables? How do I know when to stop digging if nothing can be found from the data?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a0169h/noob_finding_trends_in_a_dataset_correlations/,the_data_noob,1543086359,"Hello, apologies for the noob questions. 

I am working on analyzing data from our ticket management system used for production support. Each department handles their ticket management system differently (total of 10 departments). Some may have different tags, different workflows, etc. The data spans over the past 2 years, the team with the most issues had about 3300, the team with the least issues had about 180 issues. 

But what is consistent is when the issue is created, how long it takes to resolve, when it was resolved, who was assigned to it, level of severity, who created the issue, the description, the title, and the comments. We also have the time it took a reviewer to test and approve the change. 

Each of the 10 departments seem to be somewhat drastically different. If their queue is filled with open issues, they don't resolve them right away or it just sits in the queue for longer than expected. 

I've tried throwing out outliers of each category (description length, comment length, time taken to resolve), then plotted description length vs time taken to resolve, comment length vs time taken to resolve, description length vs time to test/approve, difficulty of the issue (1-5, 5 being difficult) etc.

Basically I'm making scatterplots comparing 2 variables from this dataset.

The other issue is that once I remove outliers and data that would not be relevant  (issues that have not been resolved, proper tags were not used in the workflow, issue did not follow workflow etc) out of my biggest dataset for Department 1, for example, I go from 3300 records to about 800 records. 

I'm not seeing any trends in my dataset after cleaning it, before/after removing outliers, then plotting scatterplots, bar graphs, heatmaps etc. (pandas, seaborn). The only trend I see is that the longer someone spends resolving an issue, the longer the resolution time is, which is not significant because it's so obvious. 

How do I know if I even have enough data to draw any conclusions? 

800 records over 2 years or even 3300 records (without removing outliers) over 2 years for a single department with different teams does not sound like enough data to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Also making conclusions across all departments doesn't make sense since some departments are smaller than others and some departments get more issues of different complexity than others. 

How far do I take this before concluding that there aren't any useful trends? What proof do I need to backup my claim when I show this to my boss? 

The only value I see is if we find a trend that a longer description length or a lower difficulty score leads to a faster resolution time so we can get people to start writing longer descriptions or accurately assessing the difficulty of an issue. But I'm not seeing anything, so I'm not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am trying to think thru is how to set up the objecive function.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost Variables**

I am looking at areas of marketing to allocate my spend.  I have the current spend per channel and their contribution of incremental sales by channel.  I dont have the revenue/profit, I could just put in a proxy price if really needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Budget constraints**

The overall advertising spend number should remain the same.  Also, no area should decrease or increase more than 50%. The boundaries i was given were pretty loose.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I dont want the share of spend in any one category to go up more than 20%.  So, if facebook was 10% of spend last year. I dont want to come back and say it should be 45% this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objective Function - Help**

If i make the variable I want to maximize the incremental sales,  I am having a bit of a mind blank on how i can set up the contraints to maximize this.  

&amp;#x200B;

What would be your variable to maximize? and how would you set up the contraints?  Im assuming its something like multiplying the cost of 1 incremental sales by advertising spend by channel and that would place my bounds.

I apologize profusely before I type in my questions as they are generic ones asked million times on this sub. But I wanted to get a general consensus on my background and chosen curriculum/courses to enter into this field. Thanks in advance for reading and helping!!

Background:
PhD in Materials Sciences from a mediocre university and 2 years of postdoc experience in the same field (materials chemistry, physics, nanotechnology). Currently working as a R&amp;D Engineer in a sensor company. I have preliminary statistical analysis and some curve fitting (linear, polynomial, Gaussian and Lorentzian) experience (2-4 hrs/week). My work is rather slow and TBH I find it rather boring. When I read about DS, I got fairly interested in it. Upon further reading about DS, I felt it would be apt career for me as it pays higher, I can work in the city (fraction from home as well), analytical nature of jobs and seems to have a continuous demand for manpower. With my current work, I can spend ~ 2hrs/day on weekdays and 4-5 hrs/day on weekends on learning DS and ML courses.

- If Data Insight Fellow Program denies my application then take advanced courses and try to land a job by myself

Questions
1. Any feedback on the course curriculum/structure would be appreciated. Any other courses I have missed?
2. Course 4 - Which one would you recommend - Kirill's or Andrew Ng ?
3. Book 2 - Which book would you recommend to go for after Book 1(ISLR)?
4. I have mainly focused on Python for DS and ML. My understanding is that once I able to grasp advance concepts and visualization of Python, transitioning into R would be smooth. Does that sound right?
5. My ultimate goal is to have adequate skills to get into Insight Data Science program based on the reviews I read from reddit and other sources. Does that seem a right goal for a person with my background?

I'm sure I'm 1 of the 1,000s of people that make posts like this, for which I apologise, but I thought I'd give it a go anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Bachelor in Accounting and Masters in Commerce (Finance and Statistics Major) and currently work as a First-Year University Level Statistics Lecturer (Basic Linear Regression, Normal Distribution, Probability etc.), and really want to pursue the Data Analyst/Scientist and maybe even Data Engineer pathway for my career. Whilst my majors are predominately Commerce related, all of my electives are statistics and econometrics based, so I would say my statistical knowledge is more than satisfactory and wouldn't need to brush up my skills here. My main concern is the programming side of things. I should note I'm very technologically savvy so learning isn't the problem, it's more-so, what do I learn?

&amp;#x200B;

To date, I have next to no knowledge of any of the frequently recurring programming skills needed for a data related postion i.e. Python, R, SQL etc. However, after reading through a few 'Packts' and just skimming through a few textbooks for Data Analysis, it seems pretty straight forward, as they always just cover the basics i.e. plots, inferential statistics, regression etc. I should note I have strong knowledge of BI tools such as Tableau, where I built a website containing a dashboard for a set of data, which I believe is good for my resume portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

My query is this; at present, I don't know what I don't know, as books and online references make learning these programming languages seem very simplistic, however, I know that isn't the case, as I'm sure these languages can do things that I haven't even thought of. My main aim for this is to get a job in the field, however I want to know what exactly I'll be doing so I don't focus on breadth of knowledge instead of depth of knowledge. i.e. I learn everything and only use 20% of that knowledge in the real world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hear everyone say, 'Practice by doing', which I completely agree with, as reading books without applying it is almost completely useless, however, how do I know which projects I should be doing which will showcase the required skills, if I don't know the required skills. All I ever hear people say is, 'I extract data from the web, manipulate it, then interpret it'...Okay.... If that's the case, Data Science is very easy, as I could literally carry a Cookbook around and copy and paste while changing a few variables. But I know that's not everything you do.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the NBA, so doing projects with NBA data would be interesting for me. I could very easily create plots, regression analysis etc. for this data using R or Python simply by following instructions online or from a book, but that seems to easy. Has anyone got any ideas, which are somewhat challenging where I can possibly show a multitude of computer programming skills i.e. SQL, R, Python, Tableau and D3.js all in one. Ideally I'd like to start a project which can take a couple of weeks to a few months, not one which would involve just extracting data using Pandas and the using gg-plot to create a scatter diagram. That seems a bit too simplistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cliffs;

\- I have a solid knowledge of statistics

\- No computer science background, but since I use a computer everyday for 8-10 hours, I'm extremely well versed in the in-and-outs of software and hardware i.e. solve all my own computer problems, I have a solid working knowledge Command Prompt, built my own desktop etc.

\- In need of project ideas which will help me showcase a multitude of skills at once, rather than the basics such as extracting data and drawing a scatter plot/doing inferential statistics.

I am new here. I will be graduating with a PhD in aerospace engineering and scientific computing some time next year. I am strongly considering a career in machine learning/data science. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for advice on how to effectively make the transition, and things that I could do to strengthen my profile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my background: 

My PhD is not based on machine learning or data science, but on developing and implementing physics-based models for atmospheric entry vehicles. Most of my PhD work is based on applying numerical methods and programming (techniques such as parallel computing and using non-trivial data structures such as graphs, hash tables, etc...) to solve these problems computationally, and assess the computational model's validity against experimental data. I work with a large amount of ""data,"" but I wouldn't say that I am working with large data in the ""statistical"" sense. Aside from my PhD research, I supplemented my lack of breadth (typical for PhDs) with graduate level courses in machine learning, deep learning, data mining, grad-level algorithms, artificial intelligence, computational data science, and numerical linear algebra and other numerical methods courses. I have not taken a pure probability course, but most of the courses listed above uses probability, so hopefully I have sufficient knowledge. 

I am also planning on implementing/introducing some deep learning techniques to my dissertation topic, and to my research community (no one uses ML in my research domain unfortunately), as sort of a ""cherry on top"" of my dissertation. I am proficient in C++, Fortran, Matlab, and Python. Oh and I go to a top 5 school in my field, if that's relevant...

&amp;#x200B;

I have NO industrial data science/machine learning experience. A friend of mine and I are developing a machine learning library as a side project as a learning experience, and we intend to participate in some Kaggle competitions. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this is basically my background, and I'm looking for advice on what I can do to improve my profile for a potential transition into data science/machine learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some other questions that I have are:

(1) How much of data science positions is just the application and implementation of machine learning methods? 

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Is the insight data science fellows program really worth it? I don't like the idea of taking a 100% pay cut for over a month if I can effectively/easily make the transition without the program. And how selective is the process? I can't seem to find any information on what the selection process is other than that it is ""very selective."" 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) This may be an ignorant question, and it may just be my lack of awareness, but I feel like the job titles that include ""machine learning"" usually exist at tech companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple, etc...), and the title ""data scientist"" is for positions not at these tech companies, but most of these data scientists seem to be doing machine learning stuff. 

If this is true, why is this? How are the two differentiated? 

&amp;#x200B;

When I google ""top data science companies,"" I don't really see any big/well-known tech companies listed. Do these companies just not use the ""data scientist?""

I have about 100 PDFs which contain precinct-level election data dating back to 2004. I want to create a tabular dataset from these PDFs, which allows for the precinct voting history to be analyzed. 

Many of them are flat, I was able to use Adobe Acrobat to read the text into a pdf.

[Here is a Google Drive folder containing all of the PDFs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zdmkh1hUCf_rvnCrYiUP8NSXm_6RKXCB?usp=sharing). There is scant consistency between election years, and many of the PDFs are two-column PDFs. I can turn these into text strings using a couple of different tools (e.g. a Python package), but there aren't any line breaks, so it is hard for me to figure out how to parse the file when it is one big line with the columns merged together. 

Has anyone worked on a problem like this? Any ideas on how to approach this? Regex maybe?

I am a european student in a statistics' bachelor (3rd year) and I am considering specializing in Data science for my master.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I kind of doubt whether this is actually a good idea... because : the market.

The profession of data science has been heavily mediatised and many people chose data science for their master as way to ""secure a job"". 

Along with that, pretty much every university have opened programs in "" ML-DL-CV-NLP-DataScience-Blockchain-GAFAM-StartupNation ""

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont like the idea of specializing in something... along with pretty much everyone else.

Supply and demand is what operates the markets. I m sure that the demand for data scientists is growing but so is the supply, maybe it grows even faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth it to go into that field now? Considering that I ll be out of college in 3 years and will need AT LEAST 3-5 years of experience before the companies start seeing me as somehow valuable.

In 10 years, will the supply be way bigger than the demand?

&amp;#x200B;

Primarily, I'm looking for interesting or relevant examples of DS that I could mention that high schoolers might find engaging. Anyone have good suggestions?  


So far i'm thinking:   
\- Self driving cars  
\- image recognition (esp. facebook tags, &amp; video filters/overlays)  
\- Game AI (eg. starcraft, DOTA , board games...)  
\- ok google/alexa/siri   
\- recommendation engines (eg netflix, youtube, advertising)  


Then i can use the last one to transition in to outlining the more boring/profitiable common business applications (ad optimization, market forecasting, ...)  


  
One other small thing i'd like to do that I could use help/reference for: I want to write out all the equations involved in a basic linear regression and explain it with a basic example (which is relatively digestable). Then have another slide where I list a long slew of equations involved in a more complex algorithm just to serve as a visual point of comparison of how much more complex algorithms get. I thought writing out some of the math behind a neural network WITHOUT linear algebra or matrix notation might get the point across. But I'd love to find an example of something like this existing already without having to recreate it. Anyone got a good lead to something like that?

Long post warning!

So here goes, i majored in computer science in my undergrad, got lost into the investment banking world for a bit. Then through a job in a data science consulting company turned back towards cs and data science.  Was with the consulting company for 2 years, and in the past 2 years, i have been part of a gaming company leading their marketing analytics team. I have always been hands-on and hence, i am deeply familiar with machine learning models. Can describe and derive math for some of the models (linear, backprop and some generative models), and write code to demonstrate the inner workings of linear/ensemble/ANN models. At work, i'm able to guide data scientists and analysts to build libraries, models for clustering, classification, and regression. We have built systems that do media buying, or automate sales. So far, i have hands-on experience building time-series models, regression models for various purposes, churn prediction models, customer behavior clustering models. i feel i can code and have been able to cover about 180 questions on Leetcode with about 45% acceptance rate. 

I'm often intimidated by folks who studied machine learning in school, feel like without a formal education i have been missing out on something. I try to fill the gaps, and try to take courses have been through Stanford's CS 229 and going through cs231n (a bit challenging for me).   
  
I feel like i'm making a difference at work. Our models allows for plenty of experimentation and automation for media buying and feature experimentation. Product Managers and marketing managers rely on our models to make decisions. 

My questions are as follows:

1.	Would machine learning teams in FAANG consider my profile for recruitment? If yes, what is the typical level to target - (lead or individual contributor or manager)?


2.	Im a little worried about my age (34) and think that it might be work against me. Should i be worried?


3.	Do you advice i continue to pursue a management career? although my bosses and reportees like me, im not too fond of it. 


4.	Should i consider going back to school and get deeper into machine learning? i feel that the research is exploding and i cant keep up along with work.

**Background:**

I have to be a little vague here, but I run an analytics group that is responsible for identifying fraud or misuse of various systems, as well as testing whether things are working appropriately. 

**Software Used:**

We work mainly in Python &amp; R, with another specialized software used for simple filtering/transformation of data at times. 

**Experience:**

My team and I's experience runs the gauntlet, with Business Analysts, Data Analysts, Software Developers, and Data Scientists. Between us, we usually have the skills required to get what we need doing. 

**Problem:**

One of the things that I have noticed as my group has grown is that no matter what we are testing or building, a lot of the root cause identification process is built around identifying anomalies. This usually falls under three types: an unusual amount of similar transactions, transactions outside of the standard deviation, or a lack of information where there should be some. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been tinkering with the idea of trying to build a program that can take a fist pass at identifying these anomalies and save my team time from building them individually every time. The skeleton structure of the program is below:

* Import/Access the table of information that will be analyzed
* Identify the type of information contained within each column
* Perform a base analysis over the information contained based on the type (standard deviation, mean, etc.)
* Create exception populations for any identified anomalies by column
* Create an output report giving basic information on the fields and any anomaly types identified

My preference would probably be to build this in Python, since I'm most comfortable working within it. I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on packages that would help, scripts that are already written that do something similar, etc. I'd like to ideally free up some of my teams time from building these repetitive tasks that are similar at their base concepts so that they can do the real work of finding real anomalies.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

It seems that no matter how good you are at your current job, if you want to get a new one, then you will need to prepare for technical interviews and challenges. Then you might get lucky and get asked to solve problems you are comfortable with or you might get unlucky and fail. It feels that performing the job and interviewing for one are much further apart than they should be. But this might simply be my view on it, so I'd like to know what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

**The full story**

I'm not particularly happy with my work right now and I'm passively looking for another job. With that in mind, I'm having to go through a range of dreadful recruitment tests with limited success.

A bit of relevant background: I'm a data scientist with an MSc degree and 5+ years of international industry experience. I currently work for a company with a substantial number of Glassdoor interview reviews most of which are marked as ""hard"" and I would agree that the recruitment process that I had to go through was intense indeed.

Having said that, I don't think that I'm smarter than the next guy, I just worked really hard at Uni to get good grades and eventually landed a decent job that got me into this industry in the first place. Nonetheless, one would think that since I managed to get through a tough recruitment process, then I should be able to do it again. However, I've already failed a couple of technical tests which I felt were substantially easier than the one I passed to get into my current role. 

As frustrating as it is, I find that most recruitment tests have no relevance to the actual work that you are likely going to be doing if you get the job. Admittedly, some tests are better than others, for examples I've seen case studies that aim to test a broad range of skills, while other tests check pure, abstract mathematics or probability theory -- not something you are likely to do 9-5 every day. I'm sure that I'll get another decent job and I'm sure that I'll need to pass a tech interview/challenge to get there, but I'll need to thoroughly prepare for it first.

I'd be interested to hear what you guys think about recruitment processes in data science. More specifically:

* Are you also struggling or being inconsistent with tests even if you feel that you have what it takes to get the job done?
* Managers out there -- how do you feel about this gap between the actual work and the way you assess candidates? Wouldn't you think that a suitable candidate shouldn't have to prepare for a job interview (you'd expect that they should be doing enough relevant work in their current role)?
* What do you think is the best way to prepare for an interview (bearing in mind that there tends to be a lot of variety in them)? On that note, I can recommend a few resources such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Interviewing.io](https://Interviewing.io), [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-preparation/), [CareerCup](https://careercup.com/)

For context, I'm not a data scientist. I'm a financial analyst. 


I recently was offered to interview for an analyst position in a revenue growth management team at a large company. I started checking out the linkedIn profiles of who I'll be interviewing with and it seems like all except for management have STEM degrees/MBA's and come from a very quantitative/data sciency background. Looking back at the job description they heavily emphasized building analytical models. But... The preferred degrees for this position are finance, accounting, and marketing which aren't nearly as analytical as data science. 


It doesn't mention anything about programming or using python/R, although on my resume I do have python and VBA listed because I've taken a few online courses and occasionally use them in my current job. 


I just was wondering if anybody knew if this sounds like data science because I don't want to walk into an interview that I'm not even qualified for. I've never heard of Revenue Growth Management either, is that a common thing in the data science field? It sounded a lot like business strategy which is a career that I'm very interested in pursuing. 

Thanks for your time!


TL;DR: Is Revenue Growth Management a Data science job? I'm a financial analyst with no data science background and accepted an interview for a position in RGM and I don't want to be embarrassed. ",2,1

Moreover, there is a shortage of talent and the demand for data scientist still increases.

There was some research that showed, analyzing bad data can cost a typical organization more than $13 million every year. Therefore, there will always be a demand for individuals who can wipe out bad data that can alter results or lead to inaccurate insights for an organization.

I can only gather data from a small subset of subreddits, and I am looking for advice on determining how to select the best subreddits to consider for my purpose. I apologize for the long length of this post--I tried to make it concise. 

**Here is a brief overview of the project:** 

I consider a post popular if it achieves a score greater than some threshold by the end of the day. I haven't yet decided upon the exact threshold I want to use, however (I am considering whether to predict viral posts or just generally high-scoring posts, but leaning towards the latter, and ideally a model that has good interpretability). I am tracking submissions from several subreddits in real-time, over the course of about one week. Among other things, I am getting the score of each post every 5 minutes so that I can track score-progression over time, and use some features in my model based on this time-series data. The goal is to predict whether a post will become popular as early as possible. 

The issue I am having is deciding which subreddits would provide the best data for my model. So far, I have approached this problem in a few ways:

1. I got every submission that reached the front page of 
r/all/top over a 100-day period and made a histogram of the subreddits: [Histogram](https://i.imgur.com/6zpYiaD.jpg). While this indicates which subreddits tend to have the highest-scoring posts, my concern is that distribution of scores from the subreddit may also be important. If I was only concerned with posts becoming viral (very high score), this would certainly be helpful, but if I am more concerned with just generally high-scoring posts, then perhaps this is less useful. It is possible that there are other subreddits which do not reach the front page as often, but whose posts have a higher median score, with less skew to their score-distribution. If this is true, I am unsure as to whether looking at these subreddits might yield better data for my model. In other words, my histogram might be showing subreddits that are more about quantity over quality, but because of that quantity, their posts hit the upvote-jackpot more often, whereas other subreddits provide quality over quantity.

2. I also considered simply looking at subreddit subscriber-counts and choosing the top *N* subreddits from this list. 

3. Finally, I considered blending these two options and including only the subreddits that overlap between both lists. 

Neither of these routes completely satisfies me because they are essentially still educated guesses at the moment. I haven't been able to find any sites or existing research that shows the distributions of submission-scores for lots of subreddits, nor am I even sure what type of distribution would best suit my needs. I also realize that different subreddits will have their own unique patterns, but I am hoping that with good feature selection and engineering I can still develop a model with decent predictability and generalizability. If anyone has any insight to offer, whether it's in support of one of the above approaches, or an alternative method, it would be greatly appreciated.

I've taken one class from the micro masters and am signed up to do the other two. I'll likely get a high B in the class. I have a degree in economics from an unimpressive state university. I took calculus and used it a lot in my econ degree, but I didn't take linear algebra. I'm taking a MOOC in linear algebra and the GT intro to computing with python class that they recommend.

I have no work experience, but my father in law has a small business and asked me to be an intern of sorts and play around with his data using what I've learned in my class. So far it's not going very well, but I haven't been able to dedicate much time to it lately. I'm hoping to do some real work for him asap so I can use that on my rsum.

The admission requirements are:

*  Probability/statistics
* Computer programming in Python at the level of[I](https://www.edx.org/xseries/gtx-introduction-to-computing-in-python)ntroduction to Computing in Python
* Calculus and basic linear algebra

Like I said, I don't have a super strong computing or math background, but I'm taking some courses. In college I took a very basic statistics class, as well as one econometrics class. My major had the quantitative bar set ridiculously low because if they required a year of calc, linear algebra and econometrics, nobody would have signed up.

The author web scraped information from [newegg.com](https://newegg.com/) after keying in ""graphics card.""

The codes are as follows so far.

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup

    page_soup = soup(page_html, ""html.parser"")
    containers = page_soup.findAll(""div"", {""class"":""item-container ""})
    len(containers)
    container = containers[0]

Len(containers) gave correct number of products, which was 36 search results. The author isolated the first element so he could create codes and iteration to extract later on some information such as the brand and name for all the graphics cards.

It's a pretty fundamental problem, especially if you are working with identifying data sets.

I have seen a handful of discussions about how data science can be used for good, which usually comes down to ""social good"" applications, medicine, biostats, etc. But nothing about privacy, and as I noted, it may just be an inherent contradiction.

Hello Reddit, I am trying to fit 3 years of hourly energy consumption data (hourly data is the average for each month) into an ARIMA model for future prediction. This is how the raw data [This is how the raw data looks like](https://imgur.com/XzOOyek).

After both seasonal and non seasonal de-trend (0,1,0)(0,1,0)24 I got [This](https://imgur.com/7jETuMT). 

Looking at the ACF Y PACF values [Here](https://imgur.com/uUfp4a1). Its seems that an Arima (0,1,0)(1,1,1)24 could fit the data.

After such model is applied residual [ACF PACF](https://imgur.com/uUfp4a1). seems to be stabilize.

Now here is the question, I am having problem fitting the data at certain critical points as n=19, n=1, n=2 (data is ciclical) where the real value reach high/low peaks and the model seems to not been able to follow with precision.

That is why I tried to apply a Garch model but after looking at the ACF and PACF correlation functions for square residuals (see last picture) the only lag that affects the data is lag #24, isn't that too high?

Another question is, is the (G)arch model the right model to control those error? I am honestly not too sure.

Thanks in advance.

2) in a luxury brand. Classical subject (sales forecasting etc ..). **Short to mid-term project** in various subject with data scientists that seem junior (less than 5 years experience) and data science **department is fairly new**.  **Pay is real good**, more than twice the first offer with lots of benefits. And **possible hire** after the internship (intended as a job trial)

3) in a travel company. Same thing as in 2), but with a **DS department that is much more established** (with several senior data scientist) with several teams focusing on a specific theme.

Pardon my emotions, but I feel very sad about my developing data science career so far. I am currently creating a data visualization web application without understanding the purpose of the app, the data itself, and the problems associated with the information that I am trying to present. I have taken initiative to ask for understanding from my managers, and they would just say ""it doesn't matter"" or something condescending like ""you won't understand"". I have even tried taking extending the visualizations by implementing my own machine learning insights, only to be faced with having that labeled as a ""waste of time"". I am practically doing front end development using Javascript with the false label ""data scientist"" as my title.

This had me searching for new job openings and creating new opportunities for myself. I have been working on my personal project relating to semantic analysis on TED Talks, but find myself feeling discouraged due to how overwhelming it can be. Questions like ""What if my results are not good enough?"" or ""Is this really important to employers?"" or even, ""What exactly is the purpose of this?"" continually run in my mind, causing me to feel more discouraged in taking steps forward. I have been doing a lot of self-study in natural language processing to prepare myself for some of the challenges faced in this project, and even wrote a rough draft of the ideas that I would like to implement in my analysis, so I have made some progress.

I have also been applying for jobs relating to data science. Of course the majority of the positions rejected me due to lack of experience. Of the few companies that gave me the chance to interview in the final in-person setting, all of them had rejected me due to various reasons. I have a Masters degree in mathematics, and the majority of my analytics experience, (machine learning, Python, SQL, R, etc.) is showcased through small mini-projects (which I am honestly not proud of) done through a data science bootcamp. All of these rejections are contributing to thoughts like ""Maybe, I'm not good enough to be a data scientist"" or ""companies probably want to hire the best of the best in the field"", causing me to feel highly unqualified in any other role that I want to apply for.

I feel really stuck and haven't been getting much sleep due to this, and I am feeling really unhappy. Ever since I was a little boy, I grew up loving mathematics because I enjoyed seeing the parallels between mathematical concepts and real-world occurrences. I have done mathematical competitions, performed well in them, wrote a mathematics academic paper, received an award for my presentation in a national math conference, and continued solving math problems in my free time. I am struggling translating this passion in the data science field because it seems that no matter how hard I try, I fail for various reasons.

Anyone have any further tips on dealing with burn-out? Data science is a really difficult field to get your foot in the door and each passing day feels more discouraging than ever.",6,1

I am currently developing my personal website, and thought about reaching out to my peers for some direction.

I have been in the data science sphere for a little more than 3 years now. The first year was part of a research lab and my thesis on gender equality through machine learning. The next two was working for Corporate America, building forecasting and anomaly detection products, where I doubled up my data science background with software development skills.

Now, given that I was mostly the owner of my product, when putting that into my website, Im inclined to put more of the product features that correlate with DS/ML. Intuitively, I know thats not really a good idea since other people would probably look for how I fit into the project rather than features of the product I built. But I also do want to put some of the cool features across.

What is the best way of achieving that parity of advertising myself not just as the data scientist but also as the person who is very product oriented?

Also, if you were hiring a data scientist, what would you want to look for in my personal website? 

I do not really do Kaggle competitions or Hackathons since work itself is quite hectic (Im part of a 2 member team working on forecasting 200+ machine performance metrics that the organization depends on for on call support). And I also do not have any personal projects so far for similar reasons, though Im starting carve some time out of my daily personal schedule to rectify that.

How else can I make my website reflect the focused employee that I am in my real life?

Todays increased level of automation in manufacturing also demands automation of material quality inspection with little human intervention. The trend is to reach human level accuracy or more in quality inspection with automation. To stay competitive, modern Industrial firms strive to achieve both quantity and quality with automation without compromising one over the other.

**Deep Learning for Quality inspection:**

To meet industry standards quality inspectors in manufacturing firms inspect product quality usually after the product is manufactured, its a time consuming manual effort and a rejected product results in wasted upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. With the modern trend of Artificial Intelligence, industrial firms are looking to use Deep learning based computer vision technology during the production cycle itself to automate material quality inspection. The goal is to minimize human intervention at the same time reach human level accuracy or more as well as optimize factory capacity, labor cost etc. The usage of Deep learning is varied, from object detection in self-driving cars to disease detection with medical imaging deep learning has proved to achieve human level accuracy &amp; better.

**What is deep learning?**

Deep learning is the field of learning deep structured and unstructured representation of data. Deep learning is the growing trend in AI to abstract better results when data is large and complex. Deep learning architecture consists of deep layers of neural networks such as input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Hidden layers are used to understand the complex structures of data. A neural network doesnt need to be programmed to perform a complex task. Gigabytes to terabytes of data just need to be fed to the neural network architecture to train or learn on its own. Sample Deep Neural Networks below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ywc5hv8pb8121.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Convolution neural Network**:

Convolution neural network is a class of deep neural network commonly applied in image analysis. Convolution layers apply a convolution operation to the input passing the result to the next layer. For example an image of 1000 by 1000 pixels has 1 million features. If the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons, it ends up having 1 billion parameters after the first hidden layer. With that many parameters, its difficult to get enough data to prevent a neural network from overfitting. The computational and memory requirements to train a neural network with a billion parameters is prohibitive. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. There are two main advantages of using convolution layers over fully connected layers  parameter sharing and sparsity of connections.

Convolution neural network look for patterns in an image. We convolve the image and look for patterns. The first few layers can identify lines / corners / edges etc, and these patterns are passed down into the deeper neural network layers to recognize more complex features. This property of CNNs is really good at identifying objects in images.

ConvNet is a sequence of layers. Three main types of layers are used to build ConvNet architectures: **Convolutional Layer**, **Pooling Layer**, and **Fully-Connected Layer**. These layers are stacked layers to form a full ConvNet **architecture:**

&amp;#x200B;

The below image clarifies the concept of a **convolution layer**:

The below image clarifies the concept of a **pooling layer (Average or Max pooling)**:

Following is one of the original CNN architectures:

**Visualizing CNN**:

Following is an image of a crack on a plain surface:

Two layers each of Conv (one 3X3 filter), ReLU and Max Pooling (2X2) similar to LENET-5 architecture are applied to the crack image above. It can be seen below that the CNN architecture is focusing on the blocks of crack area and the spread of it throughout the surface. Left had side is the original image and right hand side after applying the architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0cgrbuuyb8121.png

**Case Study:**

**Problem Statement:**

Detecting bad quality material in semiconductor component manufacturing (such as a chip) is an error prone &amp; time consuming manual process and results in false positives (detecting a bad one as good one). If a faulty chip (chip with a scratch/crack) is detected at the end of the production line there is loss in upstream labor, consumables, factory capacity as well as revenue. On the other hand, if an undetected bad chip gets into the final product there will be customer impact as well as market reaction. This could potentially lead to unprecedented and unrepairable damage to the reputation of the organization.

**Solution**:

We automated defect detection on our hardware products using Deep Learning. During SMT (Surface Mount Technology) manufacturing processes there could be damage such scratch / crack on the dies which makes it unusable for the next processes in the production line. Our Deep learning application detected a die level defect such as crack / scratch in milliseconds with over 88% accuracy and also interpreted with heat maps where the convolution neural network is focusing on.

**Details of our Deep Learning Architecture**:

**Our first approach**:

We first extracted the ROI (region of interest) with Computer Vision (non-machine learning methods) and then performed defect detection on the ROI using deep neural networks.

**Why ROI extraction before DL**?

 While capturing the images, camera and lighting was focusing on the whole area. We are inspecting the chip area only for defects

 We found with a few experiments that DL accuracy increased substantially when our neural networks were focusing only the area of interest rather than the whole area

 First Extract **Region of Interest (ROI)** with Computer Vision (Non-Machine Learning Methods). Here, we go through multiple processes on the image such as gray scaling, transformations such as dilating, eroding, closing the image etc. and eventually curve out the ROI from image based on chip type etc. These steps help in opening up unseen cracks/ scratches in the image etc., please refer the figure below :

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img v1u876b0c8121...*

 Secondly **Detect defects** using **Deep Neural Networks**(Deep Neural Network (CNN)-Based Models) using proven CNN topologies such as Inception Net(aka Google Net), Res Net, Dense Net :

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img n871r5z0c8121...*

 **Data Augmentation**: We have 1k unique images labelled as defects and 1k unique images labelled as good ones. Research say 2k images would not be enough to train our deep nets to generalize well on unseen images. Augmentation is critical to avoid overfitting the training set. We did **5 random crops** and **4 rotations** (1 original image results in 20 augmented images). After augmentation we have **20k defective images** and **20k good images**.

 **Initialization strategy** for **CNN** topologies:

 We replaced the final connected layer with our own FC layer and sigmoid layer (binary classification). Please refer the figure below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xi4qjnv1c8121.png

 Rather than random initialization of weights in each layer we considered ImageNet initialization for each CNN topology, our DL accuracy have increased substantially when we used ImageNet initialization than random.

 **Loss Function** and **Optimizer**:

 Cross Entropy loss: It has a nice interpretation as probability score

 **SGD** and **Nesterov momentum** is a common choice of optimizer: Convergence property of optimizers is still an active area of research

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zlkdvig7c8121.png

**Our Second approach**:

**Issue with our first approach**: Preprocessing uses the SMT/ chip type info etc. when extracting regions of interest, require rewriting code whenever there are changes in chip types, camera setups / directions etc.

**Solution:** We built an end-end two step DL architecture. In the first step, instead of a CV approach we used a DL approach to predict the ROI itself. We manually created a labelled dataset with a bounding box tool &amp; we let train a DL architecture to predict the ROI itself. One downside of this technique is that the labelled dataset has to be explicit and extensive enough to include all SMT/ Chip types for the use case. Please refer the figures below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c139lc88c8121.png

 **CNN ROI generator Loss function:**

 We initially used a squared **distance based** loss function

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jcze1aj9c8121.png

This is what we achieve on the validations:

**Ave. missed area = 8.52 \* 10-3**

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.7817**

We want to improve at least on the **IOU**

 We came up with an **Area based loss,** please refer the figure below to get an idea of how we use basic math to calculate the area of intersection between the ground truth and the predicted label. our goal in the loss function is to penalize both the missed and the excess area. Ideally, we would want to penalize the missed area more than the excess area:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img x97bjwxcc8121...*

The Loss funcion above is differentiable so we can do gradient descent optimization on the loss function

 **CNN ROI generator Augmentation**: Simply added margins 5% (both left and right) margins during training time and test time on our predicted ROIs:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vgr1i7wdc8121.png

 **CNN ROI generator results:**  We used Resnet50 (ImageNet initilization) toplogy and SGD + Nesterov momentum optimizer with  first parameter =2 &amp; second paremeter =1 in the **area based loss** as described above (penalizing more the missed area compared to the excess area). Training the Resnet-50 model for muliple epochs we want to minimze our avg. missed area and maximize our avg. IOU (Best IOU is 1). After training for 20 epochs we achieved the following on the validation set, with area based loss and augmentation we improved our velidation metric on missed area and IOU:

**Ave. missed area = 3.65 \* 10-3**

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.8577**

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiments &amp; Benchmarks**:

 **Experiment**:

Total # of images: 2k

Data split: 80-to-10-to-10 split, using unique images only

Framework used: PyTorch &amp; Tensorflow / Keras

Weights Initialization: Pre-trained on ImageNet

Optimizer: SGD with lr = 0.001, using Nesterov with momentum = 0.9

Loss: Cross entropy

Batch size: 12

Total # of epochs: 24

Image shape: 224x224x3 (except for Inception V3, which requires 299x299x3)

Criterion: Lowest validation loss

&amp;#x200B;

**Benchmarks with Pytorch Models**:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img l4hhybhfc8121...*

Our benchmarks with both the approaches are pretty comparable with the CV+DL (first) approach little better off than the DL+DL (second) approach. We believe, our DL+DL could be better if we can create an extensive and explicit labelled bounding box dataset.

**Inference**:

**Intel Open Vino**: Based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), the Intel Open Vino toolkit extends workloads across Intel hardware and maximizes performance:

\- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge

\- Supports heterogeneous execution across computer vision acceleratorsCPU, GPU, Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, and FPGAusing a common API

\- Speeds time to market via a library of functions and pre-optimized kernels

\- Includes optimized calls for OpenCV and OpenVX\*

Please refer the following figures on Open Vino architecture:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img w69ankcic8121...*

Two Step Deployment:

\- Step one is to convert the pre-trained model into IRs using **Model Optimizer**:

 **Produce a valid Intermediate Representation**: If this main conversion artifact is not valid, the Inference Engine cannot run. The primary responsibility of the Model optimizer is to produce the two files to form the Intermediate Representation.

 **Produce an optimized Intermediate Representation:** Pre-trained models contain layers that are important for training, such as the dropout layer. These layers are useless during inference and might increase the inference time. In many cases, these layers can be automatically removed from the resulting Intermediate Representation. However, if a group of layers can be represented as one mathematical operation, and thus as a single layer, the Model Optimizer recognizes such patterns and replaces these layers with one. The result is an Intermediate Representation that has fewer layers than the original model. This decreases the inference time.

The IR is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

.**xml**: Describes the network topology

.**bin**: Contains the weights and biases binary data

\- Step two is to use the **Inference Engine** to read, load, and infer the IR files, using a common API across the CPU, GPU, or VPU hardware

Please take a look at the Open Vino documentation on how to infer with Caffe and Tensorflow models [https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3](https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3)

Overall, we are able to infer on new image in milliseconds using the Intel hardware accelerators.

**Visualizing our CNNs with Heat Maps**:

Often deep neural networks are criticized for low interpretability and most deep learning solutions stop at the point when the classification of the labels are done. We wanted to interpret our results, why the CNN architecture labelled an image as good or bad (binary classification for our case study), which area in the image the CNN is focusing most.

Based on this research in MIT [https://](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf)[arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf) , a class activation map in combination with the global max pooling layer has been proposed to localize class specific image regions.

Global average pooling usually acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting during training. It is established in this research that the advantages of global average pooling layer extend beyond simply acting as a regularizer - little tweaking, the network can retain its remarkable localization ability until the final layer. This tweaking allows identifying easily the discriminative image regions in a single forward pass for a wide variety of tasks, even those that the network was not originally trained for.

Following is a heat map interpretation using this technique on the crack on a plain surface image using Resnet-50 architecture trained on ImageNet.  As we can see, the heat map focusses on the crack area below although the architecture is not trained on such images

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

With deep learning based computer vision we achieved approximately 89% F1 score with our best Resnet-50 model with our first approach. Our second approach is promising too if we could build an extensive bounding box dataset for training the ROI extraction. Our solution is unique in the sense that we not only used deep learning for classification but for interpreting as well.

Human factor cannot be completely dissociated but we can substantial reduce human intervention. An optimal model is always a fine tune between FPR (false positive rate) &amp; FNR (false negative rate) or Precision vs Recall. For our use case, we successfully automated defect detection with a model optimized for low FNR (High Recall). Overall, on a batch of more than 2k new chips we are able to successfully reduce the human review rate reduction by 47%. With our case study we proved that we can automate material inspection with deep learning &amp; reduce human review rate substantially. Deep learning models have great generalization capabilities but its highly dependent on credible training labelled dataset.

**Industrial Maintenance:**

Todays trend of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increased level of Automation in manufacturing allow firms to flexibly connect assets and improve productivity through data-driven insights that has not been possible before. As more automation is used in manufacturing, the speed of responses required in dealing with maintenance issues is going to get faster and automated decisions as to whats the best option from an economic standpoint are getting more complex.

**Prescriptive Maintenance:**

Prescriptive Maintenance is a paradigm shift that fosters moving from a strict dependence on planned events to being able to take real-time action from actual events. Prescriptive maintenance leverages advanced software to pattern identification points to explicitly diagnose root cause issues and then indicate precise and timely actions to change the outcome in a timely manner. Industrial firms are using prescriptive maintenance and analytics software to reduce or eliminate unplanned downtime and maximize profitability and equipment reliability. AI-enabled Prescriptive Maintenance is unique in that instead of just predicting impending failure it strives to produce outcome-focused recommendations for operations and maintenance from analytics.

**Driving Up Productivity:**

Productivity is one of the three basic elements that manufacturers are seeking along with cost and quality. Today, theres an estimated $500 billion worth of machine tools in place to help firms manage their industrial equipment. However, modern firms are looking to go beyond preventive maintenance to enable prescriptive maintenance systems. For example, reduction of downtime is important for industrial equipment and machinery to drive up productivity and overall operational equipment efficiency. The OEE golden standard is only at about 80%. Exceeding these efficiency levels have proven difficult without manual effort or costly process.

   

**Digital Core:** 

A key aspect for implementing prescriptive maintenance and analytics is to include next-generation digital core technologies including AI, machine learning, IoT connectivity, collaboration and advanced analytics. These tools must be flexible, scalable, and easily integrated into legacy IT infrastructure. They allow organizations to integrate business process and transactional data from back office systems with massive amounts of structured and unstructured data from various sources. Advanced analytics can then be embedded in the data, on a timely basis, across the digital core enabling the organization to derive new insights, such as predicting outcomes or proposing new actions.

**Simulation and Flexible Modeling:**

Aggregating and ingesting data across a unified digital core is just the first of the requirements to achieve digital transformation. To optimize the outcomes from the transformation the firm needs to be able to collaborate across all areas of its organization. Virtual collaboration is increasingly becoming the standard for developing and maintaining excellence in industrial operational efficiency and increased productivity. There is a need to extend real-time, offline simulation and modeling to all participants in the data value chain including an interactive input capture from the technician feed and up to the reasoning and modeling for process and production managers in order to optimize maintenance decisions for physical objects. Annually, theres an excess of $75 billion worth of repair done on machine tools. A key aspect of maintaining these tools and systems allows individual modelling of recipes, processes, equipment, metrics and the customer specific syntax of its manufacturing process. These must allow for managing metadata, establishing data manifests that support fast and reliable processing of process and equipment data and injecting data classification and feature extraction to enable AI/ML algorithms. At the heart of Prescriptive maintenance systems is an ability to act and react quickly across the application and device components using advanced software that supports time-aware, synchronized execution for optimization and control of cycle times. Today systems are largely rule based and less flexible for a seamless integration of AI/ML results. Aligning data collection and mapping with machine learning results for actionable insights and completing automated controlled actions in milliseconds has not been possible before. Advanced analytics and control software unifies functionality from embedded systems, autonomous systems and platform integration without losing its industrial grade providing reliability and safety.

**Industrialized AI:** 

Artificial intelligence elements need to be embedded and synchronized on a deterministic basis in the data across the digital core enabling the firm to derive new insights, such as predicting outcomes and automating actions to ensure optimize the outcomes. 

**Advanced Analytics:**

The AI/ML system is the brain of a Prescriptive maintenance platform. ML models for production machines are designed to detect anomalous behavior during production. Training data helps to develop specific models for individual recipe steps or specific equipment types. Timely detections and prescriptions are accomplished by determining, on some continuous basis, whether a data point falls outside these bounds it is flagged as an anomaly and reported. Capability to train a new model and deploy on demand is the key. In doing so, the model is able to learn on and adapt over time

**Virtual Collaboration:**

Visualization of the large volume of data is essential to support managing the analytics and rapid decision-making for continuous monitoring and prescriptive maintenance and analytics. The visualization tool must synthesize multi-dimensional, often fused data and information in order to support assessment, planning and prognosis. The tool needs to be open, dynamic, real-time and available for all participants in order to be capable of collaborating with all participants to access data at various levels of abstraction and network connectivity.

**Case Study**

**Problem Statement:**

We go through multiple sequential steps for our component manufacturing. Our manufacturing assembly consists of multiple moving parts  most notably motion stages and actuators. One of the most elusive yield issues is intermittent motor failures that randomly occur over time. There is no recognizable consistency in the failure occurrence in terms of time, frequency, components, recipes, etc. They simply occur randomly. It is often too time consuming and negatively impacting our factory throughput to shut down the equipment to iron test out until one can luckily catch live a failure event. On the other hand, if the equipment stays online, it continues to manufacture faulty products intermittently, wasting downstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and high revenue loss. We previously relied on a manual condition-based monitoring solution and a preventive maintenance program that limited our ability to improve yield and productivity. Predictive &amp; Prescriptive Maintenance has been adopted recently in the heavy manufacturing industry. For e.g. Predictive Maintenance of a gas turbine, a Vacuum pump, an aircraft engine etc. These Predictive Maintenance solutions are highly custom in nature based on the machinery and its operation, domain etc. Further, the sensors used for these cases are geared towards large and heavy machines and are tuned for large magnitude speed, accelerations, rotations, inclination. Our manufacturing processes are quite different compared to the processes in the heavy machinery industry. Not only our domain and processes for manufacturing is different but sensor requirement for data acquisition would be different. Motors used in our component manufacturing are small in size and their motions are shorter in range and less sudden in order to handle delicate and small optical components. Off-the-shelf IOT sensors (used in heavy manufacturing industry for motion sensing) currently available are not suitable for our component manufacturing as they are too bulky to mount or not accurate and sensitive enough. For e.g. Movements causing excessive vibrations potentially leading to misalignment of a tiny component may not be detected by Off-the-shelf sensors.

**Our Solution:**

We proposed solution via an extensive solution requirement document detailing technical design specs such as  performance, scalability, modularity, security, high availability, connectivity, flexible application programming interface, CPU/memory / Network /Hard Disk usage specs, interoperability, configurability, reliability, availability, latency, ML / AI algorithms, database performance, visualization, extensibility, sensor requirements.

For e.g.:



https://i.redd.it/7nm5skb2za121.png

We partnered with a vendor who have the technical expertise to meet all our solution design specs. Partnering with the vendor we developed a predictive maintenance framework utilizing custom machine Learning techniques, software engineering principles with appropriate sensors chosen based on form factor, power, and communications protocol etc. more accurate for our component manufacturing. Overall, the predictive maintenance framework is able to perform real-time detection, visualization, alert creation as well as recommendations for fixes on different stages of our manufacturing process. This unique system also uses state of the art machine learning techniques and software engineering principles to preemptively and autonomously predict, detect, create alerts and recommend fixes on anomalous vibrations during component manufacturing process. This system alerts the personal and recommend fix estimations before any actual disruption of the manufacturing process occurs. This has enabled predictive and prescriptive scheduled maintenance of our component manufacturing process reducing sudden &amp; unplanned downtime/ disruption &amp; optimizing our factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. The platform integration of AI/ML, a time-aware runtime system and flexible authoring tool allowed a much better prediction of process and equipment issue and enabled precise maintenance of our equipment assembly avoiding sudden &amp; unplanned downtime / avoiding intermittent faulty manufacturing minimizing revenue loss.

   

**Major benefits we realized:**

Increased yield

Boosted worker productivity 

Reduced unplanned downtime

Optimized profitability

Rapid implementation

Quick scalability

**Overview of ML algorithms:**

**What is Anomaly detection**? **:**

Anomaly detection is about finding patterns (such as outliers, exceptions, peculiarities etc.) that deviate from expected behavior within datasets(s)  therefore it can be similar to noise removal or novelty detection. A pattern detected with anomalies are actually of interest, noise detection can be slightly different, because the sole purpose of noise detection is removing those noise. As with most data science projects, the ultimate goal of anomaly detection is not just an algorithm or working model. Instead, its about the value of the insight the anomalies/outliers provide  i.e. for the business money saved from preventing equipment damage. In the manufacturing sector  we want to proactively achieve predictive &amp; prescriptive maintenance using anomaly detection before it actually damage the equipment. This would pre-alert and enable scheduled maintenance avoiding sudden downtime which usually leads to heavy revenue loss

**Supervised vs Unsupervised:** 

There are two primary architectures for building anomaly detection systems:

Supervised anomaly detection  which we can use if we have labeled dataset where we know whether or not each data point is normal or not

Unsupervised anomaly detection - where the dataset is unlabeled i.e. whether or not each data point is an anomaly is unreliable or unknown

**Our ML Pipeline:** 

Our state-of-the art ML software framework performs real time sensor data acquisition from sensors strategically placed in various parts of our manufacturing assembly. All in real-time, our software framework performs statistical feature extraction from the acquired sensor signals, derive the principal components, and detects anomalous clusters (data points) using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, performs time series preemptive prediction on the sensor signals along with confidence interval guard bands and detects extreme vibrations. Following is an overview: 

 

https://i.redd.it/l4hod9g3za121.png

**A Sample Unsupervised Algorithm detecting various clusters:**

Mean Shift clustering aims to discover clusters in a smooth density of data points. It is a centroid based algorithm; it starts by considering each data point as a cluster center. Depending on the bandwidth parameter provided, each data point builds an imaginary sphere of interest. It then updates the centroid of the sphere with the mean of the data points within the sphere, then builds a new sphere of interest around the new mean (the new centroid), then again the update the centroid with the mean of the data points within the area. This process goes on iteratively until it converges meaning until the centroid does not move anymore. This is followed by a filtering post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids. The data points in the sphere that converge to the same centroid are considered members of the same cluster

The optimal number of clusters through each technique is achieved by optimizing the Silhouette coefficient. The Silhouette coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance (a) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) for each sample. The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b - a) / max (a, b). To clarify, b is the distance between a sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of. The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar

Following is a plot where Mean shift clustering detects various vibration stages of one of our manufacturing assembly components:

 

https://i.redd.it/hhlz3pc4za121.png

**Our Software Architecture:**

We have a flexible software architecture providing full capabilities at the edge as well it switches on-demand to a hybrid Edge-cloud based architecture based on data / ML compute needs etc. Our framework also provides a flexible API to update our ML models as needed. Following is our sample high level software architecture with Raspberry pie edge computer. We utilized Open technologies such as MQTT (real-time subscription-based messaging protocol), Influx db (Open source time series database for real-time analytics), and Grafana (for real-time visualizations)

 

https://i.redd.it/8wys7bu5za121.png

Due to various computation limitations from real-time data processing to ML training / prediction, we adopted a flexible software architecture that switches seamlessly to a hybrid form. The Edge-cloud framework continuously archive data into a historical archive database in the cloud in a rolling window, for e.g.- maintaining a week or a month worth of historical data up to the current date in a cloud database, the amount of data to be archived can vary based on the use case. The framework has in place a rule based model health monitoring system that periodically ( as well as on-demand) checks the performance statistics of the ML model - the performance statistics can vary based on but not limited to nature of the use case, nature of ML algorithms etc. If the model performance statistics falls below threshold values (such as f1 score, R squared for supervised learners , Silhouette coefficient for unsupervised learners etc. which can vary based on use case, algorithms etc.), the framework triggers the ML training pipeline (online) and deploy the newly trained model once the threshold criterion are met. Following is our sample hybrid architecture:

 

https://i.redd.it/sk25bgg7za121.png

**Prescriptive Maintenance real-time visualization platform:**

We built a state-of-the-art easy to use intelligent monitoring platform for Prescriptive maintenance. An operator can monitor anomalies, drill down to root cause and receive smart recommendations to fix a faulty situation during the manufacturing process in real-time. The ML based smart recommendations are based on anomaly behaviors, sensor locations, sensor data, time of occurrence, equipment types/ properties etc. With this platform, an operator can also effortless visualize &amp; monitor CPU, memory, Network usage etc. on the various manufacturing assembly servers. Our visualization platform also provides look-back options with custom date range. Based on demand and using the look back options the model health monitoring system in-place can direct an anomaly detection algorithm to re-train itself in the cloud with the archived history to better predict the future.

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

We developed a Machine learning based end-end scalable, secured, modular, extensible, interoperable, configurable prescriptive maintenance platform. With this platform, we realized substantial improvement on Yield for our component manufacturing processes. We are proactively detecting faults, recommending fixes for our component manufacturing assembly substantially reducing unplanned downtime and factory capacity, consumables, labor and operating cost. The science of anomaly detection is constantly changing. Our flexible ML API offered by our platform enable us to update our anomaly detection algorithms as needed.

Not sure if this is the right place to put this but I've got a question. I'm at uni doing a Data science masters, I'm also very new to Python. Basically, I'm looking at this: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) dataset for a uni assignment, in column 12 there's a lot of missing values denoted by ""?""'s which I have changed to NaNs. I've been asked to delete the rows of all the NaNs, delete a single column and also change the NaNs to the most frequently seen value in the column. So, my question is, how do I do this when the entire dataset are string values. np.isnan gives me this error: ""TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'' "" and I've tried pd.isnull which seems to get ignored when I put the dataset through the function. Would it be easier to one hot encode first and then deal with it? Below is my code for removing the missing rows.

Any help or guidance would be very much appreciated and again, sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. Thank you!

    def removeMissingRows(data): newData = np.array(\[\])
    
        for row in data :
            hasMissing = False
            
            for column in row :
                if (np.isnan(column)):
                    hasMissing = True
                    
            if (not hasMissing):
                if(newData.size == 0):
                    newData = row.copy ()
                else:
                    newData = np.vstack((newData,row))

I'm definitely going to pursue a career in analytics and i have been fortunate to have a few internships in the subject area so i gained some practical experience in both data analysis and data engineering. However I don't want to do technical work for my entire career. I know that maybe 6 or 7 years into my career i want to move into management within analytics, to leverage my social and business skills more. So my question is, should i be more focused on finding a full time role as maybe a product/ business analyst working on data problems, as these paths are more straight forward to management, or would transitioning from a full time data analyst/scientist role to management not be a problem.

Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning method used for classification, regression, and clustering as well. It uses a collection of Trees, where each tree votes on the outcome. In the case of classification, the forest gives the class voted by the maximum number of trees. In the case of regression, the output is the average of the outcomes of all the trees.

Suppose there are twenty different possible predictor variables. If you create a single decision tree, it may have some bias. Alternatively, in Random Forest, you choose a random sample of 4 variables (say) from all variables and build a tree. Repeat this for a number of times, say 10. Now, you have 10 different trees (lets call a forest) where different variables have been used and created different accuracy level.

Now, these trees give votes to each variable based on the outcomes, this gives a good idea about variable importance and finally gives the value of the predictor variable.

***Classification and Regression***

Each tree is given a sample of the full data set with replacement. A subset of features is used to create the tree to the maximum depth possible. The data points and features are then used to create the respective CART trees.

***Clustering***

The dissimilarity measure between the data points is used to create the distance matrix. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoid) clustering is performed on this distance matrix (using an input on a number of clusters) to create the final clusters.",1,1
