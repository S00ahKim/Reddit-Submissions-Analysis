&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to create a model for building's energy consumption based off of data over only a short time period (4 weeks) for each building, an example of what I'm working with can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/b6aCwOE). I'm looking into using an LSTM model but I'd like to try and incorporate some of the behaviors that are often present such as reduced consumption on weekends, common patterns over the course of the day etc. probably the most distinct feature is that there are often different consumption 'regimes', for example in the graph linked above there appears to be three different consumption regions which the building works around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on trying to do some feature extraction to work out which days the buildings are working and also look into deriving average consumption patterns over the course of a day before feeding them into the LSTM model, adjusting for the daily pattern and running separate models for working days/non-working days. The bit I'm struggling to wrap my head around is how I can work out what 'regime' the building is operating at for any particular time, any suggestions on how I could best do this or generally improve my approach to this problem would be greatly appreciated :)",1,2

I've been task with modelling a counting data and I came accross this model.

I have around 300k observations, with more than half being 0. The variance is much higher than the mean (13 mean, 14000 variance), which leaves me to be believe a poisson regression might not be the best fit. Nonetheless, I'd like to ask a few questions about this model.

The idea is to model the parameter lambda with our variables Xs.

What exactly happens in the prediction step? I have my observation x and I get the parameter lambda of my poisson regression and now what? I simulate a lot of values for this distribution and take the mean?

So I recently graduated with a PhD in astrophysics. I've known for quite some time that I want to leave academia and towards the end of my degree I tried to develop as many transferable data analysis/science skills as possible to hopefully make the transition into data science after. But... despite applying for a tonne of both data science and data analytics roles I've gotten zilch. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my degree I spent most of my time coding in C and python, coded a couple of numerical algorithms for the mathematical side of things to get a lot of my results, and used some regression techniques. I also used some bash scripting and Python packages (numpy, pandas) to clean my data, visualise the results etc etc. 

Other than that, due to the nature of the project I was given (which was a shitshow for many reasons, and I was not allowed to change it despite pointing the flaws out many times to my advisor) I didn't do much else in the way of data science/programming/machine-learning/big-data that many astro PhDs can usually boast about at the end of their degrees. 

Of course, my results and conclusions were enough to churn out a couple of academic articles (the requirement to graduate) and hey, presto! 4 years later: PhD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm at a loss what to do with my career - I didn't do enough stats and probability to go into analytics, not enough coding to go into software engineering, not enough machine learning to go into data science.

Does anybody have any advice on where to go from here? I'm thinking about doing one of those science 2 data science courses where they take in science PhDs and transform them into data scientists in a matter of weeks. What do you guys think of those? And can anyone suggest a good one?",6,4

I am hoping for a thorough critique of my resume to prepare for data scientist roles. A little more about me, I have a degree in Biomedical Science with experience in mainly life science-based data analysis except for my most recent role which is in finance/aviation. I have been programming for about 2 years in python, advanced in SQL and relational databases, and just beginning in R. I am taking the MIT MicroMaster degree in Stats and Data Science as a stepping stone to returning to school and hopefully fill in some missing gaps of knowledge of machine learning and statistics. In my current role I am able to freely use ML and have implemented a random forest and k-means algorithm with real data.

Ultimately, my main goal is to transition from data analysis to data science, although I am able to use DS techniques in my current role my main responsibilities are still data analysis oriented. 

P.S. My dream job is as a data scientist/python developer at NASA (I have been taking courses and reading text on astrophysics/cosmology) so any specifics on anything that would help with that would be great, but is not necessary.

First of all, please ignore my lack of knowledge, as I did not have a use case to run AWS before. I am using a powerful desktop at work. For my personal toy projects, where  I am working on Data Science and Machine learning - which laptop to get, does that matter? I even thought of running an AWS instance from work computer, but for privacy isses, maybe it is best to get a personal laptop on my own ( I am considering  a Thinkpad T480 and run a dual boot with linux and I am open to laptop/desktop suggestions to run AWS on my personal system). To summarize:


1. How can I learn more about AWS? (I am on free tier but my account was just charged even I have no EC2 instances set up yet)

2.  Do you see any disadvantage running my personal AWS project on a company work machine, in terms of privacy? If yes, could you recommend a laptop/desktop?

I am on the quantitative finance path so if you can explain in terms of finance that would make it easier for me to understand. I need to understand why we are doing this part of it.

In the course they state that weekly oil price data is a random walk, so we must take the difference of the data to normalize it.

 Now how does this apply in a real world application? How does this make me more able to read the data? Or we only remove the trend in order to apply ARMA models? How do ARMA models help me interpret  the financial data better?  Is it just used for predictions?

Yet another post by somebody asking if I have a background in this can I do this...!

Im pursuing a part time masters in Data Science next September in London and the course outline suggests students have the following pre-requisite knowledge: Assumed knowledge of first year university mathematics or equivalent (multivariate calculus, linear algebra, introductory statistics, probability) along with a solid grounding in Python. The python part I think I will be ok with since I intend to spend the year between now and next September teaching myself, including taking courses in Python for Data Science. My query is more around the mathematical component.

I recently completed then Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation which has a lot of statistics in it (as far as higher Econometrics, thats it) but aside from that Im not really great at maths. I found a lot of courses on Coursera and edx for Calculus, linear algebra and probability, so Im wondering if for the average person it would be possible to learn these concepts within one year? Of course, I know everybodys capacity to learn is different and Im expecting a very broad answer, but a general idea from this community would be really helpful.

For those interested, the Data Science MSc is being offered by UCL (University College London). My university background is in Economics. Also, with regard to Python I am currently reading Learn Python the Hard Way, which I intend to follow up with Automate the Boring Stuff and then hopefully begin my own projects.

If there are more than 500 elements on the page, then the script takes a lot of time to click buttons and then it also slows down in between the clicks after 300 buttons. The more it clicks, the more slower it becomes to click the next one.

https://i.redd.it/djfz84lqa9k11.png

The recurrent question in the data-intensive workplace often revolves around which computing infrastructure to use. In the past four years as a bioinformatics Ph.D. student, I have both received and offered solicited and unsolicited advice regarding computing infrastructures using my prior experience in high-performance computing lab and current expertise in data analytics. This blog post covers my experience in using private computing infrastructure as compared to adopting the cloud in bioinformatics/ data analytics, and the thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages.

**What are the main components in computing**

The major challenge I found was that: **The decision-making process of deciding between buying computing infrastructure versus adopting the cloud is very much like buying a car versus renting a car. The main challenge is the unpredictability of user usage pattern.** The moment I walked into the car dealer, all I saw were the shiny cars with a seemingly affordable price tag, and all I had in my mind was to get the car now so that I dont have to carry groceries back to grad housing for two miles whenever I go to Ralphs. Only till all the bills come then I know I am eating ramen for the next couple weeks and regret why the heck I bought the car. The immediate need of a car rushed me into the purchase without thinking about how often do I need it, and what kind of car do I need in the future.

It is the same game for finding the efficient and cost-effective computing infrastructure. The main problem in the story is that I am a poor graduate student having no money and I need to better utilize the limited financial resources to accomplish this goal. Fast completion time for the whatever demanding task requires expensive hardware, and like Ferrari, fast and powerful computing infrastructure doesnt come cheap.

Most machines have different RAM, hard disk, CPU, GPU availability. Like cars, certain vehicles cater to a specific group of drivers (Truck if you are loading) and there are types of cars that are close to one size fit all (Honda civic). Of course, there are also people love driving a pickup truck like they need to move every day, burning the double amount of gas without any extra values. Anyway, the point is that a misjudgment on resource usage can cause you extra without gaining more benefits.

**Renting (Cloud) vs. buying compute infrastructure is like renting versus buying a car:**

For example, identifying the appropriate RAM usage is one big thing, as swapping with disk can slow down the job turn around time significantly. But if you know are going to swap, you might want to have a machine with SSD hard disk instead of HDD. None the less, most machine learning, analytic and bioinformatics programs run within &lt;10GB RAM and some simple memory profiling using unix command *memusg* will tell you what needs to happen.

1. **The cloud is more like renting a car by the hour, achieving immediate goals without commitment.** For example, you want a fancy sports car to impress the girl tonight, and you went on Toru (car renting app) and found that renting a Porsche 911 for one night isnt too bad, its only $200. You got the girl with the Porsche. However, after the first date, the girl expects you to drive her around in the Porsche 911 every day, and after a year, you found out that it cost you $73,000 which can already buy you that car already. The on demand cloud instances can burn through the bank if you are not careful. For example in Amazon cloud (AWS), continuously running an M4.16xlarge on demand elastic instance can cost \~$1,000 per month, which you can buy a similar machine with $1020k. None the less, the AWS now offers spot instances, cheap availability of idle computing power is slowly changing the game. Some of my colleagues told me that they were able to achieve close to perfect availability with 10X cost reduction using AWS spot instances and 99% availability, where the only time they struggle with availability is during the online shopping seasons.
2. **Cloud computing enables simple and yet diverse configuration of security, network, compute and storage instances.** My experience of using the AWS as compared to traditional SGE and TORQUE computing ecosystem here is that AWS is highly configurable in both how the computing nodes behave together and within itself. For example, I could easily set up a secure virtual private network and file storage in a day, as opposed to negotiating for weeks with the supercomputer center on the logistic of moving the computing nodes into a private network.
3. **Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image + p3.16xlarge = deep learning magic**. For machine learning tasks, the AWS offer instances with up to 16 GPUs and images with the CUDA and common data analytical python libraries preinstalled, like *pandas*, *keras* and *tensorflow*. Those beefy machines alleviate the need for writing distributed code which can take weeks to months, and this turns out to be a huge advantage. Also, the environments issues became much more straightforward. For example, the CUDA static object libraries have versioning extension which screwed up the dependencies when I tried installing *tensorflow-gpu* on shared computing infrastructures. Moreover, all the computing infrastructures I have used so far hesitate to modify the computing environment, which is often the bottleneck in the development process.
4. **Private compute infrastructure maintenance is annoying**: During my years in an HPC (High-performance computing) lab, we used to maintain the cluster ourselves, and the cluster was hosted within the office. And whenever someone submits a job to the cluster we can feel the heat wave from the cluster. We also tried to be smart and save on the all the compute infrastructure except the CPUs and had a ghetto way to stack on machines without much consideration for the heat dissipation. The frequent death of the machines translates into frequent maintenance, which was a huge headache.

**Finally, check your code before checking the hardware:** Aside from computing infrastructure, the other significant problem towards efficient computing in data analytics is the lack of algorithm/software knowledge when people first come in. In the car analogy, if the person wants to go from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time, doesnt matter how fast the car is if the driver thinks the steering wheel is a gaming controller and the volume up button will propel the car forward. I have come across some data analysts that have a minimal amount of algorithm knowledge, who thought without any software configuration/optimization, simply running on more machines will speed up the process. I have also seen many published data analytical software that could be hundreds of lines but somehow they ended up a hundred thousand lines. I am not trying to say we should stop people who didnt ace all their algorithms to write code, as I do believe that everyone can learn and I have seen many biologists that could code fantastically. My argument is just the field could save so much time if most people could learn some basic linear algebra and algorithms before they start playing around with Big Data. For example, in the case of table IDs mapping, could be done with a simple sparse matrix multiplication using an existing optimized matrix arithmetic library, instead of writing distributed python to loop over each ID.

These are just my opinions, hope you learned something, feel free to leave comments and thoughts.:)

AB testing and dashboards.

If the role is asking for prediction and inference modeling experience plus experience with techniques like linear regression, NN, and random forest . Guess what you are likely to do?

I work for a mid-size medical device company and we do not have any type of data science department. The most we rely on are R&amp;D scientists who use their typical statistics, a marketing insights team, and a data analyst in the customer service dept (just generate queries/reports for sales transactions). I am in a unique group that does technical support and I generate my own ""projects"" to support internal/external customers. In previous projects, I would create VBA macros and queries to tap into our sales data, SQL databases (production data, returns, materials processing), complaints and thus generate some useful insights (EX: probable return rate of new product launches, medical diagnostics, root cause analysis through data logging).

Most recently a PM asked about a decision to obsolete a feature and I was able to provide a report showing the lack of engagement for it and that eventually got visibility of the higher ups on my skills. Since then, I've noticed more people coming to me for data help. 

**At this point, I'm wondering if I should make the case to our Directors of building a Data team to support the various functions of our company from R&amp;D, Ops, Marketing, and Sales so we can provide them the type of insights that would help us be more innovative and efficient.** 

However, I do not see myself as any type of data scientist, especially when reading about the type of work you all do! I have an a M.S. in Engineering and at a Senior level position, but my exposure to data science has been limited to the Microsoft edX curriculum. I was initially interested in the course to be more efficient at Excel but it eventually spiraled into the Data Science curriculum and I'm currently learning Python/ML.

I wonder if I'm being a bit too hard on myself for simply not having the technical expertise yet, but that my strengths are motivating leaders to buy into the vision of Data. Based on this exposure, would you: 

* Recommend that I continue the data science journey, learn on the fly, and enroll in more formalized courses?
* Say that I'm not really advocating ""true"" data science, but just a glorified data analyst with potential of doing science?
* Suggest becoming a PM to build a group and hire experienced data scientists
* Advise me to Give it up, you're not really doing any of it at all!

It's tough for me to compare because I've never worked for any company with a robust Data Science team. Additionally the structure of a Medical Device company is so different from Tech/Product company so neither of my trusted colleagues would know either.

TLDR: given the current DS job-landscape, do you think it's more important to have communication skills or tech skills? That's a simplification, here's my full question:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice.  I think I am in a similar position as many data scientists, so I'm hoping people here can relate to my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me: I'm early in my career (YOE: &lt;5). I work in a large DS department (100+) and we are specializing our department (less ""unicorn"", now more focus on specific skills). As such, I've been given an opportunity to move to a more technical role or a more client-facing role.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always focused my personal development towards becoming the ""unicorn"" --  maximizing the 3 pillars of DS as much as possible: math/stats, computer science, and business/communication. I believe this was the best way to bring value as a DS in the past 5 years (and may very well continue into the future). Personally, I'm strong in communication &amp; math/stats, weaker in programming (R whiz, but everyone here is production-level python &amp; spark). While pushing so hard to become the unicorn, I've learned to love every part of it. My ideal role is building the end-end product/research -- build a data pipeline (CS), build a model (Math/stats), and evangelize the results (business/communication). This is what my role is now! At the end of the day, though, I have a choice to make and must choose between these pillars. One more thing I should note: I personally enjoy these 3 pillars about the same and ""personal enjoyment"" is less important to my decision.

&amp;#x200B;

SO, with that background info, what would you recommend? What would give me the best options in the future? What is the *ideal* career path for someone in my position? I'd love your advice for my situation, but I'm also curious about your thoughts on the DS-industry as a whole and the balance between tech/soft-skills.",3,3

The latter uses free-text, which is why there are so many input values.

Currently, I build these two models independently. That is, the weights of the lower-dimensionality inputs for model A are developed independently of the higher-dimensionality inputs for model B. However, the inputs really should be considered dependently (or rather, *not independently*) in the ultimate model.

What are some strategies for combining these inputs? My first thought was to just tack the text features (the width-5,000 matrix) onto the lower-dimensional features, but I'm not sure whether that could present problems with the overall modeling exercise.

So basically I am sort of lost of what to focus on and when. My first 3 years of college I figured I would just end up doing software/web development and so I practiced that with side projects/websites etc. 

Now, I decided I want to pursue data science/analytics. However, my side projects now are not related to data science jobs and I am still brushing up on statistics/linear algebra. 

So I am not even sure if I should even bother applying to data jobs this Fall or attend my career fair coming up, since I feel I don't have enough credentials yet. Furthermore, I have heard that is really hard to get a data science job out of college and also many are masters/phd students. So I am not sure if I should aim to get an internship first instead of a job. Or if I should go to grad school. Yeah, I just don't know what to focus on this coming Fall semester... 

I am thinking that applying now would be sort of pointless as I have no credentials for data jobs. If I work on it this semester and have some project and knowledge by next year then I can start applying a lot in the Spring. Thoughts?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

I just want to pick everyones brain on a subject that I've been toying around with in my free time. 

Given a data set - how would you determine, give one entity, which other entity or entities in the dataset are most similar.

I like beer, so the example I usually use is hops: 

Name|Alpha_Acid|Cost|per|Pound|Aroma|Purpose                        
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--                                  
Hop1|3%|$10|High|Finishing.
Hop2|10%|$3|Med|Bittering.
Hop3|2%|$25|High|AllPurpose.
Hop4|9%|$12|Low|Bittering.

In short, if I feed in HopX - I want to know that (for example) Hop1 is most similar and Hop3 is 2nd most similar based on selected features. 

In my ELI5 mind, the simple way to approach this is going to be assigning the qualitative variables a dummy/quantitative variable and build some kind of predictive model, then probably feed in your control entity and see what is near by. I've been exploring the use of KNN for this - but is this the optimal approach? 

Are there any packages or models in sklearn or anything that would be a better path to explore? How about general theory/whitepapers/articles onthe subject.. 

TY in advance!",4,0

Going to sit down with some of the combinatorial multi-armed bandit math in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.8339.pdf and see if its useful to us. Their work seems pretty fucking nuts tbh. We use a neural bandit to handle combinations of prices, which seems to perform pretty well relative to other implementations of combinatorial bandits, but obviously once you move away from pure math strategies and you just let some NN handle everything, you lose the ability to prove mathematical efficiency which scares me a little.

I've spent a long time reading in the subreddits and getting informed and now I finally wanted to ask you guys to help me out.

About my situation: In a few weeks I will start my Master's degree at a European university in Economics (Major) and Data Science (Minor).  The university is known as a top-tier university in Economics, so I chose this major mainly because of the reputation of the department and my huge interest in Economics.  Unfortunately, I'm still unsure whether I'm putting obstacles in the way of landing a data science rather than a data analyst job.  The major in Economics is very quantitatively oriented, especially in the statistics department.  I am not sure, however, whether it would be better to choose DS as my Major, although this degree would not be quite as prestigious as the Econ degree, considering my chosen university.

Another option would be to go in the direction of quantitative finance (similar to a MFE in the US).  This was also my original plan and I was admitted to the programme after a rather heavy application (only about 15% were admitted to the programme out of 250 applications).  However, I quickly noticed that the curriculum was more focused on probability theory, risk management and derivative pricing (like black scholes, etc) - so I think I would lack many skills (especially in programming, but also in statistics) which I could learn much more in choosing Economics coupled with DS. Unfortunately, the quant programm does not include any minor to choose from and is highly specialized in mathematical finance.  It has to be said, however, that the Quant Finance program is extremely renowned in Europe, so the educational signal would be very good, but at the expense of the content of the studies, Im afraid.

I would be very happy if someone could give me some advice on this decision, whether an Econ Major with DS Minor (or vice versa) would make more sense, or whether I should go towards Quantitative Finance to land a decent DS job.",2,1

I only applied to a few jobs and it gave me some options. There is a remote job where the manager likes me and wants to move quickly for a contract position. I would say it's certainly a step or more down but there are benefits to being remote, having work quickly after separating from a startup, and a normal 40hr/week job that would give me time to build up the skills to get back into a data scientist role again, hopefully. I would still be a data professional but not in tech and not working with programming languages in any substantial way- mainly collection/organization/light analysis from what I hear.

Then, there is another I'm interviewing for that is a permanent with benefits role (although I have them through my SO already) where I would certainly be happy but they are very picky on fit and have been hiring for a long time. It is a small tech company. HR seemed to like me and I will speak with the hiring manager after the weekend but it's only about a half step down from my past DS role. It's a mix of Python, R, and SQL with SQL being the primary language, but I'd still be working with real-time data. However, it wouldn't give me as much time to work on side-projects, is a longer commitment, and has a commute of \~30-45min by public transit. It would push a DS role much further out (3-4yr?) compared to 1-2yr at most after leaving the contract.

The second role is a normal hiring cycle and would take an extra week to find out about so I'll be in a position to decide whether to risk it and apply to more perm roles or take this contract with nice people at a good firm that is remote. What would you do in this situation?",3,2

I was working on  the data camp exercises and I'm am plotting bivariate and multivariate data sets. One of the examples had us plot a correlation matrix in R. The arguments specified  under corrplot( ) allows us to change the method ( ""number"" or ""color"" )

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Color"" shows the circles w/ the size of the circle showing the correlation ( larger the circle the closer to 1 it is) 

It also uses a color chart for correlation

""Number""

Uses the correlation value  and color  

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyway I can combine the two?

Have a  color circle representing the correlation with the actual value of correlation inside?

 ( the combination of the two images below ) 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think the combination of the two would be better represent correlation visually

The main reason is that it is open source and free which is great and many courses are teached in python and R and people tend to stick to the tools they know. That is definitely true for me, I got in touch with Mathematica during my undergraduate studies and later switched to Matlab and then during my PhD back to Mathematica.

I know a little bit of Python but nothing of R. 

I guess at some point I need to learn more about python because of tensorflow and the fact that it is used in the cloud. But I would rather learn Julia instead...

So here are the reasons why I think Mathematica is a great tool for data science:

1.) Everything is included from the start, no poorly maintained and documented libraries you need to load. Which also means that it is consistent. Its consistent over domains, but also over time. [30 year old code still works.](http://blog.wolfram.com/2018/06/21/weve-come-a-long-way-in-30-years-but-you-havent-seen-anything-yet/)

2.) I like the interactive notebook interface, which they actually invented. (I know of Jupyter)

3.) Symbolic and numeric: just use whatever you need

4.) [functional programming:](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/FunctionalProgramming.html) You can program in any style you want but if you want to be efficient with Mathematica it gently pushes you towards functional programming

5.) [build in knowledge](https://www.wolfram.com/knowledgebase/) (similar to Wolfram|Alpha): which means its really fast to test Ideas. For example in your raw data you have a City Name. Which on import is interpreted as an so called ""Entity"", and you can immediately plot its location or get its population or get to which country it belongs and so on.

6) The whole ""Dynamic"" and  [Manipulate](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Manipulate.html) functionality. Just wrap you boring plot into Manipulate and you get an interactive version of it. In a similar way you can also make complex GUIs but that is needs more effort.

7) [the documentation](http://reference.wolfram.com): Is in interactive notebook format and well organised and in one place.

The negative side:

\-) It costs money. In order to deploy code via so called Enterprise CDF you even need a yearly subscirption of about 1400USD per year (which also includes personal support where you can ask how to solve a specific problem)

.) The everything is a Symbol approach can make debugging  hard, since computation just doesn't stop. You can get a result of Sqrt of an image. Which is great but sometimes not what you want. But I found a good solution for that.

.) locked to one cloud vendor: wolfram. I can not easily deploy my code on google cloud...

.) all online courses, papers and so on use something else

.) hard to recruit people who know Mathematica well

So which of those things can R or Python or Julia do, and how well?",7,0

However, I don't even know how to begin parsing this data. The CMS data is in a CCLF format which looks like a container that contains multiple files. Looking at the Python code, the CCLF files are containers of multiple data files, some headers, and various relational data tables. Problem is, the data looks like it is fixed width columns (according to the contractor), which aren't consistent. So you have to manually find out the width to parse it and that changes each data pull. Kind of puts a damper in the ETL process. I don't even know how to pull the files into R to poke around and have done most of the figuring out from reading the contractor's python code. ",14,0

I want to come up with some ways to be able to answer marketing questions such as:

""What products should we be pushing to our customers?"" (up-selling)

""How can we improve customer retention?"" (contract renewals)

""How do we close more deals?"" (increasing revenue) 

Because I've never dealt with data like this before, I'm hoping to get some pointers on how best to start. I've already the scrubbed the data so I have some ideas but feel like I'm lacking in either the quality of the data I have or the skills to utilize what I have effectively -- or more likely, both. 

I hope to be able to do some kind of simple customer classification and from there, identify product trends and ultimately be able to recommend products based on that model. So that given a customer, I can say that this customer fits closely with X Group which is seeing a growing popularity in Product Y and should be referred to Partner Z for the best chance of closing.

My understanding is models tend to be pretty robust due to small random errors, but this doesnt seem to be small, and Im not sure if its random. Do you have any recommendations on how to clean the dataset? 

The option were currently pursuing is iteratively running a classification model and reviewing the cases for which the model is very confident but incorrect according to the training labels.

I am very new to DataScience, but I already love it.

I am currently working with some user posts from a german online forum about diabetes and wanted to do a sentiment analysis (SA) with the data. I need some advices / hints on how to do proper SA. Since this is a project with a deadline, I have about 10 weeks &amp; limited manpower (only myself). My general goal is to get any kind of useful information &amp; opinion about medication with help of SA.  Ideally the results should contain some detailed opinion about something like the aspects of the medication. 

My first attempt was to do an aspect-based analysis with machine learning (CRF).

1. aspect term extraction
2. term categorization into pre-defined categories
3. sentiment analysis / classification)

With a list of \~200 medications, I extracted all sentences, which contained a med, annotated some of them and tried to train a Conditional-Random-Field model for sequence labeling. (which was the most promising way based on literature review). I extracted about 8000 sentences and annotated around 1000. I annotated the aspect terms (and the term category they belong to, but thats not relevant). All non-terms are annotated as ""0"". Only about 250 of the 1000 sentences had any aspect terms. The remaining sentences mentioned the medication, but the topic of the sentence is something completely different.

I knew that this small size of data wouldn't work out with ML approaches so well, but I tried the CRF anyway. The CRF had different features like POS-tag, lemma, uni-/bi- / tri-grams + their POS tag / lemma.... 

The recall of my model was way too low (\~0.3). I tried 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 50/50 training/test split and even hyperparameter optimization with the python sklearn crfsuite. my model had 2 labels to ""choose"" from: \_aspect term\_ and \_0\_. With my trained model, I tried to label the aspect terms of some sample sentences. All predicteds were incorrect. In my opinion the main problem is the sparsity of aspect terms in my annotated data in relation to non-terms, as well as the size of annotated data itself. I briefly looked into some of the remaining 7000 sentences and they also didn't look very promising (in terms of potential aspect terms). So I'm thinking about doing the analysis on a ""higher"" level. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current idea is to the SA on sentence-level with lexicon based approach. First, I extract all posts which mention a medication. After that, I could extract the sentences (inside the posting)  which mention the medication + following sentences via some kind of anaphora resolution. Next, I would use a dependency parser and a manually constructed sentiment lexicon to calculate the sentiment.  

It would be nice, if I could also filter the sentences into categories like in the aspect-based approach. Maybe, I could filter them by special words/ phrases about sideeffects or the effectivity / dosage, which appear in the same dependency subtree as the medication? (I am still thinking about this)

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently doing some research about how to implement this and if its a good way of doing SA. Maybe you can give me some advice or point me to the right direction :) ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In fact it seems that a lot of their benefits could be automated or augmented by data science. On the renter side the advantages of a broker - basically recommending new places that fit within some criteria could easily be partially automated using ML. On the landlord side the posting+application process could also be heavily automated (e.g. listing photo/text preprocessing, doing automatic credit checks, computing matches between landlord/owner and renter, predicting probability of paying rent on time etc. etc.).

The options are:

**Complex analysis**

This module develops the theory of functions of a complex variable, emphasising their geometric properties and indicating some applications. 

**Applications of probability**

Discover how models can describe the occurrences of events - from a gambler's ruin or the positions of plants, to the spread of an epidemic.

**Optimization**

Examine techniques used in numerical analysis and operational research to represent real optimization problems as mathematical models, to be solved with a computer. 

**Deterministic and stochastic dynamics**

Fundamental concepts of dynamics, deterministic dynamics and stochastic processes and diffusion

**Graphs, networks and design**

This module is about using ideas from discrete mathematics to model problems, and representing these ideas through diagrams, showing anything from chemical bonds to transport systems.

Don't take this as an insult to the group; its an observation.

I suffer from an inability to make decisions and actions, therefore even with clear guidance I struggle to pick a starting point and stick to it. One major contributing factor to this is my compulsive need to read all the ""getting starting,"" articles possible, and the threads that go with it. And while I understand my short comings regarding picking a starting point / plan. Others seem to be having the same problem who may or may not have as much industry knowledge as I do.

In every article there are 2 maybe 3 views, coding, the math and DL:

- Without fail theres always the guys who say just start playing with it, find a dataset you like and find a problem you want to solve and go. I liked this approach and started this way. :)

- Then the comments start on this thread, where its identified if you don't know the math, you are doing it wrong and you don't even know it. ok... makes sense... buuuuuut do I keep chugging along with my project or start taking math courses (overly simplified response but you get the idea)? This is where my spiral starts, and now I'm watching videos on statistics, how to read research papers, taking khan courses on statistics and coursera courses on ML; all while trying to do my project that got me really into this in the first place.

- Then comes the deep learning discussion, ""if you really don't know how do use the right algorithm, its not even worth trying."" Which in my mind is really the same discussion as the math comment but further down that road. 

I don't know if its an opinion of those who do it for fun vs professionally vs academically (or of theres a difference between professional &amp; academic). Its just hard to pick a starting point when the opinions are so vastly different. I know I know, its the internet - but data science is the search for truth within the numbers, maybe we can collectively agree on an approach. Even if its professional vs fun.... Academic I will assume starts with school and ends with school...

My opinion from what I have read thus far:

Professional:

 - Make sure you have a strong understanding of statistical distributions 
 - Make sure you atleast have a foundation of high level math: linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics...etc
 - Hypothesis testing and optimization
 - Python / R / SQL / other coding basics
 - Algorithms and training data
 - Start your own projects via kaggle or similar
 - Build your own data set via gathering, cleaning and normalizing and create models / predictions to prove a problem you find
 - Do the above a lot until you have enough to quantify your knowledge on a resume
 - Apply

Fun:

 - Get Math
 - Have coding understanding
 - Know what an algorithm is and how to apply it - read about how it works at some point
 - Follow a Kaggle or similar, tutorial a few times
 - Try an example yourself or find a problem to solve for youself and start

I think of we dig into this and let each group define data science we'll find that while there's a good deal of overlap they aren't the same.

For the academic definition of ""data science"" I'm sure many would say you really do need a PhD to adequately perform some of the tasks, so when that group says ""you need a PhD"" it's not an attempt to gatekeeper but rather give people realistic expectations.

On the other hand there are probably ""data science"" roles for which you don't need a PhD, and it's important to not confuse the two.

That said I'm sure a lot of hiring managers aren't great about distinguishing the two and it seems we aren't either.

That's just my take though. I do have some formal machine learning education (which is ongoing), and when I think of data science I believe it requires the ability to do self-guided research which puts me in the more academic camp.",22,9

I have also always heard that knowledge of R is virtually required to do anything in data science, though a couple of the degrees I've seen do not provide exposure to R.

Do you think B.S. degrees in Data Science are legitimate?  Or are the universities trying to capitalize on the hype by offering a program that might not actually teach you the right skills?

Unfortunately, tSNE, as currently implemented in the most popular packages (scikit-learn and MulticoreTSNE), is prohibitively slow when dealing with large data. A recent paper proposed Fit-SNE, which scales linearly w.r.t. the number of samples, but depends on the FFTW C library, which must be installed on your system, making installation and distribution very tedious.

The goal of this project is to provide fast implementations of both tSNE approximations (both Barnes-Hut and FitSNE) in Python with a unified interface, easy installation and most importantly - fast runtime.

This is also the only library (to the best of my knowledge that allows embedding new data points into an existing embedding, via direct optimization.

So pretty much I got assigned this problem for a new role I'm being considered for at this new job and I'm unsure about how to go about it because I was not given any data. I'm supposed to forecast into the next 6 months to a 1 year.

The question is: ""How large is the market for short term **furnished** rentals in ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ city"" ? Please estimate the number of stays per year and support your projections with data"". Also, short term rentals refers to renting a unit for 1 month to 1 year.

A few problems I keep running into are:

\- I wasn't given any data at all on past rentals in this specific city. So I guess I have to search the internet for data to use, but i'm not sure where to find data on past short term furnished rentals. Maybe AirBnb?

\-I'm unsure on what type of forecasting model to use, but I probably need the data first before I can choose a model. I'm gonna assume there is some type of seasonality, (more people renting in the summer than winter).

What I've thought about so far:

\-Finding the total population in the city, and how many tourists it gets per year. Also how many new people are moving into the city every year. Because these are the types of people I'm assuming that would need a short term furnished rental.

\-Find industries of growth in ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ city"" and particular demographics/income of new residents/ visitors.

Finally got a script to load the files, group them by CCLF#, bind the rows, and apply the proper column widths and headers. What I realized after this is that 5 of the 8 parts have incorrect number of characters per line. For instance CCLF1 is supposed to have 177 characters, but the files have 11 characters. The column is likely an unused identification number. Has anyone dealt with this?

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to think of the easiest way to deal with this. I thought maybe adding a row to my dictionary for a column called ""random\_11\_spaces"" with a column width of  11. Then I'd check to see if the files have the correct number of characters per line. If so, I'd add 11 spaces in the correct locations, bind them together with the other files, apply the column widths and delete the extra column. Just not sure if there's an easier way to go about it.",2,2

2. Should I connect to some kind of platform/engine that automatizes all different possible calculations? (Don't know any...)

Over this summer I have gone to a few data science meetups in my local area. Some advice I picked up was that I should do a master's with a work placement, as ""it's hard to get your foot in the door but after you do it's much more easy to get employed in data science"".

Is it worth doing a master's in Data Science to get a work placement, specifically doing data science. Or is it worth looking at other master's courses with work placements less focused on data science?

I would say at this point my coding skills in Python are quite strong, but am lacking knowledge in computer science areas, such as ML and databases. I would like to develop my statistical skills further however.

Uses embedding representation for each paper: you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easy to run in Google Colab",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9fykmx/hey_rds_i_made_a_research_paper_recommender_for/,Research2Vec,1536983550,"I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg


###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

Insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

Of course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project.

.

I cannot take any programming classes (no electives left because of my previous degree) and only have room for 1 stats class.

Additionally, I had a look on hiring websites and they are generally looking for math, physics, computer science and engineering majors who are proficient in Python, R, Java, C++ etc (obviously not all, but just listing languages).

If I just learn Python and Java by myself, will be able to find a job after a graduate WITHOUT having to do further studying ie masters/PhD

Im taking a coursera class on Machine Learning and were going over linear regression and gradient descent. In the first assignment, we are expected to program each algorithm using their formulas with the ultimate goal of finding values that would minimize the cost function. 

Prior to this class, I looked over some machine learning stuff on kaggle where they used a built-in function, using scikit-learn, that did everything for us. 

Is the linear regression model using scikit-learn the same thing as programming it by hand?  Are there any benefits of using one method over the other?

Sometimes I have come across the situation where I can take various approaches (taking the mean/median of the column, grouping by a parameter and then taking the mean/median, grouping by another parameter and taking the mean/median, etc..).  


Obviously some of these approaches will work better than others, and I was thinking that it would be useful/cool to implement some sort of cross validation function in my script which I can call on various imputation strategies. It would be something like:

&amp;#x200B;

for strategy in imputing\_strats:

for each fold:

take some percentage of non-nan values in column, define as ""test"" set.

impute values for these rows as if there were a NaN there

evaluate imputing strat performance by comparing imputed values with real values.

imputing\_strat\_performance = mean of performances

&amp;#x200B;

For each strategy we would have a performance measure, and we could just take the best one.  


This is something I have never seen done in Kaggle kernels/elsewhere and I'm wondering why that is. It seems that a lot of people just try out an imputation strategy and hope for the best, whereas this would be more robust.

I'm looking for a little guidance on an example from a Data Science book I'm reading.
Recently I purchased a humble bundle with the O'Reilly data science books and have started reading ""Thoughtful Data Science with Python"". I've reached Chapter 4 on Naive Bayes Classification and am thinking about the example the author provides.

You can see the chapter [here](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/thoughtful-machine-learning/9781449374075/ch04.html) (This link is legal, I believe).

I'm feeling very confused about where result values come from and so far I have reread this section 3-4 times, slept on it, checked the errata, read it again and am no closer to understanding the authors results.

Here is the section in question:

&gt;Remember that the probability of fraud was 10%. Lets say that the probability of gift card use is 10%, and based on our research the probability of gift card use in a fraudulent order is 60%. So what is the probability that an order is fraudulent given that it uses a gift card?

[Formula](https://imgur.com/a/7lO8Yaz) 

&gt;The beauty of this is that your work on measuring fraudulent orders is drastically reduced because all you have to look for is the orders with gift cards. **Because the total number of orders is 1,000, and 100 of those are fraudulent, we will look at 60 of those fraudulent orders.** Out of the remaining 900, 90 used gift cards, which brings the total we need to look at to 150!

&gt;At this point, youll notice we reduced the orders needing fraud review from 1,000 to 40 (i.e., 4% of the total).

This section feels like the author is drawing conclusions without enough information, but I suspect that is just me missing something. My thinking is if we have n=1000 orders, P(Giftcard) = 10%, P(Fraud) = 10% and we know P(Fraud | Giftcard) = 60% we would expect 100 orders to use giftcards, to check them and then to find that 60 of those were fraudulent.  This leaves 900 more orders with us expecting 40 of them to be fraud but we've already checked the 100 gift card orders, so I'm not understanding...

* How the author seems to just find 60 fraudulent orders in the first 100 checked
* How the author has 90 gift card orders left over in the last 900 

I hope this question isn't stupid but I really am not getting this example. Any help would be much appreciated at this point so I can move on from this section.

Whatever the reason, it's important for businesses to overcome the mental roadblock in order to know more about their customers, streamline existing company operations, manage company risk and compliance, and make informed strategic decisions. So how do you learn to trust data?

Start by following the four anchors of trusted analytics: quality, effectiveness, integrity, and resilience.

It's used in **many** fields and has come a long way with technological advancements. With that being said, I was surprised to learn that people are unfamiliar with the different types of data analytics. There are four types of data analysis that are used across all industries and while we separate them into categories, they're all linked together and build upon each other. 

The first, most basic type of analytics is called descriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis answers the what happened by summarizing past data usually in the form of dashboards. Then we move into diagnostic analysis. Building on descriptive analysis, here we dig deeper into ""why did it happen?"". Predictive analysis comes next and answers ""what is likely to happen?"". Finally we end with prescriptive analysis which combines the insight from all previous analyses to determine the course of action to take in a current problem or decision. Each type of analysis is important and ultimately depends on what you want to gain from your data.

Making the career field transition from GIS to Data Science/Data Engineering. I'm a master's student at Georgia Tech in City &amp; Regional Planning. I wanted this degree to give me more background for a career in urban analytics. 

However, I've become super involved in Civil Engineering-Transportation Systems Engineering because I work in that department, and because most of the classes overlap with the Transportation Specialization I'm doing in the city planning program. I really enjoy applying my technical skillset (heavy in GIS, I code but only a bit right now in R, Python, learning HTML &amp; Javascript) to transportation problems, whether it be public transit, traffic, or freight problems that need solving. 

My issue is this: I am burnt out from doing school straight through, for my entire life. I've been hustling/working hard while doing school simultaneously, for a long time (6 years)...in addition, I forced myself to complete a terribly difficult program in high school (plus 4 years, totaling 10 now) because it was the only opportunity I had to get out of the rural town I come from. So yes, I'm tired. 

I also have Asperger's Syndrome, so I completely obsess over new topics I get interested in (such as transportation engineering or data science). This often interferes with my ability to prioritize and make important career moves. For example, I should've learned programming years ago, but I didn't know how to get into it etc. so I procrastinated until about a year ago. 

I'm at a point where I need to decide whether to pursue a Master of Civil Engineering-Transportation Systems (only 6 more months of school after my first Master's graduation in May), or just walk away with my city planning Master's and start working in the field. I'm on the fence because 1) I'm really good at what I do and I think the 2nd Master's would build upon my growing skill set, and help me become someone who stands out and 2) I think the title of ""Engineer"" is more fitting to what I do (don't get me wrong, making a decision like this just because of a title is pretty stupid) and 3) I'm tired as hell!

Here is my degree trajectory....can't outline my various related jobs here, but I've worked enough in the planning and GIS fields in BOTH public/private sector, and I'm only 23. I've gotten a ton of GIS experience from working in industries like: tourism, consulting, economic development, local county government, software development, transportation, regional planning, climatology and fluvial geomorphology). If you happen to be an employer reading this, feel free to 1) hire me and 2) drop me a line :)

Bachelor's Double Major: Geography (Geospatial Information Analysis) and Political Science (International Relations)

Master of City &amp; Regional Planning- Transportation Specialization

(potential) Master of Civil Engineering-Transportation Systems Engineering

&amp;#x200B;

Would it even benefit me to have the civil engineering master's? Like I said, it's only 6 extra months. I have no CS background but I've literally been teaching myself and I've been very successful (not trying to sound like a know-it-all). I'm conflicted also because I get a ton of job offers via LinkedIn in GIS fields, but none of them pay in the bracket I'm realistically aiming for. I've clearly worked my ass off to get out of the trailer park and into the white collar world lol. I know my worth.

I'm a software developer in the Bay Area with 10 years of experience, been in ""big data"" for the last 5 years, with the last 2 years being on an actual Machine Learning team. The company I work for isn't FAANG, but right behind it, and everyone has heard of the company. 

I'm trying to decide whether to start applying now, or, since I'm enrolled in a Masters of Statistics degree, wait another year after getting some more statistics courses under my belt.

I guess the positives are:

* Experience working on many different types of models, but mostly on the engineering side. Thankfully we are using the latest engineering infrastructure/ops techniques, and everything is on AWS, which is pretty cool.
* Models I've worked on include decision trees, linear regression , logistic regression, simple neural nets(not DNN). My current project is training hundreds of different models a day and pushing them into production. AUC, Logloss, F!, Precision Recall is awesome!
* That includes getting the data, feature selection, training models, evaluating, and monitoring on production for performance. I've done my fair share of trouble shooting, and have a healthy respect for making sure our models are valid.
* Pretty extensive data engineering experience. Hive, Hadoop, Spark etc
* I'm not an amazing engineer, but am just naturally curious and solid I guess. Did a ton of Java and Python. I've been burned enough to have a healthy respect for good architecture and testing.
* When I struggled and studied the math behind, say Logistic Regression, and it made sense, felt a pretty huge rush.
* 2 months into an online Master of Statistics(not applied stats), at a decent public university. Love the subjects!

Cons are:
* Very weak statistics backgrounds, which is why I'm taking the masters
* Lack of experience actually choosing correct models for the problem and training them. Basically lack of experience actually leading a project as a data scientist.
* When I try to read ML papers, I do get lost in the stats portions.
* While I can follow along and discuss modeling techniques, when the subject turns into stats, I get lost.
* The current manager of the data scientists is... lets just say I've seen many data scientists leave in anger, and even the current ones are very mad. Every single one of them say he has very little data science knowledge. 
* The aforementioned manager is also the yell at ppl type, not the hey bring somebody new and I can train him type. So an internal switch to Data Science is very unlikely. 

I'm a pretty easygoing guy, and am very close with the data scientists. They all tell me to not underestimate myself and just go out there and apply for data scientist positions. But I just don't feel good enough.

So could I start applying? Or wait a year until I get a year of stats courses under my belt and can read ML papers with little problem?

Any input would be awesome, and thanks in advance!!",14,3

I'm working with some HR data where the goal is to understand what the driving factors behind absenteeism are, as well as to develop a predictive model to identify enployees likely to be absent in the following month. 

The target class is of course skewed in favour of no absenteeism, approximately 90% vs 10%. The steps i have taken so far are to develop a random forest model and use the in built variable importance functionality to get an idea of the key variables. Based on this, I will dive deeper into these key variables to carry out more visual and statistical analysis on the relationships between them and the target.

I used the raw, unbalanced dataset to build the model and as a result it does quite a poor job of correctly identifying absenteeism in the test set, despite a classification accuracy slightly better than the underlying class balance (~91/92%).

My question is, if my model performs poorly at identifying the target category of interest (absenteeism), how much, if any, trust can I place in the variable importance rankings? I understand that the variable importance rankings are based on removing the variables from trees and measuring the decrease in accuracy, but if those trees do a poor job at identifying the category of interest, does that then mean that their estimation of the important variables are invalid in terms of their relationship with the category of interest? Does that rubbish my plan as using the variable importance functionality as guidance on which variables to investigate further?

I understand that over or undersampling should improve my models ability to identify the target category of interest, and I plan on doing that, but this was a question which popped into my head today and got me thinking.

I would appreciate any guidance you guys can offer me on this problem, and I hopefully phrased my question in a comprehensible way

I want to eventually manage teams of analysts and be the best in the world at what we do. For arguments sake assume I am in the top 1% of applicants. Now the problems/questions:

When I do something I put 110% into it and, as I said, strive to be the very best I can be. Because of this I have poured myself into my work and havent paid attention to other fields that might interest me. To me, solving complex problems is what excites me, and I dont really care if it is the optimum number of taxis in Cleveland or the value of the price of a stock. To me it can sometimes become the same question. 

I plan to leave my area of research and enter the private sector. I have many reasons to do so and will omit them for now. So the question I pose, which field(s) should I consider moving into? Perhaps now that I have given some context I can ask more specific questions as well:

1. What is the most desirable data science positions currently?
2. What are the best companies to work for as a data scientist?
3. What fields are the most Wild West currently with plenty of room for new ideas to flourish?
4. What fields offer the most advancement opportunities?
5. Which fields offer the ability to make the most money? 
6. Which industries/companies offer the most work remotely positions, and which avoid employees working remotely. 


Obviously everyone can only offer their perspective, but any insight may be useful.

I am working on designing a graph database for a project, and I need some advice or resources on how to design and implement the structure. I have done some initial exploration using ArangoDB (I am currently in favor of this one, but open to different ones if there are any suggestions), but I wanted to learn some best practices to ensure that the graph can be easily expanded upon and explored.

 

**Background**

I am fresh out of college and started my first job as a data scientist and am looking to expand my knowledge on data representation and exploration. 

**Data Structure**

Some of the data we are using is proprietary, so I have to be intentionally vague about the actual details but will describe the data in a way that is similar but not identical to ours.

We have a variety of entities, including: Organization, Organization Locations and Organization Members. 

An organization can have multiple locations, those locations can have multiple offices within them and those offices can contain multiple members. The organization can have associative relations with other organizations, a location can belong to multiple organizations an organization member can interact with other organization members as well. 

 

**Goals**

Use the relational database for the allocation of resources for the organization members. The group that allocates the resources is a 3rd party that connects businesses in the supply side of things to the organizations. So, some of problems we might face would be inferring that an organization member is actually at a location and has a certain need for certain resources. 

Once we have the overall structure done, I have plans to utilize Graph Convolution Networks for some fraud like classification, however we are in the early stages of that and need to specify the questions we want to ask some more. 

   
 

**Looking For**

Case studies involving similar entities in which graph databases were utilized. 

Best practice advice for designing the graph in Python.

Graph framework recommendations

Further resources for graph database design, implementation and usage, such as books or academic papers.

504,2018-9-20,2018,9,20,0,9h62f7,How should I structure a big data cleaning workflow?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9h62f7/how_should_i_structure_a_big_data_cleaning/,cornucrapia,1537370436,"Hi everyone,

I have a model that requires pretty comprehensive data extraction and transformation and I'm trying to figure out the best way to structure my code.
There are a lot of good resources on overall project structure, like [production data science](https://github.com/Satalia/production-data-science) and [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) but their example data cleaning steps are all simple enough to fit in one function, so they don't really address my issue. I'll describe my current workflow below and hopefully someone can give some suggestions to improve it or point me to some resources. This is all in python, but I'm guessing the problem/solution would be reasonably similar in R.

The first step is to get raw data from a query to a data warehouse. I have a function get_data() that takes a DW connection object (sqlalchemy engine) and some date range parameters and returns a pandas DataFrame.
The next step is some basic transformations on that data. A second function, first_transform() takes the dataframe from get_data() as a parameter, does some string cleaning, recodes a couple categoricals, and other simple cleanup and returns a DataFrame.
Next there's a first level aggregation function first_aggregate() which takes the DataFrame from first_transform, aggregates the data, does some more transformations at that level and returns DataFrame.
Finally there's a higher level aggregation, final_aggregate() which takes the DataFrame from first_aggregate(), aggregates it to a higher level, does some transformations, and returns a DataFrame.
Above all this I have a wrapper function that calls the get_data, first_transform, first_aggregate, and final_aggregate functions in order, passing the result of one to the next and returns the final DataFrame.

So to some extent this modularizes my code. I can do some basic tests at each intermediate output and get a sense where issues might be. It's also a bit more readable than one giant module or function. But it still has a code smell, or at least I think it does. All the subsequent functions are useless without the input from the preceding ones, so its still really just one big linear process. Given that in reality the final result I want really does depend on this sequential processing of the data, maybe that's the best I can do, but I feel like there's a better solution or design pattern that I just don't know the keywords to search for. Does anyone else have a large data processing problem that they've developed a better workflow/design pattern for than I've outlined here?",7,14

My skillset aligns with the qualifications asked of most entry-level positions (Proficiencies in R, Python, C++, SQL, ML,  Data Mining, Data Visualization/Reporting, Advanced Statistical Analysis, and so on..). However, my biggest obstacle seems to be my lack of professional industry experience as most ""entry-level"" positions list that they want 3-5+ years of industry experience. 

The question I would like to address: With only an undergraduate degree in Data Science how can I build professional industry experience to find myself being legitimately considered for entry-level positions?  

Some solutions I've considered:

- Working Independently on projects (thinking Kaggle Competitions) and adding them to a personal portfolio to send to recruiters along with my resume.  

- Applying to startups 

- Starting with an internship (This is less than ideal as nobody wants to intern post-grad but is coming closer to being a reality) 

If anyone else has suggestions or solutions to add it would certainly help me and hopefully others in the future.

I'm about two years going on three as a 'data analyst' for my local city government; my official title is Project Coordinator (lol) since they don't have that classification at my jurisdiction.  I do a lot of daily reporting through Excel and have automated many of my reports.  I do a lot of data cleansing manually (-_-) because our back end has tons of issues that we...outsource to a 3rd party developing company that uses an older data warehouse (I hate you siebel).  Although the red tape gets mind numbing sometimes.  At one point I was trying to learn Powershell so I could automate my automated VBA scripts.  I'm pretty good excel, access, tableau, and SQL (but it's been a few months).  

There's not much room for growth both in terms of job responsibilities nor pay (at least as not as quickly as I would like).  I'd rather be learning python/R and investigating our data more deeply and in cooler ways instead of just querying out bad aggregate data, cleaning it, then regurgitating out as a simple chart/table/report on a regular basis.  I have no background at all in statistics nor no much about AI/machine learning.  Everything I know was learned on the job and basically self taught.  

I am pretty interested in furthering my career in data science, and have read books that definitely get my interests piqued (Dataclysm, Everybody Lies, Automate the boring stuff with Python).  I wouldn't mind doing more data base architect stuff, business intelligence, hell even software developing.  I have M.S. in engineering (bioengineering), and live in Los Angeles,CA if that has any weight to the responses.  

I guess after all of that I'm trying to ask what to do.  Do I keep applying to jobs currently (although I feel like I should do it more aggressively).  Get a degree/cert in data science? Work on something data science related outside of work? What have been your guys' experience developing your career? ",3,2

Trying to apply a simulation to a business case where we are evaluating multiple projection scenarios for a power rate in a specific region. I'd like to use monte carlo to have a better understanding of what the P50 CAGR of these rates are over 20 years. However, I'm new to running something like this, and it isn't abundantly clear how I would go about doing it.

The data is hourly, and for now, I have two projection curves: a base case and a low case. Can extrapolate 1-2 more from other area that correlate. These curves are professionally produced by top consulting firms, and incorporate a variety of scenarios (policy environment, etc), so I'm hesitant to use historical data (am I wrong?) as a comparable set of values.

Curves are produced hourly, but I think I would plan to look at rates of change on a monthly scale.

How should I think about setting this up and what would be my the sequence of getting from where I am, to having a probabilistic sense of the expected CAGR? And/or any good comps to review how to do something similar to this in pandas/python? Googled around but most things either looked somewhat irrelevant, or went over my head altogether.

I know there are loads of these posts but I really hope I can get some feedback from you folks. Im thinking about pursuing a career in data science, but I dont know if its a real possibility for me or if I should expend my energy on something else. Id love to read your opinions.

Ill finish my PhD in animal behaviour in 2 years. Currently Im ok at statistics (do applied stuff, use small-ish datasets but am unfamiliar with mathematical proofs), comfortable with R, good at finding/interpreting scientific information, and good at communicating findings.

To pursue a career in DS, I plan to take a bunch of online courses and read books to match what's on the curricula of MS-DS degrees. I've also toyed with the idea of doing a 1-year specialization in applied statistics (evening classes) that I can take for free at my University. It would help cement and somewhat deepen my current knowledge on inference, multivariate stats, experimental design, etc. The downside is I would have to take it during the last year of the PhD and it could get hairy graduating from both programs at the same time.

Would the stats specialization actually be useful during a job hunt by way of showing that I have some formal statistical education, or would it be on par with certifications from online courses? Should I develop some sort of portfolio of projects to compensate for my lack of formal education in DS? Or is there something else I should be doing? And, more generally... **do I have a real shot here or are there too many CS/ math / stats/ etc. graduates for me to compete with?**

.

Additional info which may or may not be useful: Live in Mexico, but will leave as soon as I finish my studies. Cannot afford to pay for a degree, unless mayyybe an online one thats like 1,000 USD, like a MicroMasters. I'll finish the PhD with \~10 published papers on animal behaviour, although that may not help at all during a job hunt (?). I do intend to finish the PhD, otherwise I have to pay back all my scholarship money. The main reason I considered DS is because it seems like something one could potentially break into without the relevant STEM degrees, and that pays well.

- I could simply create dummy variables/one-hot encode for the zip codes.
- I could merge a public database which has information on zip-code level. This database includes stuff like crime rate, demographic info (ethnicity, age distribution) death/birth rates, density, number of cars, etc.. (this database has ~50 columns).

30 mins - culture fit

1 hour - Technical skills + Case/Problem Solving

30 mins - final check with hiring person

Firstly, I was wondering if someone could lay out some questions or specific technical knowledge I will need to have. I am an engineer who graduated in the spring and I have taken data analysis courses but I would like to do some targeted studying for the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I have almost no experience using SQL, but I have used R in passing and Python extensively for data analysis projects in the past. Would it be worth my time to learn some SQL and if so how much should I know for the interview? I already passed a coding test but it was array manipulation and not a lot of analysis so I figured it might come up.

So, I am not a data scientist but I am aware of the power it holds to leverage data sets and drive decisions inside a business. First, I'll describe my business. We are educational consultants offering advice and guidance to people from different geographies over whatsapp. Over time, we have collected text-based conversational data for the same. Our conversion rate from a lead to a client is about 5-7% and I am looking to make our sales process more efficient. What I have noticed over time is that people who dont reply with a lot of words up until a stage of our pre-determined sequence of conversation, end up not being a client and are usually not serious about the product. On the other hand, people who take their time and write detailed answers until that specific stage of the conversation end up being a client. Leveraging the text files that we have containing conversations with all the clients from a specific geography, I want to establish a criteria for that location and come up with a number(representing number of words) that helps us prioritise serious customers over non-serious ones. For example, we start by 10 words or more in 20 replies or more until a specific stage of the conversation. We run this criteria through all the client conversations to check how many fulfilling it. We then tweak these numbers to maximise the number of people that fall in this criteria. With a big enough data set, I believe I can come up with these two numbers ie number of words (x or more) in number of replies( y or more) that will help the process of sales be much more efficient. We can then use this criteria to put our attention to those people that are really serious, as shown by their willingness to reply in a lot more detail and lower the priority of the ones who dont seem serious  
 

Now I have come up with this with a basic knowledge of statistics and computer science and I just need to be pointed in the right direction. I would greatly appreciate any kind of help or guidance on this. I have probably not done a great job explaining the problem so please feel free to ask any questions you guys might have.

I know this has been asked many times already and some of you may have answered this before, but I just want to get a direct answer/advice from people in the field. 

I am an English major, was doing my masters in linguistics when war broke out in my country. I tried to stay, but after several close calls, I had to leave before finishing my Masters. Long story short, I got an admin job at an NGO in another country. After a while, I got interested in analysis; thus, I volunteered to assist, which later on turned into a full-time position.

Data sparked my interest and I started researching more about the subject. I had to move to a different country and there I started learning the basics of programming. So far, my coding and SQL skills are good and I know my math pretty well, all of which I am continuously improving. (I actually enjoy Math) 

However, my concern is the degree-relevance. Maybe start-ups do not care as much, but big companies do. I cannot do masters right away because I need extra CS/Math credits to be able to do masters in Computational Linguistics for example. Also, I cannot afford it at the moment. Kind of aiming on landing a job as an Analyst at the beginning.

I'm forcing myself to think to valuable uses of data science techniques (machine learning) for tool/website optimization when it is not about standard KPIs such as sales.

For instance, let's say we have an app that is used by employees of XZY. There are no sales or 'standard' B2C metrics tu pump up, but efficiency of the app itslef (loading times, ease of usage, ecc.). Where is, if it exists, the added value of data science in such scenario? 
The only thing that comes to my mind is predicting features usage, but that information is situationally valuable.

Hi all,

Im looking for some inspiration from you guys. Based on below description, I welcome all suggestions as to how the most interesting research question, problem formulation, and/or hypotheses might look in your eyes:

&amp;#x200B;

Im doing a Big Social Data Analytics project (university, graduate level) where Im going to fetch text (posts, comments, comment replies) and engagement (likes, shares, reactions etc.) associated to each post from a case companys Facebook Page over a 5-year period. I do have unique actor/user IDs as well. 

The project is conducted with a large brewery that is currently using its Facebook Page for getting its marketing messages across, but it has never done e.g. sentiment analysis on its posts such as what types of posts receive the most negative sentiment (perhaps do less of this), and what types of posts receive the most positive sentiment (perhaps do more of this). The tool I use for sentiment analysis can analyze both emotions and whether the post/comment is generally positive, negative or neutral. Besides this, I have a tool that can analyze what are the top keywords being used on the brewerys Page and perform topic modelling out of it. 

I also have access to the brewerys sales data for the same period as well as weather data, if I would think in examining potential correlations between Facebook performance, sales performance and weather (low/high temperature, low/high level of mm rains etc.), and potentially use it for predictive analytics as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Im planning to use nothing more than Alteryx, Excel and Tableau for data preprocessing, and visualization. Looking forward to be inspired with interesting ideas!",0,2

At the moment I have a not great pc (i5-5, 8gb RAM, Intel HD graphics) so I was wondering if it would be convenient to buy a new top pc (a MacBook for example) or to subscribe to the Amazon service.

Here are my thoughts

Pro of AWS:
-learning how to work with AWS will be necessary in the future, I suppose, so I'd just save time doing it from the start
-it would probably be cheaper to rent the AWS computational power

PROS of PC:
-having a top pc and running programs locally would allow me to use tools without depending on the internet
-WiFi connection (in my flat) has given me troubles in upload, so sending huge databases to AWS seems almost impossible to me.

Finally a last question: even if I choose AWS, am I supposed to buy a new pc anyway?

Decay events can be observed only if they occur in a window extending from x = 1 cm to x = 20 cm. N decays are observed at locations {x1, . . . , xN }. What is ?

Think racking and stacking, switches, access point. I'm pretty good with Linux and some now decent level of networking. I'm also familiar using some analytics software to the extend like AppDyanmics  and LogTrust. My job was more focused around setting up these for clients than using these, although I know little about using them too since I got sales and pre sales certifications. 

My other work exp including working as sales associate way back, in an eletronic store selling TVs, then in retail for something, then tutoring while in college ( highschool level math)

I'm not a pro with Python but I have built some small level programs and extension for other software. Same with Java. And I'm pretty good with LaTex as well. I'm also familiar with Excel (more than basics) but I'm improving on these by online tutorials. I also just started doing the R course thru datacamp. 

I keep looking at entry level positions and most of it require ppl knowing SQL, Tableau, R, Python, SAS and Excel. I'm really not sure what to focus on to make my chances for find a job go up. Doing everything at once is kinda overwhelming!

I'm kinda unhappy with my current job as it leading my into things I'm not really interested with. I'm more interested in data analytics and science.

I kinda feel burned out about not finding a job yet, plus no one has gotten back to me despite the tons of postings I've applied for, it's kinda demotivating. But I really don't wanna blame the world for it and that's why I started working on the required skillset. How could someone with my background be a strong candidate for the entry level jobs? I know I fucked up by not having any internship on my resume while in college. I was struggling with college and other personal issues, didn't think I could handle it back then.

Any help directing me to good resources, practices or how to make my self a strong candidate for these kinda jobs is appreciated.

This thread is a weekly sticky post meant for any questions about getting started, studying, or transitioning into the data science field.

This includes questions around learning and transitioning such as:

* **Learning resources** (e.g., books, tutorials, videos)
* **Traditional education** (e.g., schools, degrees, electives)
* **Alternative education** (e.g., online courses, bootcamps)
* **Career questions** (e.g., resumes, applying, career prospects)
* **Elementary questions** (e.g., where to start, what next)

We encourage practicing Data Scientists to visit this thread often and sort by new.

He instructed me to work on the following problem and interview with him on Thursday.

So, the problem is about last mile delivery. Logistics companies such as DHL, UPS etc. can spend up to 35 % on last-mile deliveries. A key problem is the call center has to call the person to get the exact delivery location. This increases costs.

Instead, we can feed the address into a geocoder and get the coordinates. (Geocoder: A software which takes {address or points of interest} text as input and spits out latitude, longitude). This is still expensive as Google charges per API call. Obviously, we cannot make a new Geocoder (Google et al has already done a lot of research; Why reinvent the wheel?).

But, we can structure our software in such a way that can reduce the number of API calls to Google to reduce geocoding costs. We can save money by integrating our historical database (address-geocode records) with the geocoder.

The hiring manager suggested on looking at solutions to:

1. Check if two addresses are similar (Eg. they may belong to the same building but have different apartment numbers). We can use historical geocode records in this case.

2. Since, we have millions of address-geocode records, how do we structure or cluster them in a manner so that the search space therefore search time is reduced?

3. If Googles geocoder fails to find a match; how can we modify the address such that we are able to get a match in the second try?

Currently, I am looking at string similarity algorithms such as Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, TFIDF, Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler, Affine Gap etc.

I'd get trained for 6 months in python and R and I already know a good bit of SQL through my current role.  This is the direction I want my career to take and have only been considering the CPA as I'm told by everyone it's great to have and will open doors.  However, I'm not sure the doors it may open opportunity wise are the doors I want to go through. 

 I've always wanted to move more towards data science type role and currently work as a financial data analyst, working with databases to bring in data for financial analysis.  My question: Is it worth it to continue studying for the CPA?  I know the path I want to go down career wise and have a good idea how to get there.  I would like to go back and get a masters in CS but before that, there's some core concepts/skills in cs I want to brush up on and get better at.  I want to know if it's worth even studying for the CPA or if my time would be better spent working on skills that would actually help in data science.  

Off the bat, I'm sure some people would say to forget about the CPA and focus on programming/other skills that would be more applicable.  However, I want to know that the CPA wouldn't provide much value before I just abandon that.  Everyone around me says to go for the CPA but it just seems like a waste of effort when I'm really not interested and don't care much about the opportunities it would open up.

Obviously one of the first steps in a DS workflow, before getting to the fun parts, is to do the exploratory data analysis, usually this has a number of goals (usually, but not limited to):

* Outlier Identification
* Identifying necessary data modification/wrangling
* Multicollinearity
* Assumptions (distribution, linear relationships, transformation?)
* High level variable selection
* Other...

For the most part, I (and I assume many others) just do the basics - boxplots, scatter plots, examining the data structure in a dataframe or similar, run some basic statistics, etc...Obviously it will be data and case specific each time.

But for those who have had more exprience, what is the workflow that you generally follow for the EDA. Which visuals do you usually output, which ones do you focus on the most, any cool packages that you have found that help you along or that really streamline specific parts.

Thanks for all the comments for my previous question regarding the video interview. I have my onsite for the same position 2 weeks from now. From the information I have, I know there are 4 rounds - Product Interpretation, SQL (technical), Quant and Applied Data. the first 2 topics I am familiar with as the video interview was on those grounds. However, I have very little clue as to what to expect for Quant and Applied Data. I also was curious as to how does Applied Data differ from technical and product round as the description sounded similar so i wanted to understand what is the specific thing that they are looking for within the rounds. Even with Quant (Statistics &amp; Prob), a few example questions that I did find on glassdoor I have been working on them, but it'd be great to know what are the best approaches for such questions so as to deliver well on them. I have not given a quant interview in my previous interviews so I am very unsure as to what to exactly expect and how to structure an answer well so that it is well received. 

I'd greatly appreciate if you guys can be my interview mentors and give me advice from your experience and knowledge so as to prep my best for these!

Been lurking for a while here now. I recently entered a data science masters program in our university, and while thesis is still a long way off, we were suggested to start thinking of thesis topics as early as now so we can get the ball rolling. (It's also part of a course on research writing I'm currently taking).

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Is it correct to assume that in a lexicon-based sentiment analysis, a big factor on the success (accuracy, F-score) of the analysis relies on the robustness or accuracy of the lexicon used?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it worth it creating a new lexicon for a non-English language? Are there significant challengues in making this lexicon bilingual? 

&amp;#x200B;

Motivation: While English has a number of open source lexicons, I didn't find a lot for my native language, hence I thought it'd be an interesting research topic.  I'd like it to be geared toward social media as well since our country is one of the biggest social media users in the world (percentage of total pop). This will also open up more analysis for our country that's specific to the bilingual use of our native tongue with English. The challenge here is it will have to be more or less manually constructed. I was actually inspired by the VADER lexicon and how it was built, and how it used humans to verify/check the lexicon used, and its results.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, just to pick people's brain here, is this a worthy research topic? I'm a bit apprehensive because I'm very new to the field, and the research and conference papers I'm reading all seem very impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

So group 1 might have 55 stalks above a certain height, group 2 might have 80...

Is it appropriate to run a regression model with the response variable being the number of stalks in each group above a certain height, and the predictors being amount of sunlight, water, and so on?

If not, what's the best way to determine the significant variable among water, sunlight, and so forth. In addition, I also want to find the optimum combination of water, sunlight, and so forth.

I need to determine whether a soldering quality is ""good"" or ""bad"" based on human labeled images. There are multiple solder points, and any bad points would fail the part.

For each PCB, there are two images. One is a natural light image, and another is an image that shows the topography (height) information.

I'm thinking about using Naive Bayes model as that's easily interpretable. I wonder how you can make the Naive Bayes model more conservative, in that it'll very rarely make a bad part pass. I also wonder if it's necessary to find an ""anchor point"" in the image (say, the corners of the PCB) first, because the PCB might appear in different locations from one image to the next. I think tilting, shifting will affect the Naive Bayes model. Please advise.

Also, what about neural networks for this problem? Does it still suffer from object tilting/shifting from one image to the next?

The question was to get an average of a count, this required a subquery, now I realise just after my interview that my syntax was wrong (the query would not work if put into a terminal) but I manage to write my answer as an avg of a subquery in which I was getting the count of this nominal measure.

Generally, correlation is the initial step to understanding relationships and eventually building better statistical and business models. To gauge the strength of a relationship between variables, we use a **correlation coefficient**. The correlation coefficient, a value between -1 and +1, tells us how strongly two variables are related to each other. A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and a correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A correlation coefficient of 0 or near 0 indicates no correlation i.e. no linear relationship between variables can be noticed. Pearsons Correlation Coefficient (PCC, or Pearsons r) is a widely used linear correlation measure. Its often the first one taught in many elementary statistics courses. [This tutorial](https://dataschool.com/finding-correlation-in-data/) on finding correlation shows the formula for PCC and uses it in an example.

c) they are just west 20-50 miles (within psychic range) of the HIV nests

d) those cities match the top 25 HIV cities also

e) their topics they talk about are even worse!

Reddit has a subreddit with r/censorship with 200,000+ complaints about people deleting their research.

These people need to be questioned, or arrested. And asked if they are hearing voices, can think clearly, have been alien-abducted, or if god told them to delete stuff.

\*Note: I just used a few hours to do this, if you added all the words its probably more damning. I also included the mods subreddits like r/gangstalking, and also r/conspiracy, and r/worldnews, and the mental health subreddits bipolar and schizophrenia, it was about 250 mods. If you use the API for all the subreddit names XXXXcancer and XXXXhealth, you can get even better results.

&amp;#x200B;

other topics that are deleted from all forums:

\* mind controlled girls, missing girls, mental\_issues reports from college (see school shootings)

\* missing girls and human trafficking and satanic sex abuse

Hacker news also deletes everything interesting

We currently look for ""eroding"" customers by looking at the individual customers average days between orders dates in a test period (last 30 days) vs. their average days between order dates in a Sample period (prior 12 months to the Test period) to identify who is beyond their typical buying pattern. We also compare daily spend averages in both periods to see who is behind in what they typically spend. We do this through crunching fairly large amounts of data in a SQL database. 

It seems to work OK but not it's not perfect. We identify customers are significantly over due to order and significantly behind on typical spend so we can market to them. However, we don't do anything to a control group and notice a significant chunk of them ""naturally"" do start buying again, which is actually expected because we identified them as customers that should have been ordering by now. 

We're looking for ideas in different ways in isolate/find these customers that ""naturally' return so we can focus marketing to the others. Does anyone know of any better tools / articles / ideas / anything that would help us improve our process?

Specifically, Im looking for a data scientist position that will let me apply my advanced statistics skills.  My current job and my last job told me Id be doing interesting data science work, but all Ive been doing is basic descriptive statistics, plotting, and some coding.

In almost three years of professional experience Ive done one advanced analysis, which was shortly after I entered the work force.  The company I was at was vastly unprepared to hire a junior data scientist, providing zero mentorship and being actively opposed to anything more advanced than basic statistics.  I built a predictive model at the request of my boss on a small amount of very noisy data (to the point where some of my coworkers told me there may literally be nothing there).  Project requirements changed almost weekly.  At the end of the process, I made a very basic recommendation that would vastly improve an internal metric while involving very little work.  The response was were going to ignore you and not do anything.

There were also many other times when wed have a long, drawn out, manual process with a potentially useful data-based solution.  Id make a very reasonable suggestion (like we should look into this) and my boss would berate me.  A superior once pitched a cluster analysis for customer segmentation and executives vetoed it because it sounded hard.

I acknowledge that there things I needed to do to ensure that the model I built went well, including the importance of setting clear, written expectations in the beginning and saying no to some requests that made this model a bigger pain than it needed to be.  But the actual environment was a massive hinderance.

How do I best explain that the only modeling project Ive done as a working professional led to no internal changes?  Because when I mention my suggestion for how to use my results, the follow-up question is always what did they do?",3,1

Now i was lucky enough to be offered several positions for my first real job in the field. As great as this is, a lot of them sound great actually and I am a little overwhelmed what to choose. So first any advice for what to look in my first role?

Secondly, I have been weighing the issues of one specific issue: is it better to start at a consultancy or be an in-house data scientist .

As a consultant I think I could learn a lot due to having lots of projects and experiencing many different companies. However, I worry that I will be lost at the customer and I might lack the opportunity to gather long term project experience. Also I hear it can be difficult to acquire the data you need. Also those consultancies told me if i don't like my project for whatever reason I will usually be able to switch.

In-house is pretty much the reverse. I will get to take ownership and apply myself deeply within one project and among my coworkers. I will also probably be able to work more dynamically and fast-paced. But maybe at the cost of all this being one-dimensional. Also if the company sucks after all, I can't just switch project.

So far I am leaning in-house.

I am wondering if there are any approaches for augmenting input for neural networks with contextual data.

I am working with trying to find a way to predict the distance between the surface and bedrock (which lies some distance directly under the surface) based on electrical resistivity values from the ground. So for example consider the case where you have 10 data points, distributed across a line, and you want to predict a depth value for each of them. Since the data may be somewhat noisy, the left and right neighbors to the data point you want to predict may be able to augment the prediction of that datapoint.

I assume one way of doing this could be to just expand the input field of the neural network to take as input not only the datapoint that I want a depth prediction for, but also the two closest neighbors. Hopefully the network would learn during training that it is the middle datapoint that is of highest importance. But will this provide improved results?

Another approach could be to compute a new datapoint being the average of the current point and its neighbors, and use that as input.

Are there any other ways to do this better? Or are there any other ML models that may fit this problem statement better?

I guess the core of the issue is that I want to introduce some spatial contextual awareness into the predictions, not only predict the point based on information solely from a single datapoint.

Any suggestions as for literature to read or other approaches would be greatly appreciated!",2,2

To do that, I was thinking of providing some data analytics services for free to this company. The sell is that I can demonstrate the value of leveraging their data to extract insights at no cost in exchange for the ability to report/ communicate the value-add on my portfolio for future reference.

Since this exploratory for me, I don't have a model to charge for these kinds of services. Offering it for free makes it a nearly zero risk experiment for the company. However, granting access to lots of their data might be the source of their biggest apprehension.

Is there a contract that would help immunize them from malfeasance to assuage any worries about how their data will be used? I want a way to strongly communicate respect for their data and its privacy to make them more comfortable providing it to a consultant. 

Any other advice for establishing this kind of business relationship would be incredibly helpful.   They are a family owned company so they're tightly knit. The fact that my girlfriend works there might add some social credibility, which might be the largest factor in the success of this kind of arrangement. 

Thanks in advance. ",2,3

I have been given extremely large csv worth 63 GB of raw transactional data to work with. Data resides on our server and I am using a linux box to conduct my analyses. My issue is the fact that R loads data into memory however, I know for my analyses I don't need all of that data at once. The issue is with the data wrangling and cleaning step. I know there are invalid fields in multiple of the columns. But not sure how to remove them in the complete 63 GB file. Is that any Unix script for data cleansing step? I was thinking of doing anti join beased on the transactional ID I filtered out. 

Regarding analyses, is it still feasible for me to do so in R or does python deal with memory issues better? I know R has packages FREAD, FF, BIGMEMORY but 63 gb of file is ... Sqldf keeps returning errors regarding disk. I am not a comp sci person, I did stats hence the rudimentary questions above.

My hypothesis is that revenue is linked to these indicators. However I also want to include how the type of government in place at the time (ie RED for labour, BLUE for liberals) impacts business confidence and thus company revenues.

We have an election coming up and our CEO wishes to know how a change in government party may impact revenues in the short term. He wishes to know how different variables will drive revenue changes (what if GDP shrinks by 2% you).

I have tried a simple linear regression in Excel / R, but it is very hard to prove any good, linear relationship. In addition, I am not sure how to overlay the party colour (categorical variable) into a single, multivariate model.

Logistic regression on time series data with all of the above to a single dependent variable (sales volumes). However can I include both quant (ie gdp) and categorical variables in a logistic regression? Are there any good (simple) tutorials in R or Python I can follow?

I am working on a playground Kaggle Competition (Titanic) and ran into a problem when using the predict() function on a new data set.

The goal is of course to train a model on a training set and to then predict values in the test set. When training the data, I don't want to use all available variables, but rather exclude some of them. When I simply enter all desired variables into the model by hand, everything (including predictions for new data) works fine:

`log_mod &lt;- glm(Survived ~ Age + Fare + ...)` 

The problem arises when using "" \~ ."" in combination with ""-desired variable"" such as:

`log_mod &lt;- glm(Survived ~ . -Name -Ticket -Cabin, data = train, family = ""binomial"")`

Fitting the model works fine and when I use summary(log\_mod) I can also see that Name, Ticket &amp; Cabin are not included in the model. The problem arises when using the model to predict new data (which also includes Name, Ticket &amp; Cabin):

`predict(log_mod, test, type = ""response"")`

`""Error in model.frame.default(Terms, newdata, na.action = na.action, xlev = object$xlevels) :` 

  `factor Name has new levels Abelson,...""`

I do understand that there absolutely should be an error when new factor levels occur in the new data. The thing is that the model should not even use these variables. Is there an elegant way of using ""\~. -Var1 -Var2 .."" without running into this problem? I could of course just drop them from the training set before (e.g. train$Name &lt;- NULL), but this does not seem very efficient.

All the residuals and normality etc are looking good, so I go to my boss with the great news, and they ask me ""So then **how much** should we invest in R&amp;D?"".

There might be a nice correlation, but it won't hold forever, and eventually a 1 dollar increase in R&amp;D will lead to a **reduction** in profit.

How would you go about determining how much to invest in R&amp;D? Using calculus to find a maximum springs to mind, but what formula am I working with? The equation for a straight line? In which case after taking the first derivative I'd be left with just the coefficient, which is next to nothing, and the second derivative would be 0 so it's a saddle point, so quite sure that's not the way to go.

I was briefly a data scientist at a startup, which was fun but was high pressure and long hours. Now I'm a data analyst on contract with great flexibility, regular hours, normal pressure. It's easier in the sense that I'm doing what I'm good at. I can do projects on the side for fun because I have the time. For me, that usually involves ML and I spend a lot of time learning about/playing with neural networks. I'm taking the Udacity Deep Learning ND to get me going on some interesting projects in my free time now that I'm at this new job. It has model deployment in SageMaker, which is great and I worked with briefly at my last job.

For real life, my weakness is my attachment to certain Python packages and only a year of programming experience. To be a ML engineer, I need to work on that, just thinking more like a SE at times. It's much more work and stress to go down this path and improve but is conceptually interesting to me.

Here's the kicker: SO and I are starting a family soon. By the time I finish Udacity and other needs, then apply to MLE jobs, we will be right in the thick of it. Is the stress of the change to MLE too high to do at this time or does it make more sense to find a permanent DA job and do these things for fun as I have time (which is what my SO does in a similar role)?

I feel overqualified for a lot of DA positions but don't have the confidence to do more at this time because of changing life events. As a DA, I'm leaving behind Python and other technologies right as I was getting quite good at them. That's why I signed up for the DL ND, to keep things fresh and challenging. Not sure what to do after that however- what path provides the most balance? I feel like I'm missing out on potential income but also interesting opportunities if I take it slow but I don't want to become overwhelmed and bad at everything I'm doing.

TLDR: Career change from comfortable to new-ish/more challenging position while or shortly after starting a family? Too much to take on?

In every position over the last 10 years Ive made significant contributions by creating spreadsheets/writing macros that saved my employers a ton of time/money by automating report assembly and document completion, finding inconsistencies in data, validating data, getting stock information, getting information from Amazon, getting census information, schedule optimization, data visualization, building models, applications using user forms, etc... in short Ive solved a wide variety of problems that should have been solved using specialized software by simply using Excel. I enjoy this and think that it may be best for me to pursue a position where I do this for a living (rather than being the overpaid Administrative Assistant with 100 different responsibilities that includes troubleshooting VBA code).  Which leads me to ask... Are the projects I have completed enough to get a foot in the door as a Data Analyst? What kind of projects should I work on? What additional skills do I need to obtain? What kind of positions should I try applying for? What kind of salary can I reasonably expect?

I have an almost finished math/stats/Econ degree (half of which Ive forgotten because I rarely use it) and no way of finishing (my school does not offer upper level math courses in the evening or online). I can not finish it elsewhere because I have been unable to find an online Math/Stats program so am considering finishing the Econ degree which if done online will take me a few years. I have experience with Matlab and stata but do not work with either on a regular basis (but would love to). I have some familiarity with python but use VBA for everything because most of my projects are designed for the less sophisticated user. Most of my computer science knowledge comes from MIT courses on YouTube and tinkering with all kinds of code since I was 14 (Im 33). 

I have considered the idea of doing a Data Science coding boot camp at Rutgers but am totally turned off by all the web development material that does not interest me. Are there any online courses that I should look into (Ive seen quite a few but not sure if they would add anything to resume)

Any advice is appreciated. 

Also, have very little interest in becoming an actuary (for some reason this is always suggested)

Soo Heres the example: You have been asked to prepare a report for an important meeting. You had to prepare it very quickly, gathering data from a number of different departments. One hour before this meeting you notice a mistake in some of the data you have been given by one of the departments. The person who gave you this data is one of your peers. He is in another meeting. You have some time available before your meeting.

1. Postpone your meeting so you can get the department to check there are no further errors in the report.
2. Check through the data yourself quickly, make amendments and then go ahead with your meeting.
3. Politely interrupt the person's meeting. Ask him to check the data before your important meeting.
4. Go ahead with your meeting, but mention that some of the data needs to be checked.
