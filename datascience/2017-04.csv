I would like to get a deeper knowledge about the common architecture which is used to store and analyze big data (incl. structured data). Currently I've just some basic knowledge about frameworks like hadoop &amp; spark and as far as I know hadoop in combination with map reduce isn't efficient for e.g. modifying lot of datasets so you would probably go for spark &amp; cassandra but perhaps this is already an outdated information? Instead of reading tons of books I prefer to apply a course on edx for example but I actually didn't find a course where you learn both: the architecture and the analysis of structured big data. Perhaps some one of you can recommend a good starting point whether it is a book or online-course.

I have a dataset of used car lots.  From 2015-October 2016, the used cars were resold immediately without any car detailing or thorough washing.

From November to Present,  Cars received a thorough interior or exterior detailing. and then resold.

**results**
the average sales price went up after the car washes were instituted. This is holding make/model of the car constant.

**My Question**
Showing a table of car make/models and the before and after prices isnt really much of an analysis.  I want to take this as an opportunity to do more.

I need to have a value statement that shows the value the car washes added.

Could this be used here or is my thinking wrong?  The one issue is that if the car mix changed slightly, then an overall forecast like that would be inaccurate and im not sure how to account for that.

Only 8 students get in and I have never wanted anything more in my life. I've been studying data science fundamentals through bigdatauniversity and dataquest. 

The VP of Technology at my university is generously offering to be a reference and now I have two other references but I can only use one:
1. My CS Java professor for the past year
2. My past manager for 4 years

My CS professor has known me for a year and have built rapport with each other. He hosts meetups and I have been able to bring people to his events and he has also helped my college club with our events. He has seen me code from zero to now so he understands my work as a student. I haven't gotten less than an A in any of his assignments or classes.

My manager has known me for 4 years and knows my work ethic. The reason I am considering him is because he also knows my ambitions and that I want to be a data scientist. He has supported me through my crazy school schedules and when I quit his company, he did not want me to go. In fact, I am now in conversations to go back to my old position under his management as a part-timer. He let me know he will give me any schedule I need, even if I need to leave for an internship.

I am not sure who I should include as a reference or if I should sneak all three of them into my resume even though in the form I am only asked for two.

What do you all think?

I've also heard you're not on call unless something breaks, and I don't see how building a model or doing an analysis would result in a middle-of-the-night emergency call. Does the same level of insane work/life balance that applies to AWS engineers and other software developers apply to analysis-focused data scientists? So far I have a good vibe from my interviewers.

Background:  

I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and have 2 yrs professional experience as a Software Developer. Have been taking MOOCs in Python, data analytics, and some machine learning with some small projects to show off on github. Have been mostly looking at and interviewing for Data Analyst positions in NYC (startups and some bigger industry names) but found that I am getting beat out by candidates with graduate degrees or bootcamp experience. 

Options:

I was recently accepted to NYC Data Science Academy and am in the final interview stage with Metis. I also have another interview with a Data Analyst role in Ad Tech coming up. I don't know if I'll even get accepted to all three options, but in the situation that I do, I'm not sure which is the best move.

Thoughts:

General consensus through google search/reddit seems to be that if you're going to pick a bootcamp, pick Metis. 
The obvious drawback is that it's expensive, and I could theoretically learn the stuff on my own (if I wasn't working full time and could get super motivated).

The great part of a bootcamp is being able to learn a whole lot in 3 months and get a huge amount of help in finding a job (alumni connections, etc.). I'd also hope to make a decent amount more money so I could pay off the tuition pretty quickly.

Getting a job as a Data Analyst would obviously be great as I would get paid while gaining experience in data science. A drawback is that I might not get as much exposure to working in machine learning and advanced data science topics as I would through a bootcamp. Also I don't know if I'd get a much better job after completing the bootcamp than just taking the data analyst position now.


I know most reddit people  think learning on your own and not paying that much money is the best move, but I can't help but think the bootcamps offer a lot more than what I could learn on my own. ",5,1

Does anyone have a recommendation of a good Statistics / Statistical Modeling book? Exploring data, looking for correlations, determining the legitimacy of a hypothesis or a discovered pattern... Stuff like that.

I'm currently reading and enjoying ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"" by Kruschke, to give an example of the kind of book I like. Though I probably want a more traditional Frequentist perspective this time -- I don't think my new workplace is interested in moving away from the sacred p-value.

* How to test code

Implementing these will force some people to change certain habits, I'm posting here to get feedback on the choices we've made:  

* We chose Scala for data processing and pipelines
* Data Processing is are developed and deployed inside the databricks(Spark) platform
* We've chosen R over Python for analytical code
* R code uses the sparklyr library for connecting to Spark
* R code is done in the ""Tidyverse"" way using R for Data Science, as a bible
* Analysis must be produced using rMarkdown and saved as HTML
* ML code tries to use Spark's MLLib when possible
* All code must be in Git version control
* A new git repo is created for every analysis
* Common reusable code is regrouped in a common git repo
* Common reusable code must be unit tested using testthat

I'm interested in knowing if you guys see any major pitfalls or wholes in our plan!",2,8

So I've scraped a CL section, cleaned out most of the HTML Mark up, and am using Sci-kit learn's tf-idf vectorizer and the DBSCAN cluster function to measure the ads. 

The problem I'm having is: the only clusters that are showing up are ads that are exactly the same. Ads that are literally 1 character different(62 inch vs 64 inch) are showing up in different clusters.

- Do I need any formal education to become a data scientist?

- What languages should I learn? Python? R? SQL? Else? Why?

- What are the typical Data Science Job Interview questions?

- What's the difference between a Data Scientist, a Data Analyst and a Business Analyst?

- What's the salary and the work-life balance of a Data Scientist?

- Where to start?

- What are the best books and online courses?

The problem is, I don't know what I'm worth. I have no metrics to compare against, and I'm the only person in my company in this country (United States) with this title / responsibility.

I've been looking at other companies (they universally pay more) and average wages (in paid less than the low end according to glass door). 

I want to know what I'm worth for a couple reasons: 1) general curiosity; 2) the ability to make a well-reasoned argument for a raise; and 3) so I can accurately represent myself to potential employers. 

So how can I figure out what I'm worth? How do you do it?

Anyway, I am currently an analyst in the risk management department of a major utility company. I was originally planning to go the actuarial route (even having 3 exams passed as of now AND having majored in Actuarial Science). Recently though, I have been doing some soul-searching and am realizing more each day that the data science field is a better fit for me. I won't list why for the sake of this post, but it goes beyond the just $ of course.

At my current job, I got R and SAS on my computer (the former I have used in a project before in my last year of college). One of my performance goals this year is to at least show something basic that I believe the manager would like to see with one or more programs (especially if I discover more useful tools down the road) of this caliber, and then get more complex with it as time goes by. It's also worth mentioning that this manager *wanted* someone who can learn this stuff, so me learning whatever program I can get my hands on will benefit both of us. On top of this of course, my job (as well as my college major, as the AS program did at least involve some programming projects) consists a lot of organizing and communicating the data. I also downloaded Python on my home computer a day ago and am planning to play around with it (and possibly get a textbook of sorts on it). 

While I'm ready and willing to work hard, there is one possible caveat, I don't have a Masters/PhD, is this necessary to have? I'm primarily worried about having to go into some pricey loan if I were to do this (i.e. extra financial planning I suppose). Regardless of whether I need more schooling or not, I guess all my post boils down to is: what else should this aspiring data scientist be doing now from here?

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: I also was introduced to SQL before my current job, perhaps that is something to learn more of as well?

I'm using the original images (Format 1), and all the train, test, and extra directories come with bounding box information in digitStruct.mat.  So far my plan is to crop the images using the bounding box information, normalize the image, and then reshape the images into a 64x64 squares.  These will be my inputs.

Would it be okay for me to then use the given bounding box information to crop out the individual digits in the image, then feed them into separate classifiers?  Or am I supposed to somehow be able to predict the bounding box coordinates for the digits in the image?

I'm a soon-to-be Chemistry graduate from the University of East Anglia in the UK, and I can confidently say that I don't want to pursue a career in Chemistry. During my course, I've done modules in Analytical and Forensic Chemistry, and I really enjoyed the analysis of data given to me, and communicating my findings through technical reports and presentations. I started applying for graduate schemes as an Analyst this year, and although I wasn't successful, I was getting feedback that my CV and applications were good. I started applying for job ads as an analyst in various different sectors, and I'm getting rejected straight away. I think it's because I'm not trained in Data Science skills, things like R, Python, SQL...

So I've applied to do a Masters conversion course in Computing Science at UEA (link below) and I've been offered a place. It looks to me like a good course for me to get a grounding in those skills. The department also sounds as if it has a very good research group involved in Data Science and Machine Learning, so my dissertation could be quite interesting. I could also do my research project in collaboration with a company, as a paid placement.

My question is how valuable is a Masters degree in Computing Science for Data Science providers in the UK. It's a career path I definitely want, but I want to be sure that I'm going to stand a good chance of getting a good job at the end of it.

I'm doing OK with my job (good performance reviews etc) and feel like I could likely have my pick of sideways-career moves, but I really struggle  staying focussed on my work in the office for 8+ hours a day, I find I get bored after 2 or 3 hours each day. And I find it hard to care about what I'm doing. I look around me and see people happily plodding along doing whatever the Product Managers tell them but I get so restless and bored. And my work has a very ""flat"" management structure, so there's almost no opportunities for advancement which I feel might motivate me in the short term at least.

I never thought I would work in a corporate office, I kind of fell into the job since I decided that I couldn't face the stress of postdoc life but i'm wondering if it's not suited to my strengths.

My favourite things about my job are 

 * answering questions on stackoverflow
 * fixing bugs in jupyter/pandas/scikit-learn
 * helping people at work with questions
 * pair programming where i can teach or learn something
 * becoming a course mentor for AI/ML on Udacity (I didn't do the course but qualified due to my work experience)


My favourite things about my PhD were:

 * Mastering difficult proofs
 * TA'ing
 * Talking with other researchers about research problems and working things out together

I'm trying to decide whether I should change careers and become a high-school teacher. Or maybe go into management where at least I would have some bigger-picture responsibilities and mentoring (or would I?). I feel like I'm not suited for the hacking away at nitty-gritty details, I don't have the patience for it and I don't think it's good for my mental health trying to fit int this. I really think I want something more conceptual/bigger-picture.

Does this ring any bells for people here? Am I deluding myself that there's a better fitting job for me? Should I just devote all my energy to get better at focussing on boring tasks?

Im sorry for making another one of these types of posts, but I dont really have anybody to ask for career advice. I am currently a Senior in college (with one more year to go), majoring in International Relations and Minoring in Data Science. Ive been sorta going through some soul searching during this last semester and I feel completely lost when it comes to my future. 

Years ago I selected the International Relations due to my interest in foreign affairs, my experiences in Afghanistan, and a (far) wish to possibly work for the government as an analyst of some kind. I took two years of Chinese, and a bunch of economic/ analytical focused type classes. It wasn't until last year that I discovered that I kind of like statistics and ""data"", and with the help of my department I was able to enroll in my universities brand new data science minor. Ive only had three classes within the minor itself (stats,  intro to programming, and intro to data mining. All three being areas I have zero experience in), and Ive discovered that I find it all extremely fascinating and fun, but I have the problem of completely sucking at all of them. 

I enjoy learning about data science techniques and have been slowly teaching my self R Studio, Python, SAS, and SPSS. I never really cared about grades (even though I have a pretty good GPA), ive always cared more about learning skills and becoming good at them. Im sorry for the long speil, but its to set up why im asking for advice. 

I want to become a Data scientist, but unfortunately its to late in my college career to change over to something like Statistics, and I am instead stuck with my IR major. I want to know what exactly I should even do to become competitive in the job market, if there is even a point in my continuing the minor (as in I'll learn skills, but not enough to be hired), and if Data Science hiring managers would just take one good look at my education history and throw my resume away. I see so many different stories on this sub about what people did to become one, and none of them apply to my (unique/stupid) predicament.

***Is this experience common to others in industry?***

Unfortunately, I feel like I don't have enough perspective to know if this is because we are lacking technical experience (i.e., we are doing it wrong) or Deep Learning isn't actually that useful for normal/smaller industry problems.  ",6,4

When I first joined my current company, data was mostly obtained by passing around and modifying huge SQL queries to various databases, making large data dumps, and then using Python/R/Pig/Spark to clean and transform the data into something smaller and more usable.  We have now transitioned much of that to REST APIs.

*** 
**The Good**

REST APIs make for much more simple, human-understandable requests than the SQL queries, require no knowledge of the underlying database (in theory) and return data in a structured form that better handles complexity.  Responses can often be much quicker, depending on the size of the request and proper use of concurrency.

***
**The Bad**

It *seems* to make large data dumps (i.e., like with SQL) much more difficult.  Often, I have daisy chain requests, so that I hit one API, then use that response to hit another endpoint, and then use that response to hit another endpoint.  

I also find that most of the analytics tools I use (and perhaps my mindset) are built for tabular data (i.e., Data Frames).  I usually end up doing all a ton of work to pull down a large amount of complex, structured data from various endpoints, just to flatten and aggregate them all into what a SQL data dump would look like.

The firm is young and while we have utilized data in the past, we are aiming to become even more data driven. We have a number of marketing clients (mostly music industry and health care), but also have special projects running ecommerce for larger clients, as well as in-house application(s). 

Currently I am hand-coding a great deal of the data for historical tracking (some basic Google Analytics data, Ecom data from Shopify, Facebook ad performance data, Artist(s) Spotify monthly listener data, etc.) into my advanced data warehouse known as Google Drive/Sheets, cleaning it and connecting it to Tableau to generate basic visualizations that I am copy and pasting into reports. Its a bit of a clumsy way to do it but has worked for our current scale. However, as projects get larger and more intricate, I will need to spend more of my time analyzing and improving/adapting procedures (as well as other research based task-functions that are a part of my job) rather than time spent on manual data entry, cleaning, organization and clumsy report compiling. (In no way am I discounting Tableau, but I havent gotten over the learning curve just yet so Im not really attuned to its full capabilities)

With goals decided, I am currently in the process of deciding which ETL I would like to marry us to (open-source? or perhaps commercial, i.e, Fivetran), as well as the best commercial data visualization/dashboard/access platforms (i.e., Looker, Periscope, Chariot, Consinus)

Listed below are some of the platforms essential for us to pull performance data from:

Web property analytics

- Google Analytics
- Hubspot

Ad based 

- Facebook Ads Manager
- Google Adwords

Ecommerce

- Shopify

Payment processing

- Stripe
- Payscape
- Quickbooks

App Performance

* Mixpanel

Public data

* Spotify (and other streaming services)
- Touring information
- Census
- Economic
- (collect public data from consumer reports, etc., to contextualize performance)

Internal data

- Google Sheets - some operational data (i.e., client outreach performance, hours, travel expenses, other HR data, etc.) will still be manually input

Im also exploring ways Airtable and Zapier can help with these goals. 

Now Periscope was the company that started this search, and my only fear with them is how SQL reliant their platform is. While I dont have any hands on experience with SQL, Ive learned the basics of SQL through an online course and I am more than willing to learn more (and in fact having some easy/basic experience would be fun/valuable) for what this department requires, I have read one independent person on a forum write that platforms like Periscope are designed to be used by technical developers who are experts in writing SQL queries. It is a great tool if you are looking to turn complicated queries into charts, and if Im not mistaken, that does not sound like us. However, the ETL we choose may change that.

Here are some of the other products I am currently researching:


ETL

* Fivetran
* Datavirtuality
* Xplenty
* Alooma
* Tungsten Replicator (open source)

Analysis/Visualization

* Periscope
* Looker
* Charito
* Consinus

We are looking for something affordable (example, periscope's $1k/mo is far too much), and ease of sharing dashboards (it would be a dream to have the ability for clients to have a dashboard they could log in to and drill down into their data if they wanted). 

Marrying yourself to an ETL is a big deal, and choosing a visualization/access platform is a hefty investment, so I wanted to come to an experienced, unbiased community to help assess our situation and what commercial or open source products may be best for us. Any insights from experience or knowledge is greatly appreciated. 

Im just psyched to build all this out and want to make sure I choose the right tools to build it with. Thanks!",10,10

I have accepted a PhD position in epidemiology and will begin my studies in the fall. However, I am interested in the biostatistics side of Epidemiology and would like to eventually pursue a career in data science. Unfortunately, I have no programming experience other than playing around with HTML back in the day for MySpace layouts. Moreover, I have only recently become more fully aware of the wonderful world of statistics and the careers available within this field. I always knew statistics were used by scientists, but did not really comprehend that the scientists doing the research were not necessarily the ones performing the statistical analyses. My PhD program does require students to take 6 credits of SAS, but I would like to set aside some time to learn more about programming and about data science in general. Assuming my degree takes the traditional four years, would this give me sufficient time to develop skills in Python and R if I set aside five to six hours a week? What can I do besides self-teach programming to develop myself into a competent, career-worthy individual. ",5,1

I am a graduate student working towards my PhD in biophysics. I work in a very experimental lab, and I have built and maintained our laser systems the past several years. I have always been interested in manipulating data, and I have discovered that my future lies far outside of the academy. I do not have too much longer (started my thesis last month) and I don't really think I have built up quite enough skills to make myself attractive in the job market. As I mentioned before, my lab is quite experimental and there was a certain way to analyze data and produce publication quality graphs that didn't allow me much leeway or time to learn a lot about data science tools. My data sets are also not that large. I know the basics of Python and R, and am quite proficient at Mathematica + MATLAB, but I really need to *show* I can manipulate data. In addition, I have strong interpersonal and communication skills, and my PhD was very diverse so I have been exposed to a very large number of fields. So I have two questions:

1. Does anyone have any tips on projects I can work on to build an online portfolio? 

2. How much do skills outside of coding matter in the data science job market? Skills like communication and critical thinking. 

I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Thank you all so much.",14,1

The headlines are parsed into a TD-IDF vectors. The three models I had in mind are Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forests.

My thought was to insert R as a pre-processing layer between the data storage and the dashboard. At the moment, data is ETL'd locally in power bi and the file size is huge and slow to process.

My thoughts would be that three dimensions need to be combined to get a good ""view"" measure:
* Immediate elevation change, the steeper/taller the better the view
* Distant elevation change, what elevation does the distant landscape change to
* Angle of vision, e.g. how broad can you sweep and still see a ""view""

So, combining all of this with the fact that human vision on earth is limited to ~5km due to curvature I can try to do something like this:

* Draw lines from the point of interest to all of the ""horizon"" points at 5km
* Integrate the difference in elevation along each line, include a scaling factor that is 1 at the point of interest and 0 at the horizon point, this result is the view factor for that line
* Integrate all of the view factors to see how broad of a sweep the view is

It wasn't until the past year I ""discovered"" that I was interested in data science through a class I took, so I took any relevant classes I could at school while finishing my degree. Most of my degree consisted of theoretical classes (optimization, LP, stochastic processes, etc.) that I did not particularly enjoy. I much preferred the more practical/hands-on project-based courses of the couple of data science courses I took.

Well now I'm graduated, and looking for a job like many people are. I look at the requirements for data science jobs and just feel woefully inadequate. If I'm lucky they're asking for only 1-2 years experience, but I look at my data science experience: I took 2 courses focused on data science, and in those courses I completed 4-5 assignments/projects. And that's pretty much it. I feel I'm familiar with many aspects of the field, but no expert in anything. I've looked at data science interview sample questions, and I feel after some studying/review I can at least give some sort of reasonable response for a good number of them. I've taken classes on statistics and probability and dabbled with machine learning algorithms. I have used Python/R but have never used SQL, so I've been spending time trying to sharpen my coding. I read all sorts of blogs and stuff saying you have to know/use github, Hadoop, jupyter, etc. which I have also never used (I did my school projects just using spyder and Rstudio).

I've looked into data science workshops/bootcamps, but I've also heard that programs like Springboard merely compile information/resources you can access online. I've looked into Kaggle competitions and feel overwhelmed. I know I need more experience, so I guess my question is, how much experience are we expected to even have to actually get an interview/job? Should I just go for something like a data analyst just to get some experience before going for a data scientist position further down the line?

I was wondering if someone could give me advice on what I should do to build a strong resume for a data science position.

Currently, i am finishing my junior year studying Engineering Physics at a the University of Illinois. I always had a knack for numbers, and have thoroughly enjoyed probability and statistics my whole life. Because of this, I decided i want to pursue a data science career. 

Ideally i would have planned on doing this when i first started college, but i didn't realize what i wanted to do until this past winter. This makes me feel a little behind the ball in terms of building a resume. 

I am taking some 400 level statistics courses, along with an intro cs course on java (intended for cs majors so it is relatively in depth and goes over major concepts). 

As of right now I can say i have basic knowledge of java and python along with advanced knowledge in mathematics, physics and statistics. I realize my weak suit is cs skills, and it is something i am working to improve. 

I applied for some internships over this summer, and i heard back from IBM however for various reasons i wasnt able to follow up with the next steps in the process. I also feel that I might be in over my head if i jumped in right now because my cs skills arent as great as they could be ( I can write basic programs and understand the topics i have been taught, i just need more practice to hone my sills).

This summer my plan was to take a course or two at university, while doing a cs project that I can put on my resume and gain further experience. 

Here lies my question. what languages are most valuable that i should make a project in? I can do it in python or java and develop those skills more, or I was thinking I could try and do something in R and get some exposure to that. I basically want to do whatever looks best to put on my resume. 

furthermore, I have some basic ideas of what kind of program i would want to write, but i am not sure if they would be too complex for me at this stage. Could you point me in a direction as to what i should write ( or does it even matter that much to employers?) and what language would be best to practice over this summer so i can try to enter the field next may after i graduate?

If my plan doesnt seem solid and you think there is a better way i could spend my time, i would love to hear it. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and i would really appreciate any advice or guidance to get me closer to my goal and entering the real world.

I started to learn Python some time ago and I wonder if I couldn't somehow could do the  analysis automated. Maybe a method that can spot patterns that lead to a high market share if a certain condition (that discount is grants) is met ?

I was hoping to finish my PhD studies by my 6th year but my advisor and committee told me I needed more results which would take me probably another 2 years. Also, my funding is running out next year which is a big a concern because I'll have to TA which may further slow down my research.

I started interviewing for full-time out of frustration and was surprised when I received two full-time data scientist offers, one of which is at a tech company which I would love to work for. Both places know that I'd intended to withdraw from my PhD. However, I have yet to submit the paperwork to withdraw nor have I informed my advisor because I fear that I am making a long-term mistake.

Will having a PhD benefit me any way in terms of career progression or future opportunities? Most data science managers I've seen have a PhD but I'm not sure this is standard across the industry. Given that I can already obtain a job in data science without a PhD, I'm not sure if the slight bump in compensation is worth another two years of research.

I'd appreciate some guidance/ advise as to what would make the most sense if I wanted to transition into a career in data science.
Some background:

* I graduated an economics major with some math classes under my belt(did fairly well in linear, multivar calc, intro stats and econometrics, intro to real analysis, though most of it went over my head)
* Not sure what I wanted to do after school, so I landed a job as an analyst at an economics consulting firm because it seemed like a good progression from what I did at school
* I've done a variety of research assistant type things at my job and on the technical side my firm doesn't do a lot of high level technical analyses, but I've gotten a chance to do some basic data cleaning and programming. It's all pretty basic stuff especially as an analyst taking instructions, but I like interacting with data and coding things up.
* Fast forward 2 years at this job, there's not much more to learn at my position and I've been thinking more and more about my future career. The most common path is for analysts to get an MBA, but as much as the earning potential after an MBA is tempting, I think I would like being involved in the more technical aspects of analysis. This is when I started looking into data science as a potential career.
* I could possibly aim to get a more quantitative data analyst job with some self study of online courses to increase my programming and technical skills, but as I look through job postings, it seems like most firms want masters or phd graduates for the more interesting data science jobs anyway. I also learn better in a more structured environment.
* So I'm at a dilemma now. I've been toying with the idea of going back to school to get a masters as I'm thinking that grad school would make the most sense now that I'm still relatively fresh out of school. There are all these new data science masters popping up that seem really interesting but at the same time, people seem to be skeptical about their rigor and I would hate to waste a ton of money on an expensive program without much return. On the other hand, I feel like my math/stats background is too weak for a good program in stats (only intro classes). Furthermore, I'm not that interested in the theory aspect of stats, but more the applied part. Is there a grad program out there that is a medium between the two? And will that help me get a job eventually as a data scientist? Or should I just focus on getting my foot into the field as a data analyst and take it from there?",19,7

# Personal background
31yrs old with a BS in Mechanical Engineering but I have always worked in the web development and web marketing industry. I don't have a math/stats background apart from the exams I took at university back then.

# Study plan and time schedule
In general I would prefer the Python path over R, simply because of its flexibility and multipurpose use.

These are roughly the learning blocks I will go through

1. Math &amp; Statistics
2. Python in Data Science
3. Machine learning
4. Distributed computation frameworks
5. Practical experience

Here is a table outlining the _initial_ learning path

##### Legend
* the _Length_ is either in _nr of pages_ (if media is book) or _hours_ (if media is video)
* to calculate the _Eta (hrs)_ for the books I have used [this website](http://www.readinglength.com/book/isbn-1491912766/), set reading speed at 200wpm (I am not native english speaker) and multiplied by 2.5; for the videos I have multiplied the duration by 1.5
* to calculate the _Eta (days)_ I have considered to study ~4 hrs a day (I could dedicate more time, but I would prefer not to leave the job for now), so it's _Eta(hrs)/4_ rounded up

The total amount of time it would take to complete this curriculum is 146 days, considering I would probably take one day off every week, the total would be ~167 days. [Here is a gantt chart I did to estimate it](http://imgur.com/gBcoxGm). _If someone is interested in the spreadsheet with the various entries to adapt the chart to its schedule let me know_.

After the above schedule has been completed I would:

* [Start](https://techbeacon.com/10-influential-data-scientists-why-you-should-follow-them-twitter) [following](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2012/12/most-influential-data-scientists-on-twitter.html) [relevant](https://www.springboard.com/blog/top-data-scientists-on-twitter/) [people](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/top-data-scientists-on-twitter) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/clarecorthell)
* Join Kaggle competitions on my own or [team up with other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/62mfaa/teamup_for_kaggle_competitions/)
* Follow local meetups
* Start listening to DS podcasts (Linear Digressions, Data Skeptic, Talking Machines...)
* Eventually join a datakind.org project
* Eventually follow some more specific course on [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com)

_For each of the above learning blocks I have found other useful resources too that I would consider studying after completing the above schedule. To keep the post short I will not write them here. If someone is interested please let me know and I will share them._

# Questions
1. Is the curriculum well enough structured to give me a solid foundation to start working on some personal/open source projects and start building a portfolio?
2. Did I underestimate the time it would take to complete each book/course (or the total amount of time to complete the #1-19 table)?
3. Would you replace or add any book/course in the above schedule?
4. I would choose Python over R mostly because it can be useful for many other things other than Data Science. Do you think I should start with R or study both from the beginning?
5. If you have **any suggestion** to share I would love to hear them

I'm currently an undergraduate with a computer science major and a statistics minor. My end goal is being a data scientist for a tech company. I've started looking at grad schools and I saw something I hadn't seen before. Purdue has a [joint stats/cs masters program](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/curriculum/statistics_cs.html)

I know a little bit about Purdue CS and that it is very systems heavy (normal requirements are compilers, os, networks), but this program has more of an emphasis on theory and ML classes as well as the opportunity to take databases. 

At the end of my undergraduate I'll have completed coursework in data structures/algorithms, cs theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining(in both stats and eecs department), information retrieval, databases, web databases, probability, regression analysis, and theoretical statistics. 

Most of the courses in this program are graduate versions of undergraduates courses I have taken or will take next year. On one hand it kinds of feels redundant but it seems like a huge amount of the data science positions I see are geared towards someone with an advanced degree. 

Does this program look like something that would be a good preparation to being a data scientist in industry?

Thanks all.

1. do PCA and reduce the features.

I've tried several classification algorithms, without too much fine tuning, just to get a feeling of how the baseline performance was. They all got an accuracy score of around 99%, that is exactly the ratio between class 0 samples and total samples. Artificially under-sampling just got the accuracy score down to the very same ratio of the new dataset, so no improvement on that side.
The F1 score is really bad because I'm experiencing awful Type II errors: basically, the algorithm is just guessing that everything is belonging to class 0. With some models that I tried, it literally predicts everything to be class 0: false positives are 0 (because no positive samples get predicted) and false negatives are really a lot (because actual positives are predicted to be negative). The AUC-ROC curve is around 50% (awful), and weighting the models to take into account the skewness of the classes brought no improvement.
I tried to do some feature engineering (ensembling the supervised classification on top of some unsupervised clustering), with almost no luck.
Do you have any suggestions regarding how to tackle such problems / how to diagnose the underlying issue(s) that prevent(s) the predictor from being accurate? Or I should take this as a proof that, given my dataset, belonging to class 1 is just random (so I should collect more features)?

I feel extremely lost so I thought I would ask you all for help. I do use this platform a lot silently and it has helped me a lot, but I have never posted before. 

A bit about me, I am a 22 year old female, doing my Master's in Electrical Engineering from top University in USA. My original career plan was to follow Signal Processing.  But due to the freedom of choosing courses at my university I was lucky enough to get a Data Science and Signal Processing track and I absolutely fell in love with Data. 

So I ended up taking courses like Probability, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning etc. 

Now I am an international student here and ideally I should have a summer internship. I have applied wide and far, to more than 100+ internships. I am not even hearing back from them. I have lost hope for this summer because the deadline to submit my internship offer letter at my university is soon approaching (May 12th). 

I code in Python, and I will admit that I am not as fast as a traditional CS Student. However, I do write decent code, eventually. We never got enough exposure to programming in EE, during my bachelors back home in India. I have done a lot of projects (Kaggle, coursework etc) and have worked up on my Mathematics and Statistics. 

I know I am extremely hard-working and can adapt and learn really fast. I am just waiting for that one opportunity to click. I am scared too because I have already taken the leap of faith. I have spent $$$$ on this Master's and have abandoned my EE path. 

It seems almost impossible to crack Data Science without work experience, and I need some work experience to get started. How do I land an opportunity and prove my worth! 

Please any help, any advice, anything that steers my rocky boat in the right direction would greatly appreciate it. I want someone to believe in me and give me that chance :(

I hold a phd in civil engineering (properly: modeling of concrete structures, but somewhat close so https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mechanics ), but I do not see a good demand for my skills where I live (southern Italy, but Italy in general). 


At the moment I also should learn real structural design on the job, since my competences are mainly theoretical. Generally I search for a job in europe, but the only foreign language I know is English (and very little Spanish).


It appears 'data science' jobs are in great demand. Let's say I could be comfortable in modeling, processing of data and consultancy.
I started thinking about it 1 year ago when just out of curiosity I took a machine learning course on coursera. Found it pretty easy and enjoyable (still I know those are kind of watered-down versions). Now I am taking a statistics course.


Given all this do you think it may be possible to find a job in data-science? What kind of positions may I look for to grow professionally?

I know there would be A LOT to learn, but smalls steps are doable if the market really requests data scientist in the mid-term. Any advice is welcome.

Basically, what books van I read, what projects can I work on, what software or languages should I learn, so my supervisor can look at me and say ""hey this kid's done his homework."" 

I'd contact my supervisor directly to ask him ahead of starting this internship but the recruiter told me they'd give me that info a few weeks before the job starts in early June. So in the meantime I'd like to get a leg up,if possible, and I was hoping maybe sone fellow data scientists/supervisors could tell me what they'd recommend a new recruit to do/learn.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you.

Tldr: starting data science internship, what can I learn to ""be ahead"" of expectations?",8,3

This is yet another ""advice"" thread, so please bear with me...

**Background**
BS in Molecular Biology with some academic research experience(2-3ish yrs) and now I'm racking up some industry experience (&lt;1yr). I mostly deal with wet lab and do some data management/analysis (in-house software). 

**Goal**
I would like to move towards a data analytics position and hopefully, later on, fall into a data science career. My relevant knowledge/skills comprise some statistics with R (statistical tests, visualization), python (scripting, data analysis, scraping) and some machine learning knowledge (basic use of sklearn to train models).

**Advice**
I'd like to know what you guys think about the nanodegree programs at Udacity, particularly the Data Analytics program. Obviously, an advanced degree (MS/PhD; thinking about statistics/biostats) would be preferred, but it seems more profitable, thinking in terms of financial and time investment aiming for an entry level position as a data analyst (of course, this is IF and only IF I can jump onto a data analyst path afterwards).

I work as a Data Architect currently and have my masters in Information Systems with a concentration on Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence. I know how to do basic analytics and data visualization but have been playing a lot more with predictive analytics and machine learning and I fall short a lot on the statistics.

I have been looking into going back to graduate school and have narrowed it down to two programs:
Applied Economics - http://business.und.edu/academics/msae/

and

Data Analytics - http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/graduate/data-analytics/curriculum.htm

I am leaning towards the Applied Economics as its an actual research degree (Thesis based) since my first my current Master's degree is a terminal degree (Course work). 

The Data Analytics degree has a lot of the Math that I need, but the Applied Economics program will also go over a lot of the same Math that I need but in a more applied manner.",8,7

This is mostly out of curiosity for why people choose one over the other. I believe in the past I have heard that each have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to data science. Being only 1 year out of undergrad I am curious what others think between the 2 avenues for analysis. 

What I have found so far:

1. Python is much more explicit when it come to basic graph parameters(which is more tedious, but makes it more malleable). This being said, both Python and R can make gorgeous plots.

2. Python is simple when slicing and filter data-frames for analysis; and scaling, binning, transforming is quick and easy. (not to say R is much harder, but it seems pandas and sklearn.preprocessing have some stronger muscles to flex)

3. R is quick and easy to create regression models, but becomes a bit maddening when it comes to machine learning packages (Neural Network in particular seems more complicated than it's worth.)


Do you think this is correct?


Side question: This may be a small syntax annoyance, but for a new data dude it made a difference: importing packages from R is so simple ""library(x)"" &amp; python importing can be layers of imports. Do people just memorize these???",90,25
434,2017-4-27,2017,4,27,2,67puee,MS in Data Science/Analytics should be treated like MBAs (by applicants),https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/67puee/ms_in_data_scienceanalytics_should_be_treated/,drhorn,1493229338,"We see a lot of posts on this subreddit about which masters in data science/analytics they should apply to, and how to choose between them and a traditional masters degree in economics/computer science/statistics/OR/applied math. 

First things first: at every masters program in this world, what you learn and how well you learn it is not nearly as important for your job prospects as the quality of the ""stamp of approval"" that you are receiving, i.e., the perceived value of the degree itself.

The more traditional the field, the more programs there are out there with legitimate street cred.

For math, statistics, physics, there are going to be a LOT of programs that carry weight. That is in part because these programs tend to be very demanding, but also because they have had a long time to get established. When looking at resumes, if I see that someone has a masters in statistics, I am not super concerned about where they got it from. A bit, but not super concerned.

Engineering, computer science, OR, etc., are going to be a bit more reduced in the number of programs that are considered legit. The areas are a bit newer, there has traditionally been less interest for MS and PhD grads in these areas (though it's changing), so there is a smaller concentration of programs that are worth their salt. If I'm looking at someone with a MS in computer engineering, I'm looking for a top 25 program at least. 

Then you get into these new programs. Masters in advanced analytics. Masters in data science. Masters in analytics. Masters in data modeling. Whatever they may be, these are all normally programs that have been born in the last 10 years. They normally don't have the same level of academic rigor because they are being born out of demand in the field for people with this specific skillset, so it's actually more important to graduate people and get them out there than it is to arm them with legitimate knowledge of the underlying science part of data science.

That is not to say that these are bad programs, but a) they don't carry the same weight as their more traditional counterparts among hiring managers, and b) there is a much smaller set that are considered to be worthwhile.

Because of that, I think these newer types of MS degrees should be treated a lot like MBAs; That is, an MBA is only really worth getting if it's from a top, elite program. 

Getting an MBA from, I don't know, Kansas State is not likely to do a whole lot for your career. I would say that [top 25](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings) at most is worth the money, and I would argue that there are huge dropoffs after 7 (Berkeley), 12 (NYU,Duke), and 18 (UNC).

I feel the same way about Masters of Data Science/Analytics/etc programs. Using[ this ranking](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/schools/top-masters-in-analytics/) (don't really care which one you want to use), by the time you get to 15, you are really starting to lose steam. 

Just one man's opinion, but with how many questions there are about this, I think it was worth bringing up. What do you think?",17,3

I've found that doing data science on cloud machines often stresses me out, because I obsess over how long the machines are up, and the process of loading/unloading the data is more expensive. Getting a private server has definitely alleviated that pressure, since it's overall cheaper.

This particular server has 64GB DDR4 RAM, and the processor is ""Intel Core i7-6700

I went for this because the limitation on my laptop was often memory, so I thought, why not get a machine with a lot of RAM?

Here's a scenario:

I'm a successful youtuber who has a significant amount of subscribers and a few marketing partnerships.  There may even be products or services that I offer to able to support myself.

The problem is that I found that my subscription numbers have been growing increasingly slower, and with some analysis I find that I've saturated a high percentage of my market.  In order to continue my growth, I decide that I need to increase my visibility by appealing to a market where I would get the most new viewers, and that collaborating with another youtuber would be a great opportunity to do so.

My proposal: Hypothetically, let's say I have a dataset of all users' subscriptions and built a network of accounts that are connected by users that are subscribed to common channels.  I was thinking that with that, I can search for another account that has a high centrality with a weak tie, so that its users do not overlap with my saturated user base.

There are other elements that are a part of this model that make it less abstract, but is there something inherently incorrect about this?  Thanks

TLDR : I'm currently a Software Engineering BS at RIT minoring in Applied Statistics. I'm debating grabbing a MS in Applied Statistics and/or Computer Science after I graduate (probably also at RIT). To work as a Data Scientist, I assume it would be better to get the App Stats exposure? Would a PhD be mandatory, or would a MS suffice?

A couple of questions, if anyone is willing to answer them...

1. It seems like it's required to hold some sort of graduate degree to obtain a job as a 'data scientist'. What is the difference between a data scientist, an analyst, and an engineer? It seems as if the lines between those occupations are fuzzy, as the skills seem to consistently overlap.

2. I'll be taking some higher level Stats classes, namely [Design of Experiments](https://www.rit.edu/science/sites/rit.edu.science/files/COS-STAT-325-DesignOfExperiments-WI.pdf),[Mathematical Statistics I](http://ccrg.rit.edu/~whelan/courses/2015_3fa_STAT_405/), and [Non-Parametric Statistics](https://www.rit.edu/science/sites/rit.edu.science/files/COS-STAT-345-NonparametricStatistics.pdf). I'm hoping to also take Introduction to Intelligent Systems (a Computer Science class focusing on Machine Learning) and Introduction to Data Mining (also a CS class). Would these be worth taking? If not, are there any Stats/CS classes that you would recommend?

3. In regards to Math, I haven't yet taken DiffEq and MultiVar but I've been doing self learning (I don't know whether or not that will be sufficient). I've already taken Linear and Discrete. Should I take these formally? Also, are there any math topics (besides basic linear and calc) that those of you who are data scientists use on daily basis? I have a good idea from what I've seen here, on kaggle and related sites, and from doing my own research/reading, but I'd appreciate a recommendation from someone who actually works with data on a daily basis.

4. I'll also have this summer completely free. I'm planning on doing a lot of work with the kaggle datasets and doing independent learning in regards to math/stats concepts. Would you have any suggestions about resources, projects, or anything else that I could use / do / look at during that time?

Last note, as a Software Engineer, I am already intimately familiar with Python, C, and C++. I can always improve upon that, but I'm not very concerned about programming and/or technological proficiency right now.

I apologize for the (probably) inane questions, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of clear information in regards to a lot of these issues.

Thanks for reading!",2,0

However, every time I look at cost of living comparisons I feel like it's impossible to make the financial part of things work.

A little background, I am about to complete a BS of Psychology with a minor in philosophy and a minor in statistics.  I have done some work studies in which training programs were being analyzed and I truly enjoyed it.  Pretty much all statistical work I have done has been enjoyable.  I am a novice at R but have slowly been learning more. I really would love to work with data and possibly either be in a research setting or a training analysis setting.  It seems to me that going pure statistics is not the way since it would be less application type work.

My main questions are:
Am I confusing being a statistician with being a data scientist?
I know I will need to go to grad school, but what should I try to go for? It doesn't seem to me that I have enough computer science background to get into a data science program.  
What should I be doing right now, as an ungrad senior, to reach these goals?
Does it sound like my goals are actually what a data scientist does or have I misunderstood?

* Bachelor (small unknown private school) and Master (top 20 school) in biomedical subjects. 
* Currently finishing Master (decent EU university) in applied mathematics/computational engineering. 
* Two years biomedical research experience. 
* Two data science/machine learning internships at large companies (1 traditional tech, 1 pharma company).
* Finishing my thesis. 
* Need money (but I can hold out) and anxious to get some real full time experience in machine learning under my belt. 
* I do not have the DS &amp; A background that is required for most technical interviews so I would need to fix that in order to be successful for other interviews.



**The offer**: 

* Non-tech, scientific publishing company as an entry level software engineer, with this position being based in Philadelphia.
*  I'd be working on a ""hot"" machine learning team within the company that is apparently high visibility.
* Manager seems really great and the others I have talked to are really nice. 
* Salary offer is in mid 60K, which I think is quite low even for Philly.



**Pros**: 

* Work with cutting edge technology, with awesome datasets. 
* More importantly will need to develop scalable projects. 
* Good work-life balance. 
* High visibility. 
* Combines both of my backgrounds. 
* Stable company. 
* Company lets me finish my thesis while working.



**Cons**: 

* Low Pay (ok for now, but will this haunt me down the road?). 
* Located in a non-tech city (limits available career opportunities/need to start personal life over if/when I do move on). 
* Company is trying to transition from an old business model, so other parts of the company will be a bit archaic, not ""cutting edge""



**My questions**:

* Should I just go and grab quick experience doing meaningful and technically challenging work? 
* Would it be a better idea to hold out and gamble to see if something better comes along? 



**Additional Info**: 

* I live in a pretty cool city right now and wouldn't mind staying here for a few more months, but the financial situation is kind of tight and I would like to work in a ""real"" job. 
* Also the process seemed almost ""too easy"", am i just being paranoid about that?
