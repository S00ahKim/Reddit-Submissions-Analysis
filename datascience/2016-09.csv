I am looking at projects at Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
and also lots of sample data sets.

The problem with Kaggle is that the problems there are very hard. (at least as of now) and the problem with open datasets is that there is no problem statement (and nothing to compare my work against).

I wonder if there is an ""moderate"" problem statement and a dataset available somewhere. also after I have completed my project, I can come my work with the finished ""pro"" version and see how did I do.

I don't want a trivial project as well (like you find in many books). I want a sizable problem on which I can spend a few weeks .... but not impossibly hard (like do data science on higgs boson)",14,22

Disclaimer: I have spent many hours searching through the web (reddit + other resources) trying to find the ""best MOOC"" for data science.

**What I am looking for**: I want to get into Data Science and am more interested in learning Python than R (mostly my coworkers/colleagues have convinced me that Python is the better choice in terms of the versatility and future).

I want to build a solid foundation in using Python, as well as building a strong statistical foundation and intuition and am hoping to find a combination of MOOCs that will do just this.



**What I am not looking for**: It seems like a ton of people have posted these posts simply because they want to know ""Is _____ good enough to get me a job?"" I'm just not really interested in this.

I feel like people are hoping to find a magical MOOC or magical online certificate that will teach them everything they want to know in a month, and get them a $100k job.

Instead, I am hoping to come up with a list of a few different MOOCs that people found (from experience) to be very helpful that can give me a very strong foundation to DS/Python/Statistics. Qualities I am looking for are: 

- Courses that don't just teach you how to do something, but rather teach you the science/theory/reasoning behind it all. Like I said, I want to build a solid foundation in both Python/statistics, and not just ""here's how to do it""
- Courses that will cover the essential topics - whatever they may be


**Currently considering**:

1) MITx 6.00.1 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

2) MITx 6.00.2 - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

3) MITx 15.071 - The Analytics Edge (probably will try to do this in Python, instead of R)

Also looking at DataQuest - any experience with DataQuest? Curriculum looks really promising, don't know about the content.




I know this is a very common question, but like I said in my disclaimer, I've searched a ton of threads and just haven't found exactly what I am looking for. I understand there's no perfect MOOC, but am hoping that the smart people of redding can give good feedback from their personal experiences with MOOCs and **to come up with a list of MOOCs that would complement each other well to give a good overall foundation.**


**edit - my background**: Bachelors in Psychology although I did take 1.5 years of Math classes (was a math major for about a year and a half) so several calculus courses, linear algebra, differential equations, basic statistics, etc. Currently working as a business analyst and mostly do my work in MySQL. Job also gives opportunities to use Python/R, but have just been struggling to find time to study it, which is why I'm trying to pick out a couple courses and commit to it. ",4,3

Data Analysts are those who proficient in Excel, traditional Statistical packages &amp; testing but their skills in utilizing open source tools or ability to develop end-end solutions are quite lacking.

Data Scientists are those with exemplary Mathematical skills. Ex: They know Vector Calculus, Newton's method, and can devise entirely new ML to tailor their needs. They mostly spend their time researching but can code/scale/communicate their works if needed.

Citizen Data Scientists are those that bridge the gaps between the two. They have deeper knowledge than a typical Data Analyst. Familiarized with many tools that help them stay productive. They have practical knowledge of out-of-the-box ML algorithms but don't know the intricacy of underlying Mathematics behind them nor ability to devise a new ML model. They are generalist(i.e. functionable) in everything.

I have a feeling that many Data Scientist/Data Analyst positions posted in the job boards should be re-labelled as ""Citizen"" Data Scientist instead.",10,0

I'm building a spider for scraping job posting data because I've been jobless for three months and I'd like to reign in my search results. I want to fine-tune my program by integrating some detection prevention measures. From what I've read, it seems like crawling ethics are taken pretty seriously; I hope that I can mitigate any concerns by noting that this effort is purely personal and non-profit.

**Context:**

* I'm crawling through a list of specific companies, and I'm not crawling through job search engines.

* I will send requests once a day to retrieve new postings.

* My scraper can parse html, json, and xml.

* My crawling formula is company-specific, so it's approach is tailorable.

* I've built most of the spider framework already and don't want to do any major restructuring, so I'm reaching for the low-hanging fruit in terms of detection prevention.

* I have decent experience in Java for a non-CompSci major, but I'm no expert in programming, networking, etc. and will need your help with new ideas.

**Solution Ideas:**

I've found a couple interesting links, one of which I'll post [here](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/). Here are some of the ideas I'm thinking about:

* Pacing and distorting crawling - Lay out irregular time intervals between requests.

* Altering click path pattern - Do not follow a regular clickstream.

* Setting up proxy or using VPN - Rotate through new IPs.

**Questions:**

* Is it even practical or necessary to worry about preventative measures for such a low-key crawler? If so, how robust should my crawler be to detection?

* In your opinion, what is the single most prudent approach I should consider?

* What kinds of honeypots could be present and how can I identify them?

**Problems:**

* MDs are totally ignorant of statistical science (this is an understatement)
* MDs are usually unable to use software correctly (yes, even simple software)
* MDs want things done automagically

&amp;nbsp;

**Project:**

* Medical research follows standard methodology with established standards of practice on the output, which we would therefore deliver depending on the user input data.
* Input data introspection to attempt to derive a correct statistical model.
* Develop the simplest possible interface (an interactive MCQ, maybe? MDs are used to that...), to output a standardized, correct result.
* Automate to the max.
* Accept any kind of file/data
* Make it output a written standard summary of results, with tables and figures, as a basis to the methods/results/discussion parts of a research manuscript. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:**
Having recently been involved into a lot of clinical medical research, I have witnessed *absolute incompetence* regarding all stages of research (project planning, data collection, analysis, reporting results...). The problem is that MDs are strongly encouraged to conduct such projects, and you can trust me when I say that maybe 5% of them have the slightest understanding of what they are doing. Literature abounds on how to conduct research, but standardization and automation is lacking. Needless to say, medical research is littered with copy-paste errors and is generally far from reproducible. This leads to endless debates over the application of the results of poor quality studies in the clinics.",2,16

Hello /r/datascience. I'm going to keep this short and sweet.

I am currently studying for a PhD in Mechanical Engineering: my work focuses on data-driven signal processing for fault diagnostics and prognosistics of wind turbine drivetrain components using multivariate feature selection, machine learning techniques, and dimensionality reduction for data visualisation on vast amounts of data sources such as vibration, acoustic emission, hydraulic pressure/temperature, wind speed, humidity, generator electronics etc. I carry out most of my work in Python and R after ditching MATLAB partway through my undergrad degree.

The further I get with my work the less I care about the mechanical engineering implication of the analysis and more on the mathematical/CS background of the techniques I work with and what else it can be applied to, and that I don't have any academic background in these areas other than what I pursue independently as part of my PhD. Lately I've been having a bit of a crisis wondering whether I should have done an AI or maybe stats MSc out of my undergrad and pursued a more CS oriented PhD.

Application season for postgraduate courses is approaching here in the UK and I'm contemplating whether changing my academic route will help my career goals as a data scientist.

What are your thoughts?

Let's say you had a wedding and each of the guests gave a gift. Since they're not the most sentimental lot everyone gives cash. The gifts range between $5 and $200. Afterwards, being the cold calculating couple you are, you wanted to find out which side of the family was more generous on average. 

After calculating you notice the bride's family was much more generous giving about $20 more per gift. But upon further investigation, you notice that the Bride's uncle gave $2000. no one else's gift came close. 

My question is the following. Do you ignore the uncle's gift? The bride's side of the family still gave about $5 more per gift if you leave it out. if leaving the gift out had the opposite effect, making the groom's side more generous by about $5 per gift, would your answer be different? what is the best practice when you have a huge difference by a single data point?

My problem was that it is hard to find collaborations for research (here I mean strictly research for the goal of publishing academic paper). I know there are a lot of people who want to learn data science and have some free time on hands (in places like Kaggle). I also know that there are ways to track exactly how much people are contributing to the research (using tools like github). So I think it is totally possible to start an internet-based collaboration in which contributors can be fairly and accurately credited for their effort.

So this collaboration will be similar to open source software development but it is for collaborative data science research and problem fix. The collaboration will be hosted on Github with specific structure, like there will be a place to open a shared lab notebook, paper writing, issue discussion. People will work on the dataset, contributing some graphs, descriptive analytics, text descriptions of the data, predictive models, and so on. And the works will be done on a set of central files, which are moderated by a few members who control github pull request. We develop the story for publishing together. The paper writing process is also hosted on github using traceable LaTex or markdown format.

When its time to credit authors, we look at github statistics for contributors. People who had top contributions (according to some criteria like the number of lines of codes/writing) will be listed as an author on the paper (of course if they consent). Others who have not contributed much can also be listed in the acknowledgement.

I know it will be a hell lot of management work. But just think it could be a powerful concept. What do you guys think? Would you participate in a project like this? If not, why?",6,2

At a picnic party my uncle told me this was his rule of thumb.  Our discussion was about how do you know if a study is reliable, useful, or just garbage.  He's not a statistician. He keeps up with politics and is generally a smart person though.

What is your feeling about it, as someone who actually probably has some decent statistical skills?  Can you come up with a simple illustrative example or two, to make your case?

I'm not decided yet.  So let me get that out of the way. I am listening to all good arguments.  

What I can say right now is this: The p-value is a probability. It helps inform us whether the effect on the outcome from this factor was due to chance (luck) or actual signal (skill).  The p-value only helps to inform because it is not a guarantee.  Particularly, in scenarios of multiple testing the raw p-value is really far from informative on its own and multiple testing corrections are essential.

The effect size is the magnitude of the coefficient on the factor.  It's independent of the p-value. The effect size is only interpretable in comparison to the other coefficients and makes no sense at all in isolation such as 70%.  In a multiple term parametric model, for example plain old multiple linear regression, the effect size of 0.7 might be smaller than the other coefficients, or it could be larger than the other coefficients.  Moreover, the p-value could be low or high, indicating significance or insignificance, for the term having 0.7 for the coefficient, even if it's the largest coefficient of all the terms in the parametric model!",5,5

I've been set the audacious task of deriving a formula for a set of electrochemical gas sensors! My mathematical background is limited, and I've recently acquired ""Machine Learning, a Probabilistic Perspective"" by Kevin Murphy, and been told to investigate caffenet. However, I'm finding the book extremely difficult to work through, as I have no idea what I'm doing, nor exactly which algorithms/approaches are suitable for this task.

The company I work for make various environmental gas sensors testing gas concentrations such as NO, CO etc. and my boss thinks that it may be possible to improve their accuracy using Machine Learning techniques. Yep, I'm a bit of a newcomer to this, and I'm not sure if what he is asking is even possible, as we don't even have the ground truth yet.

He has provided me with datasets- a lot of datasets- for the gas sensors. However, there is no reference data. So I have no idea if the sensors or performing accurately or not. We have no statistical model at the minute, all we have is an output in millvolts, that seems to be buffered around by changes in temperature and humidity.

Without any reference data, this seems to be some sort of ""unsupervised regression"" problem, or so it seems. Is what he is asking even possible? Given the amount of data I have, I feel I can do something...

Some of these are questions I have personally asked data analyst and data science applicants that have come through my company and others are ones I have taken from various sites or borrowed from others. The goal of this post is to promote thoughtful discussion around how to answer some of these questions, while providing some sense of what hiring managers may look for when interviewing. Some will have a right and wrong answer, others won't. And some will be easier than others.

Have fun and enjoy!! :)

* Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization methods? 

* Tell me the difference between an inner join, left join/right join, and union?

* Estimate the number of 'Happy Birthday' posts that are logged on Facebook everyday.

* You have a data set containing 100K rows, and 100 columns, with one of those columns being our dependent variable for a problem we'd like to solve. How can we quickly identify which columns will be helpful in predicting the dependent variable. Identify two techniques and explain them to me as though I were 5 years old.

* What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important in data science?

* What are your 3 favorite data visualization techniques?

* How do you handle missing data?

* Explain the 80/20 rule, and tell me about it's importance in model validation.

* In your opinion, which is more important when designing a machine learning model: Model performance? or model accuracy?

* What is one way that you would handle an imbalanced data set that's being used for prediction? (i.e. vastly more negative classes than positive classes.)

* Explain the following parts of a linear regression to me: p-value, coefficient, R-Squared value. What is the significance of each of these components and what assumptions do we hold when creating a linear regression?

* Given tweets and Facebook statuses surrounding a new movie that was recently released, how will you determine the public's reaction to the movie? 

* Explain like I'm 5: K-Means clustering algorithm.

* I have two models of comparable accuracy and computational performance. Which one should I choose for production and why?

* What is your favorite thing about data science?

I'm applying for a data science internship with a well known company in the SF area (think Uber/Airbnb/Pinterest etc.). One of their points under 'Qualifications' is 'Must be currently pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree. Preferred fields of study are statistics, math, economics, or related discipline.'

This presents a few problems. Namely, that I'm a junior undergraduate studying CS.

That said, I have more experience than the typical undergrad (and, from what I've seen, the typical masters student with respect to data science). Here's what I've got going for me:

* Very proficient using Python, R, and SQL (among many other data analysis/science tools).

* Just finished a summer internship at a well-known tech company as a data science intern. Built the company's new anomaly detection system in R from the ground up and deployed it.

* Just started a fall data science internship in NYC with an e-commerce company. Will be working on customer segmentation with some SQL reports and machine learning.

* Taking two data science masters courses.

* Tutoring for a masters-level algorithms course.

I know I don't fit their exact description, but do you think I should apply anyways? I'd love to intern here and would appreciate any tips/experiences any of you have had on applying where you don't necessarily meet every single criteria.

Thanks!

I pulled data from IPUMS to help inform a project my team is working on. The questions my colleague wants to answer are about presence of children in households by race of householder by units in structure. This is not a pre-packaged Census/ACS table, so I am turning to the PUMS data.

However, Im a little unsure of my analysis, as this is the first time Ive really used the PUMS data to prepare a custom table. I dont have anyone at my workplace to turn to for double-checking my work, so I hope this forum might help answer my question.

To summarize, I was able to extract the 26,000+ person records (12,000+ housing records) of the five primary PUMAs of the city I'm looking at (Portland, OR). Then I did some recoding (e.g., units in structure reduced to multi-family, single-family, other; and whether the household has children). Then I kept the householder record and put that in a pivot table. I then summed the HHWT (household weight) field. My results seem right, but Im not sure if this was the correct way to do this.

One person I asked, who admitted they don't really use HHWT field so they don't really know, said I should not have kept only one record per household. But this doesn't seem to agree with the advice on the HHWT documentation.

An additional question I have is whether the HHWT field should sum to the total number of households within the PUMAs selected. If so, it seems my HHWT field is under-counting the number of households/units. The sum of my HHWT field (one record per household) is 224,876 (using 2014 5-yr ACS), but using the data in FactFinder the total housing units comes to 224,876, and the occupied unit count is 251,512. Why is there a discrepancy?

[Here](http://data.answerbase.com/AnswerBase/mpcitdemo.answerbase.com/UserFiles/Answers201609/questionImage-1-13090905-full.jpg) is the table I came up with. Would anyone be able to check my numbers or general approach? Thank you for reading.",0,3

How to build/rebuild a proper math background for data science?

My background :
BBA with around 1/3 of math (calculus, proba up to Khi square testing if memory serves well)
MBA with minor computing, and some math (graph, sets, Boolean maths)
I left school 11 years ago, never had to use the math part.

I need to rebuild Algebra, Calculus, stats and probability at entry level before I can move to next steps I suppose. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Most questions here seem to be made by people with decent math educstion/foundation background, so my question is how to self teach all this?

I would prefer books, as Mooc can be a bit slow paved and therefore time consuming, as well as ways to have corrected exercises 

I'm currently on the DS specialization on Coursera, and about to start the stats part of it, and I'm not confident on my background.

For a project I have, I want to play with a somehow large dataset (almost 20GBs) on a remote VM (4G of RAM, 1 CPU). By play I mean run some ML &amp; NLP kind of  jobs, where the data needs to be searchable (for data mining and analysis purposes). The data is in (loose) JSON format (gziped JSON), and I want to proceed with python and maybe pandas (and other python tools that may come handy, like scikit-learn and gensim).

My question comes down to the data format and how to handle it. Do I need to reformat the data or could I proceed with the way they are now? And because of the jobs that I want to run, I would need to transform the data into *bag of words* kind of structures and/or sparse matrices.  In this case how should I handle my data? There are also memory limitations (about 15GBs unused memory) that I should be considering.

In this case I was interested in seeing how the Netflix show Stranger Things may have impacted references to Dungeons and Dragons.

I started with looking at the Twitter API or other products like Tweepy but I hadn't realize that the Twitter API doesn't let you analyze anything older than 7-8 days old.

I found Hashtagify, which let's me look back up to 2 months and compare specific hashtags on Twitter, but I was really hoping there'd be a way to see a larger window and see trends before the show came out as well. Is this possible without spending money?

I'm curious to hear your experiences with automatized data science.

Let's say my input is a clean dataset with known data types (i.e. I know exactly what kind of data it is and that machine learning classifiers are generally applicable in this domain, but I don't know the specific dataset), and I want a script that automatically selects a classification method (e.g. regression, random forests, or neural nets), fits models, does parameter tuning, selects the best model, and then tells me what the best model is, whether it is reliable, and what variables had the most impact.

I think most of us would agree that this does not make sense when you don't know what kind of data you're getting, and that the results would never be guaranteed to be ""perfect"" as you have to rely on heuristics, but I think this approach could still work reasonably well if the data sources are known and clean (after all, non-automatized data science is never perfect either).

Some possible points for discussion:

- What's your experience with these approaches?

- Any software that you would recommend (e.g. IBM Watson Analytics, Google Prediction API?)? Anything that works well with python or R and is open source?

- What kind of classification methods do you think are suitable for this approach? Is it too soon to do this with neural networks?

- You should probably set a threshold for the minimum amount of observations in the dataset before you allow this approach. And maybe you don't want to allow data that is heavily imbalanced. Any other possible criteria like these that come to mind?

- Any experiences with automatic feature engineering?

The processed data is formatted for github commit frequency per 15 minute period. That is, each row in the time series tells us how many commits there were for those 15 minutes, starting august 1st, 2015 ending ~sept 11 2016 (missing jan 31 2016).

Pretty cool! Couple of things of interest:

- That spike at [period 7675](http://i.imgur.com/GO6tEoR.png) (which translates roughly to October 20th, 2015, 0:00 UTC). What caused it, I do not know. I did some research and couldn't find anything.

- The dip around 13000-15000 is the holiday periods. Programmers are people, too.

- The only way I can explain the drop from 33000 to the end is that the data quality dropped. [Alexa disagrees with lower github usage](http://i.imgur.com/TeqsSva.png) in that period. If you want to do serious analysis, you might want to cut that period out.

More fun graphs:

- [A monday-friday work week on github](http://i.imgur.com/hzlD3EP.png). Note seasonality in the days. Note friday night droppind lower.

- [Two months on GitHub](http://i.imgur.com/Q6f6PNI.png). Notice those two days a week with drastically lower usage? Yep, that's the weekend. People on Github tend to 9-to-5ers. They also tend to do fuckall on saturdays, and do a little coding on sundays.

- Did the july 20th stackoverflow outage affect github commits? [Doesn't seem like it](http://i.imgur.com/5dVOPt6.png) (outage starts at period 59 here and ends at period 61). In fact, none of the [5 stack overflow outages in the dataset](http://currentlydown.com/stackoverflow.com#2016-09-16) seem to have an effect at all.

2) Senior Statistical Analyst for a large corporation. Position involves heavier use of statistics, and in particular text analytics/NLP. R seems to be the tool of choice here (they say they've got a way to deal with big data in R). Some people on the team are mainly responsible for the data munging, I would not be one of those people. In a small town in the south, so it may be harder to get work in NYC later on. A related issue is that vacation/holidays are relatively limited in this position (10 days vaca + 6 holidays, keeping in mind that I'd have to fly to see family so not a lot of time to interview out of state).

Considerations: 

I have an MS in applied statistics, BS in economics. I'm already a heavy R user, since that was what the professors in grad school liked to use. I have very, very limited Python or SQL knowledge. I'm wondering if it's better to widen my skillset by taking the route that is Python/SQL but hardly any statistics (I have tried but just cannot seem to get myself to learn these unless there is a real, non-Kaggle-esque task to be done) or if I'm better off specializing in NLP and getting better at being a statistician.

The concept is simple enough, I'm envisioning a system where a picture of a character (right now I'm thinking just numerical characters 0-9, but I could expand this to all lower case characters if this too simple or something) is uploaded, and the system guesses what character it is. This could expand to the system giving a percentage chance of how sure it is, also giving 2nd best and 3rd best answers etc.

My question is how difficult would this be? I'm currently pretty much a noob at ML/Data Science stuff. I have no experience with TensorFlow or any of that other stuff (obviously I will have to learn). I'm in about week 3 of Andrew Ng's Coursera course in ML, and I do have some experience with Octave (from the course). I do have a fair amount of experience with programming in general (Java, C++)

I'm under no delusions that I'd be able to complete the project now, or even soon. I know I will have to do a lot of learning/researching to be able to complete it. But how feasible do you think the project is? I'm looking to complete it in about ~50-100 hours worth of time. 

So what do you think? Is it too easy/hard given my current complete newbiness? Do you have any tips in general with the digit recognizer project? Thanks in advance for your help.

Edit: Also, I imagine I will need a lot of data for the training set...would it be possible to source this data myself (i.e get people irl to write numbers for me) or would I have to find some dataset online due to the massive amount of data required?",5,1

More recently, I am interested in using Python for data analysis, so I wrote up a learning project plan (https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice). I know there are a few basic areas that I need to get better to become proficient, but I want solicit feedbacks from seasoned Pandas / Python users to see if I am missing anything. 

For those who have a lot of experiences, I would also love to hear about your learning progression and learning path.

Basically, I have an image that is colour scaled and I'd really like to extract the numerical data from it at a few points. I have a reference scale at the side of the image. My idea of doing it is to convert to grayscale in MATLAB and then doing some sort of conversion based on that but not sure if that would be considered good practice.

I think it would really help to see how real data scientists work and to see how other people investigate, and I am told that in programming in general many people say that reviewing code is one of the best ways to improve.

I've found that people publish their code on Kagggle often, but Kaggle competitions do not seem very complex and I'm wondering if anyone knows more complex analysis I can read through (which isn't purely predictive either)?

I would like to start a thread on interesting questions that could be solved, and hopefully this could be added on further based on your own curiosity. 

The topics would range across disciplines and industry, aimed to get a wide array of opinions that affect our generation or future. In other words, these should be the burning questions we need answers to for those still on this Earth. Top voted messages will be added to the top :)

If these questions are addressed with scientific backing or research with significant p-value etc... please link them here for the benefit of the community's learning!

Here are questions I thought it would be cool to work on, and the reasons why to start things off:

1. Is there a positive, linear relationship between people aged &gt;55 who are NOT diagnosed with Alzheimer's/Dementia and those who are have not trained in STEM subjects for &gt;5 years?
(Reason: A few years in STEM training/subjects might 'reinforce' the neuroconnections, reducing the likelyhood of getting Alzheimer's or Dementia. This is contrary to various scientific studies attributing the condition to other reasons, such as heredity, normal aging process, 'savant'-type brains and alot more. For the sake of brevity, I'll keep this generic)
EDITED - feedback by /r/Manonamustard, please see his reply for his full answer.

2. Did changes to types/quality/quantity of coolants in air conditioning and refrigerator systems make a difference in global warming and/or ozone? Was the difference a positive or negative effect? Were there even changes @_@
(Reason: I'm no physics, engineering or chemistry major, but I always wanted to know if the coolants used were changed due to perhaps an ISO standard over time, and did these actually impact the environment in a good way. We never seem to know what goes in these equipments but take them for granted!)
EDITED - feedback by /r/SnakeOiler: Google Freon and CFCs!

3. What is the mean or median lag of monetary and fiscal policies' effect on the economy? (e.g. By country's QE, LIBOR, Printing, Debt)
(Reason: It is always a range, such as 1,1.5 or 2 years of delay, but what is the actual mean or median, and were there changes over time? I thought it would be interesting to know if certain countries of an economic 'maturity' would have similar lag periods.)

Three for now, more to come later. Thanks for your curiosity and attention!",9,9

Just putting this out there to see if there is any interest. 

I've been on a data science learning journey for the past several years, and made some good progress last year on a foundational R bootcamp. Since then, although I have all the tools and there's more than enough free resources online, I've been unable to focus on building any one project or learning any single skill because there is just so much to learn.

I thought what might help is a monthly study group on a particular topic, for example, a specific python library, or building d3.js vis, or working with SQL using python/R, or learning how to use a particular analysis method etc. We would focus on just that topic for the month and show off our work at the end of the month. 

The format could be similar to a book club or photography prompt of the week etc.

If something similar already exists, please post in the comments.

Thoughts?

I am in an interesting situation where I am the resident of an ultra-renewable energy home (for research purposes).  

We are collecting electricity usage data from *every* outlet, *every* appliance, and *every* load in the home.  We are also collecting flow meter reading from just about every faucet and water source in the home.  So we also know how much water is being used (and where it is being used).  I have months and months of data, down to the **average power usage per minute**.

Obviously, from a research perspective, this is a gold-mine of data.

I am performing a self-study of machine learning and data analytics, and I am interested in seeing how I can use this data to help me answer questions about the home.  I was wondering if any of you smarter people than I, have any good questions that may be answerable using this data and machine learning/pattern recognition algorithms?

For example, there is a concept called [energy disaggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonintrusive_load_monitoring) (aka, non-intrusive load monitoring), which takes a whole-home energy signal and separates it into the component appliances / loads.  

Since I have the signals (inputs) and loads (my classification targets), I think that it would be pretty straightforward to develop a disaggregation algorithm using a basic LMS algorithm.

But I was wondering if any of you had any interesting questions that could be answered using ML or pattern recognition for this type of application.",5,2

I am a data scientist working for a hospitality consulting firm where I mostly work in Python and R (with a little bit of Excel to share information/results). I am responsible for creating things like pricing algorithms, predicting seasonal effects, and predicting potential markets for expansion by mixing our data, our clients data, and 3rd party data then applying ML/statistical methods to produce classifiers/recommendations.

I think that we could significantly scale our business by providing smaller players with these same kinds of tools but I have no experience productionalizing them. What I mean is that while I can do the math, write the classifiers, and report/explain our results to clients Im not familiar with things like hosting an external sql server, having an algo live in an external server (AWS for example), and writing a web front-end for our lower tier clients. 

I have been doing some research on google and have some ideas (use flask, docker, aws), Im yet to find any comprehensive tutorial(not really sure this is the correct term) on the subject. Do any of you have any suggestions for reading materials on the subject?

Thanks!

I'm trying to get started in data science, so I downloaded the Titanic train and test data from Kaggle.  I'm trying to practice data analysis using Excel (among R and Python), but I just had a general question:

How do I deal with missing values?  

For example, I'm trying to create a new column ""Age Class"" with child, teen, young adult, adult, and senior (let me know if this is unnecessary lol), but there are some missing values in the ""Age"" column. 

I've been told that using the median of the age is a good number to replace the missing values, but I do not understand why.  I feel like it can give misleading information as to who survived or not.  

If a row has a missing value, is it okay to delete that entire row?  Can deleting 10 rows out of a 900 row sample make a big difference?
