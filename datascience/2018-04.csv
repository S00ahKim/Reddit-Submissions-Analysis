The project's goal is to build a binary classifier based off of a bunch of raw text data.

Here's generally how things looked:

1. Perform pre-processing on text (remove stopwords and punctuation and stem words)

2. Split the data train-test.

3. Create a subset of data containing the ""1""-rows  i.e., the text associated with the positive class

4. Create a document-term matrix on the subset from 3 (this uses scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` class)

4. Transform the train and test datasets using the vocabulary from step 4. The vocabulary for the train and test datasets are now only the words associated with the positive class.

5. Build and evaluate a model...

I am confused as to steps 3-5... I think his logic in selecting only the features associated with the positive class (i.e. the class we're trying to identify) and then only considering those features/that vocabulary for the training and testing of a given ML model was to basically identify, based off the text associated with the positive class, what really predicts a document's being positive.

This doesn't sit right with me -- throwing out many words that aren't associated with the positive class (and are rather predictive of the negative class) seems wrong.

But this approach also seems solid, because you would only be including the relevant features for determining the positive-class rows. If a given row doesn't have many of these features populated, then it's likely to be in the negative class.

Thoughts from anyone?",3,6

I am trying to join the Morningstar file with the company file  based on fund name so that I can match the fund name from the company report to the correct quarterly data that's on the Morningstar report.  

The issue is the way the fund is written is slightly different on both reports. An example is:

FID FREEDOM K 2020
There's also the issue with the symbol that find/replace doesn't pick up on.

The only thing both reports have in common is the fund name. Unfortunately there is no ticker on the company report or there wouldn't be an issue (since the ticker is on Morningstar).

Is there any way to reasonably standardize the name or join these tables? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",0,1

It's basically a collection of points in 2D space that determine where your important face features - like this: https://www.learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Facial-Feature-Detection.jpg

Question.. I'm trying to determine if the mount is ""moving"" across a series of frames in a video. How would you guys go about determining that?  The tricky part is that the face could be moving.. so the face could be (but in my case, not very often) rotated, it could be turned slightly, or zooming in and out (i.e. person moving towards camera). So i guess you could look at the cluster of mouth points with respect to cluster of nose (or eye) points.

Any ideas?",3,3

Here's thew deal, I have been a data scientist for about 8  and months and previously spent 2years in grad school for applied mathematics - the commonality here is that I write lots of code (let's say scripts actually... I'm not a real  programmer). So I'm starting at my computer screen a lot, sometimes all day when I lose track of time. I use dark- themed IDEs and what not but I've heard about computer glasses and was wondering if anyone uses them. I do not wear glasses normally but my eyes can feel very dry and tired after a long day and I'd like to try and mitigate that strain.

a parameter space;

a method for searching or sampling candidates;

**A CROSS VALIDATION SCHEME**; and

a score function.""

Can I confirm with you guys then that i would only need to perform a gridsearch and specify the argument ""cv"" = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3) as an example? 

If so, I would not need to first separately perform cross validation and then hyperparam optimisation using gridsearch?

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/LMCH9JW.png) is a sample spreadsheet. 

Originally, I was just going to use the [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), but I'd really like the measure to take into consideration the number of interactions as well as the overlap (Kelly-Allison should be weighted more than Craig-John, IMO). I looked into using the [SrensenDice index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), but that doesn't really seem to solve my problem. 

I've debated just multiplying the Jaccard Index by the number of interactions (w_Jaccard), which solves my issue but I am not sure if that is a common/acceptable solution to this problem.

Does anyone have any experience or ideas?

What is the best way to shape a table for analysis or to pass into an algorithm (like decision tree)? What resources can I read to inform this decision?

**Option 1**: group ***Table 2*** by Tutor and aggregate student data, then merge to ***Table 1***. This produces a clean table with one row per tutor, but it reduces the fidelity of student data.

**Option 2**: merge ***Table 1*** and ***Table 2*** without aggregation. This preserves student-level data and duplicates the tutor attributes over the rows of the students they tutor. Consequently this over-represents the attributes of tutors who work with more students.

I'm in a bit of a rough situation. Im a little over my head with a DS project that I've been assigned in a graduate statistics seminar. For brief background, I'm finishing a doctoral music degree but am taking a data science class through the statistics department at my current university since I am interested in switching fields (like everyone else). I have my Bachelor's in Mathematics so I'm not starting at ground zero, but can't claim I have any mastery of statistics. My intention with this post is not at all to ask for homework help or just be fed solutions, but I'm starting to exhaust all my current resources. 

The project itself:
We're assigned a data set from the UCI machine learning repository and tasked with coming up with a thorough analysis (six-ish pages) using techniques we've covered in class (although outside techniques are allowed too). 

So far we've briefly talked about
-regression trees/random forest
-Naive Bayes (applied to a spam filter)
-KNN
-PCA

My specific data is located here if anyone is interested: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Educational+Process+Mining+%28EPM%29%3A+A+Learning+Analytics+Data+Set

So far I've been working in R to arrange all the data to be viewable/usable, but I have zero experience working with
a) such a large data set
b) applying machine learning techniques to nonlinear time series sets

I've been dilligently working in DataCamp and other online resources to supplement my R knowledge, but I haven't encountered anything to help me wrangle time series logs like the ones in this set. If anyone has any recommendations for machine learning techniques that could be applied to this type of data to point me in the right direction I would be extremely grateful. My main interest is if some of the measurements could predict scores or final grades for the assignments, but I'm unsure what the scope of that would entail. My current plan now is to group the data into three subsets based on which students took the final exam, pick two contrasting students (high grade/ low grade) from each subset and chart their path to look for consistency in their measurements of the Educational Process recordings. 

I can happily provide the R code I have so far for basic usability (github link: https://github.com/Alecd2/EPM-Dataset-2).

The professor stated he will purposefully be taking a hands-off approach to this project to treat it like a job assignment, but my severe lack of experience is making this a pretty difficult task. Thanks to anyone who read through all of this!",2,6

I bring my question to a forum comprised of people who use whatever data is available to leverage analytical insights to make a living.

Why is everyone freaking out about the Facebook / Camrbdige Analytica story?  What am I missing?

This is how I understand the situation (and my DS comments in parentheses):

1.  A researcher/organization created a survey.  Researcher/organization deployed survey to a data harvesting platform, Facebook.  Users willingly took the survey.  Researcher/organization collected/compiled data.  (This seems fine to me.  I regularly send out surveys to customers/patients/clients and match their survey responses to other data I have on them. Respondents willingly took survey and shared data.  Maybe the fiasco is because they weren't aware of the aim?)
2.  Same researcher/organization also scraped publicly available Facebook data from users taking survey including friends data, interests, geographic location, age, and other features.   Probably also collected other publicly available data for same individuals and compiled data together.  (I regularly scrape publicly available data from disparate sources all the time.....again is the fiasco because they didn't know what the aim was?)
3.  Researcher/organization did the whole 'data science thing' [tongue in cheek comment for us!] and discovered insights and associations between survey data and other Facebook data.  (This is what we are literally paid to do and why we command our positions/salaries.)
4.  Insights/associations were eventually used to target people to influence their political views.  (Data gathering -&gt; magic -&gt; rollout... seems standard. Difference is it's political.)

Yes yes there are other tiny tidbits, but is this the main story?  **If so, isn't this just a job well done?  Isn't this what we are literally paid to do?**

Is it 'too far' because it was political?  If so, how is this different from any other targeted political campaign ad on FB (or any other social platform)?

Is the fiasco because people's information was scraped without them explicitly being told?  

Is the fiasco because people didn't know what the survey was going to be necessarily used for? (Assuming the original researcher had any clue, either.)

Is the fiasco on the harvesting part? Or the analytical part? Or the rollout part? Or all of it?  Is it because it was just slimy overall?  I'm just confused.

Maybe I've been in the DS world for too long and therefore my views are a little warped but .... isn't this literally what we are paid to do?  Do research, find insights, leverage insights, and make better decisions?  Many of us have dedicated hours to training ourselves on how to scrape publicly available data or data mine API's.

I understand that the more academic data scientists here might be very shocked at the methodology given that their research goes through ethics boards and IRB's where there are a million consent forms.... but the attitude and approaches are wildly different in the private sector.  In my experience in the private sector, everything goes -- so long as it's not illegal.

What am I missing?

It's got predictors like : Paid last 6M 0/1, Charge off Balance, Months since last paid, Months since charge off, Phonecontactavailable etc.

The response variables I have are 6 month liquidation(0-100%), 12 month liquidation (0-100%), and Paid in the Last 6 months (0/1). What I'm trying to predict is its liquidation over the next 6-12 months in collections, and a yes/no 0/1 IF an account makes at least one payment over the next 6 months. 

So far I've use linear regression to predict 6 month liquidation, and my optimal model has a mean error of about 10%. However, the mean liquidation % is about 16% so this is a bit high.

I've also found that using a logistic regression to predict if the client will make a collections payment (0/1 yes no) can predict with an accuracy of 70-71%. I'm using multiple training/test sets for each with a 50/50 split.

These are OK numbers, but not stellar by any means. I was wondering if there were any other data mining techniques I could use to possibly predict to greater accuracy. I was thinking about predicting both responses with a K-NN algorithm, and possibly trying out a randomforest/decision tree classification approach.

If anyone has any other ideas or advice it would be much appreciated. I can answer any questions about the data as well.

Im a math grad student getting ready to graduate and looking for careers with CS. I recently took a machine learning course(Andrew Ng-Stanford-Coursera) and I was hoping to use one of the learning algorithms and programming assignments as my masters project requirement. I felt the amount of math used for deriving the cost function in SVM and the gaussian kernel would be enough for my spam classifier to pass as a math project but I feel my advisor doesnt feel that way. 

There are no hard requirements in my dept for the project and I feel Ill still pass this requirement by just doing a presentation on SVM but I was wondering if time permits, if I could add more math to the existing project to make it more impressive to the math audience. 

I dont have too much time left in the semester but my thought was to maybe just use Markov chain  for text prediction. I just didnt know how to incorporate it as a feature. 

I know Markov chain is used for spam classification on its own which gets rid of my elaborate  SVM model but I want to use both some how.

How that programming assignment is structured is that it takes a data set of spam and non spam emails, normalizes, regularizes it etc and then after prepossessing makes a vocabulary list of based on most frequently used words. These later become features. How these words are selected is they select all words that exist at least 100 times in each email. I was wondering if I could squeeze in Markov chan by using them to make this vocabulary list that later leads to feature vector but Im not sure how.

Another thought was to just leave the vocabulary list as is but add Markov chain prediction as a featureof its own instead.

Any suggestion on how to do either of these is appreciated

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask for some help in my interview process but I thought I'd give it a shot as I need some new eyes on this task I've been asked to complete (I've finished everything else, but this one's been a bitch). It's a bit of a lengthy post but I promise you'll an extreme help to me and my family if I can nail this correctly.
&amp;nbsp;

The purpose of this post is to verify issues I've ran into with the data format of this spreadsheet or if I'm too focused on the format and there's still enough info to make some good business insights by just pivoting out the information that I need. (I'll include screenshots for visualization purposes)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



They gave me an excel spreadsheet with survey responses and have asked me to conduct an analysis of this set of data and write a half page of my key findings. These can be as simple as average, mode, median, correlations, etc. Sounds easy right? I thought so too, until I opened it and found this messy spreadsheet. So bare with me as I speak on what problems I've run into so far.

&amp;nbsp;

1\. An initial problem I ran into...
&gt;(Unless their inputted notes say otherwise) 

&gt;if a cell shows -2 = Unknown or -1 = Not Applicable.
&amp;nbsp;

- Isn't this a problem if I want to create a scatter plot or calculate an average? All of these [-2s and -1s] (https://imgur.com/a/7o51d) are going to completely throw my graphs and calculations for a loop. 

- Wouldn't it be easier to leave blank or input N/A or No Response? 
- There's ""over 2 billion"" in column F which is the only alphanumeric response in this entire spreadsheet, shouldn't this be cleaned up to be only numeric?

&amp;nbsp;

2\. I'm not sure the necessity of having [row 2](https://imgur.com/a/aCyyK) if they're going to just throw random shit (Column C) in the titles of these columns not to mention the various layouts of these headers make my brain hurt. 

&amp;nbsp;

You may be asking yourself, ""but Trittles why in the *FUCK* are sales measured in single digits, what is Dollar average, and why am I still reading this post?"" 

&amp;nbsp;

Yes, these are all great questions! I love you for sticking it out this far, I hope we can be friends! *At this point I want to make sure that I'm not overanalyzing the spreadsheet itself thus straying away from the assignment's intended purpose of pulling useful insights out of the data; however, I think the data needs cleaning (please tell me if I'm wrong about this)* 

&amp;nbsp;

3\. Anyway, allow me to try and answer your (and my) questions by showing you their inputted notes for the [Sales and Dollar average columns] (https://imgur.com/a/AkiBv).
&amp;nbsp;

- I don't understand the need to categorize the sales numbers whenever it's already numeric data.
 
- I also do not understand their explanation as to what ""Dollar average"" is... I need an adult for this one apparently.

&amp;nbsp;

4\. I've got an issue with the next section of [headers...](https://imgur.com/a/56WZa)
&amp;nbsp;

- Why have ""01"" in front of every header? 

When looking at what they're measuring they have Turnover Corporate Exempt, Non Exempt, Corp Overall. 

- If they measured how many [operations employees](https://imgur.com/a/0pLaF) each company has then why not have a ""Operations Turnover"" percentage? The Non exempt column can include corporate and operations. I don't see the need of this figure.

&amp;nbsp;

5\. Hang in there, just a few more left. These next couple of sections are about which [bonuses](https://imgur.com/a/PU2kj) each company offers. 

- My only question with this area is what would be the difference between inputting a ""1"" vs a ""2""? Is the company not sure if they'll continue just putting down a 1? Seems like redundant information.

&amp;nbsp;

6\. There's a similar [next section](https://imgur.com/a/3jn6g) that measures each respective benefit's effectiveness. 

- I don't quite understand what is being used to determine effectiveness other than word of mouth? Nothing quantitative is being measured here.

&amp;nbsp;

7\. LASTLY we have everyone's respective [bonus percentages](https://imgur.com/a/POOX7). ^Nasty ^headers ^incoming

- Same point as in the beginning. Will all of the ""-1""s throw off any kind of numerical correlation I try to make with another metric from the spreadsheet?


&amp;nbsp;

So give it to me straight. Am I just being picky or do you think that this company purposely gave me a nasty spreadsheet to see what I can do with it. I don't want to put in my analysis that the layout of this data should be changed/cleaned before any insights can be made if that's not what the company is looking for. If you thing they gave it to me to clean up then analyze, I will certainly nit pick the data itself as hard as I can. I can't thank you guys enough for coming on this adventure with me, I've been staring at this thing for a couple of days and really needed more than the blank stare my wife has given me. Let me know if you'd like the file (PM me) or if I should post this in another sub. Much love my dudes. You're all wizards.

&amp;nbsp;


Tldr: Prospective company gave me a dirty little spreadsheet, do I tell them it's too dirty for me or what good info could one pull from this? ",1,0

After months of applying for jobs, I was lucky enough to get a call back for a HR Insights Analyst role within HR (I assume). I interviewed with the hiring manager over the phone and felt pretty good about the interview. After a two-week hiatus I was contacted from the company referring me for another position they felt I was a better fit for in their data science department.

Enter interview for Data Mining Analyst. 

I was sent the requirements for the role, which in my opinion seems vague and extremely broad. They also seemed geared towards an entry level position. Here They are below:

* Understand and implement data-driven applications and advanced analytical solutions that leverage predictive analytics, data
mining techniques, machine learning, open source tools, orchestration tools, Python, R, Spark etc.

* Leverage analytical experience to develop analytical solutions using appropriate tools and technology to solve complex
analytical problems.

* 4 year degree or equivalent experience and 2 to 4 years of relevant functional experience; BA/BS or MS in an analytic discipline preferred

* Ability to take complex business analyses and projects from concept to completion and make the results accessible and relevant to business users at all levels

* Self-starter and motivated with a strong attention to detail and commitment to meeting timelines and operating from a sense of urgency.

* Analytical experience with either Python, R, Spark, Java, Scala or another Big Data technology/platform.

* Understanding of analytical tools (e.g. APT, dunnhumby, Tableau, MicroStrategy, Alteryx, etc.)

Ive already interviewed with the hiring manager over the phone and next I am interviewing with the other analysts over the phone. From there I would be invited on-site to interview. Because I havent used Python or R since Ive graduated, I should probably sharpen those skills. I also thought it was interesting there was no mention of SQL, which is something I am comfortable with but would also need to brush up on. I did a short 6-week course in Tableau / Data Visualization and work in Power BI daily so I fully understand how to use prominent analytical tools.  

Im worried because the role seems pretty entry level I might be overlooking something because I am confident I meet the requirements of the role. Is there anything I should focus on? Are there any resources anyone recommends?

Wanted to ask here because I've been following this sub for months and it seems like most people in the field recommend (or consider it to be mandatory) that one obtains an MS in Statistics or DS to break into the field. I'm currently a CS undergrad who is trying to soak in everything Stats/DS-related that I can, and I've been enjoying it a lot. Definitely my favorite subject under the broad umbrella of CS and it is why I'm interested in grad school at all.

---

Some courses that I've taken related to DS:

- Introduction to Political Science Research Methods (went over the basic stats concepts like populations, sampling, observational/experimental studies, difference in differences research design, creating and interpreting a linear regression, how to do this all with R)

- Java/Hadoop (did this more for a CS requirement, but also because Hadoop and MapReduce intrigued me from a DS perspective even though they were a pain to use)

- Intro to the Challenges of Big Data (really only gave me a cursory overview of current hardware and enterprise database technologies and algorithms that are employed in data gathering/cleaning/processing)


Currently taking:

- Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Social Science (more of the same as the research methods course, but has more like a traditional statistics and is a degree requirement)

- Python for Data Science (pandas, scikit-learn, when to use different algorithms in scikit-learn/overviews of feature generation)

---


I plan on going heavier with the math and taking intermediate/advanced stats courses before I graduate. I also intend to take a year-long (split into two parts) graduate-level DS course.

The first half goes over:

- data collection  data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;
- data management  accessing data quickly and reliably;
- exploratory data analysis  generating hypotheses and building intuition; prediction or statistical learning;
- communication  summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

The second half goes over big data and database management, interactive visualizations, basic Bayesian methods, nonlinear statistical models, unsupervised learning, and deep learning.

---
I also have an internship with a professor where I've been contributing to his data analytics company, but it hasn't been super fruitful from a career or research perspective. It has kind of been a lot of branding consulting/copywriting work. I created a new website for them and contributed ideas on how to orient their (very abstract and not conventionally glamorous) analytics products to the public. I'm thinking that I should find a legitimate DS internship now that I have the formal experience working with a few different tools.

My current GPA is about a 3.4, but should go up to a ~3.55 if I end up with all A's this semester. Trying to work my way up to a 3.7 before graduating (~1.5 years left), but I'm unsure if I'll get there. I guess I just desire feedback about where my gaps are based on my current plan and what I should be prioritizing. Thank you.",1,0

* Build a public portfolio of data projects, I aim to complete about six, from open datasets, completed Kaggle competitions and other interesting sources, and publishing these projects as series on a blog I create.

I would appreciate any feedback on my idea, or alternatives that I might pursue instead. Other alternatives I am also considering:
- Competing heavily in Kaggle competitions, with the goal of improving my progression rank on Kaggle.
- Study more deep learning in depth and do MOOCs to improve gaps in my knowledge.",2,4

Context: I am 25 years old with a general BA and I've worked in advertising for the past 4 years. I use an incredible amount of data every day prepared by data scientists and I want to be the one who sets that up. My company has excellent online learning courses I have taken as introductory training and they will make it easy for me to transfer to another department once I feel ready to make the jump.


My question is what is the best way to take the next step?


1. Go for a MBA or MS? What field would work best? Stats? CS? something else?


2. Go for a second BA or a BS. Again, in what field is best?


3. Online certifications; maybe through Microsoft, or other big name companies?


4. Find a basic entry level position that will teach me on the job while I gain experience working in the field.


5. Simply learn it on my own (buy books, take select online course, learn through people I know in the field).



I'm dedicated and for the first time in my life passionate about the field and have total confidence that I can make this happen, just need to know what is actually the best way.

A classifier outputs a sequence of letters (26 possible classes in the alphabet). You need to present to management the ten most common classes.

Is this a ""type"" of problem? I'm not even sure what to google to explore how I should have answered this. Ideas I have include storing and updating the max of the top ten, min of the top ten, max of the bottom 16, Order of the top ten classes... etc but I'm falling short of a substantive answer.

I've basically no experience in this, so go easy on me if my questions seem stupidly obvious.

I am working on this project for a very old company where many (my bosses) are not exceptionally knowledgeable of stats, and methodologies have previously been nothing more advanced than graphs/OLS.

The data I am attempting to model the customer score of is compiled from two sets: one generated via phone interactions and one via web interactions, so there are similar features, but also mutually exclusive ones (leading to quite a bit of NAs). I don't think this is the correct procedure, and believe we should investigate the processes separately.  But.. this is my first actual career out of school, and technically I was hired for a reporting role but I've been able to wiggle my way into this project and am very much hoping this project will help facilitate my transition into a more statistical role, so I want to be sure I'm correct in my thought process.

My plan after sorting the data issues is to run some ordinal regression model(s) via logistic methods, in addition to some ordinal-specific random forest implementations in order to try and tease out the most useful features.

It focuses on the analysis of what Todays promotion can bring for apps and helps developers conclude the application process and requirements of Today. As the coming of iOS 11, great updates have happened on Apple App Store, including new interface style, internal algorithm and other functions. Among all the updates, the newly\-born Today gains more attention. What is Apple Today? How many stories have been published? How many apps have been promoted? Which app has been promoted mostly? Which developer wins the best? How about the promoting results? What happens on rankings after promotion?

Find image charts details here [https://www.appbi.com/us/index/online](https://www.appbi.com/us/index/online)

AppBi, an App Search Marketing pioneer, recently has released App Store Data Report on TODAY, aiming to bring more insights for iOS developers! Firstly lets have a glance at Apple Today: Today is derived from Feature of iOS 10 App Store. It displays 6 cards every day \(US\) with app stories in cards written by App Store editors, introducing many apps and games for iOS users. Generally, 6 cards will be displayed every day. There is no doubt that it is the best promoting way for iOS apps. Each card has theme, title, and story and downloads link, etc.  The report is based on the US Today data from 2017\-09\-09 to 2018\-02\-09 \(153 days\), including 918 stories and 2,403 apps.

Today Stories

1 Themes of Today  GAME OF THE DAY, APP OF THE DAY and THE DAILY LIST are the top 3 themes of Today. The three accounts for about 60&amp;#37; of all the themes. 1.2 Apps of Each Story  It always promotes only 1 app of each story; while some may promote several apps at the same time. Generally speaking, one story with one app will lead to better results. 1.3 Times of Apps  For each app, it does not has only one chance to be selected by Today. If an app is really excellent or suitable for many themes, it may be promoted many times. 1.4 Best Stories of Today  The story listed above is written by App Store Today editors. With a narrative tone, the story leads us to a fairy tale world with weird, half\-pipe and red snapper. It arouses users interests to find more funning things of the app. With the vivid story, this app has ranked higher than before and acquired numerous users.

Features of Today Apps 2.1 Categories  From the distribution of categories, it is concluded that Apple editors are more likely to select the apps of Games and Education. These kinds of apps have more opportunities. 2.2 Rating Stars  On the basis of AppBis analysis, rating star may be one of the standards of Apple editors. Higher rating stars generally mean higher quality of apps. 2.3 App Price  Apple sometimes may promote some paid apps so that it can also get benefits from them.

Top Apps ofToday 3.1 Apps Promoted Mostly 

Only parts of apps can be promoted many times. They are the lucky dogs among the millions of iOS apps. 3.2 Best Apps of Free of Top Charts 

For the Free of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1481. 3.3 Best Apps of Paid of Top Charts 

For the Paid of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1496. 3.4 Best Apps of Top Grossing of Top Charts 

For the Top Grossing of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1318. 4. Top Developers ofToday  

From the Top 10 list, we can find that, besides some qualified developers products, Apple will also promote its own apps. 5. Overview of Rank Changes 5.1 Changes after Promotion  From the top bar chart, we can know that for the three situations of top charts, most apps rank higher than before, some rank lower and some can reach the top 1 after promotion. 5.2 Changes within 7 Days  On the account of AppBis research, it is concluded that for any top charts, the average rank rising ranges will be smaller as time goes. 6. Surprising App  Splitter Critters  The app \[Splitter Critters\] has been promoted several times. And after each promotion, it ranks higher than before, even reaching top 10. One of the most rewarding things is that \[Splitter Critters\] has been selected by Apple as the Best App of 2017.  7. Disappointing App  Apps that have been promoted by Today more than once have no rises on ranking. 

Stickers and Health &amp; Fitness are the most disappointing categories. It means that Today has promoted apps of these categories; However, the apps have not been listed by App Store in any top charts. 8. Conclusion 8.1 Data Report This AppBi report onTodayis based on 918 Today stories and 2,403 apps. Among all the reporting details: The most frequent themes are: GAME OF THE DAY, APP OF THE DAY and THE DAILY LIST; One story may promote 1 app or 20 apps at the same time; The best story can lead to huge rising of the promoted app; Most apps are promoted by Today once only; The app \[Netflix\] has been promoted 16 times by Today; Games and Education apps are mostly promoted; The selected apps mainly have 4.5 rating stars; Large number of apps ranking rises after promotion; Some of them even reach Top 50 or Top 10;  The questions about Today may be solved. This is the story of Today and we can find many funny details or some surprising ones. AppBi hopes that the data and analysis can be useful for you. 8.2 Future Trends On the account of the AppBis findings, it seems that Today selects apps randomly; However, some common features of the selected apps may be picked. What are the common requirements of those promoted apps? AppBi guesses that in future, Today will take the following factors into consideration when selecting apps. High Quality Apps: An app with high quality interface and creative functions will have more opportunities to be promoted by Today. Also, a high quality app means it can meet users certain demands. User\-friendly Interface: As we know that both Apples hardware products and software ones tend to keep a simplest style, so simple designing style and user\-friendly interface will catch App Store editors eyes. Fluent Operating Process: If an app is operated not smoothly, it may lose plenty of users due to the bugs. Fluent operating process can be a basic requirement of a high quality app. Except for the above listed ones, some extra points may also be important. For example:  Firstly\-released apps or updated apps: according to AppBis analysis, those apps that are firstly\-released on App Store or updated for a new version have more opportunities to be selected.  Eye\-catching stories of apps: as we know that Today will introduce an app with words, images and videos sometimes, so an app with an eye\-catching story may make itself stand out. This report made by AppBi is aimed to help more developers get the knowledge of Today and learn more about its data. AppBi believes that Today will select and introduce more high quality apps in future. And users can find their favorite apps when reading stories.",0,0

It's at a company I love with a group of developers that are great but there are issues.  I'm the only Data Scientist and I don't get much direction.  I've been able to put machine learning models into production but a lot of time I have to focus on providing basic summary statistics.  The problems I deal with are common business questions.

I feel like I've gotten to a point where every time I finish a project I have a minor panic attack because I'm unsure of what to work on next.  I get stressed out and fear that I'm doing a bad job and it's only a matter of time until the company finds out it doesn't really need a Data Scientist.

I'd really like to stay at this company but am reluctant to plant roots (buy a house) since all Data Scientist jobs in the city seem to be similar 'company hears Data Scientists are cool so they hire one' types.  I'd hate to be in a position where I purchase a house in this city and my development in Data Science stagnates since I'm stuck taking similar positions that don't provide professional growth.

I'd ideally like to move to a city where there are big name tech companies with Data Science teams that I can learn from but this would delay home ownership.

My question comes down to

Am I correct in worrying about my professional development if I continue to work at companies where I'm the only Data Scientist or is this a common situation and am I overestimating the value of working at a company with a Data Science team?

On average I work ~30 hours a week.  

Have pension 

Health insurance mostly covered for

4 weeks of annual leave a year

Difficult to get fired (due to union)

I was wondering how much better is the compensation in the private sector?  Part of me want to just stay here since I am comfortable.  Part of me wants to improve myself with textbooks and edX in order to join the private sector.

My boss, who has a very basic understanding, but large interest in business intelligence wants me to explain to my department the various rolls and sequencing in a data driven environment/project/research. 

This all came out of a conversation where my boss was asking me for potential prescriptions based off a report I generated. I told her that's not necessarily my roll, and that should really go down the pike to maybe a group of individuals to discuss. This brought me to explaining the difference between data science, data analysis, business intelligence, formulating strategies off of data, and how these are all different aspects of looking at data and occur at different points in the process. She was excited to hear this because she knows others would like to be a part of decision making, strategy formulating, and some even analyzing the data, but they don't have the technical nor mathematical skillet that I have. 

Now she wants me to explain to my department and others in the college what these different spheres and rolls are in a data driven process and what the sequence is in this process. The truth is...I really don't know specifically. I feel like I am laying the groundwork for our process in moving forward with data driven research and decision making, but I only have a general idea of what that should look like.

Based on the following points, can you share your thoughts on which university should I finalize:

1. The program at UIUC is ""MS in Statistics with a concentration in Analytics"", offered by the Department of Statistics, and the Duke program is ""MS in interdisciplinary Data Science"", offered by Social Science Research Institute (SSRI) and Information Initiative at Duke (IID).

2. Curriculum wise, I like both the programs equally well. The only difference is that the Duke's program offers greater flexibility and includes a capstone project during second year of Masters.

3. The UIUC program is an established, old program. On the other hand, Duke's program would have it's inaugural class in Fall 2018.

4. Both the programs are 2 years long (UIUC gives option of completing it in 1.5 years as well). The total tuition fees for UIUC would be $55000, whereas at Duke it would be $94300.

5. The class size at Duke would be 30-35 students, compared to 60-70 students at UIUC.

297,2018-4-12,2018,4,12,2,8bj19f,Interviewing for a Data Mining Analyst role. Should I expect data science interview question questions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8bj19f/interviewing_for_a_data_mining_analyst_role/,isappleworthit,1523468801,"Hey everyone, Id appreciate the help. I recently graduated with my Masters in Data Analytics from a pretty underrated university. Prior to that I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics from the same university. Since December Ive been applying for job trying to at minimum get an interview for a data analyst position applying what I learned in the masters program. I was lucky enough to find a job with my bachelors degree upon graduation but Im mostly working in Excel (includes macros and power pivots), SAP, and Power BI. Im also not doing any predictive analytics, machine learning, or extensive analysis. 

After months of applying for jobs, I was lucky enough to get a call back for a HR Insights Analyst role within HR (I assume). I interviewed with the hiring manager over the phone and felt pretty good about the interview. After a two-week hiatus I was contacted from the company referring me for another position they felt I was a better fit for in their data science department.

Enter interview for Data Mining Analyst. 

I was sent the requirements for the role, which in my opinion seems vague and extremely broad. They also seemed geared towards an entry level position. 

**Here are the requirements:**

* Understand and implement data-driven applications and advanced analytical solutions that leverage predictive analytics, data
mining techniques, machine learning, open source tools, orchestration tools, Python, R, Spark etc.

* Leverage analytical experience to develop analytical solutions using appropriate tools and technology to solve complex
analytical problems.

* 4 year degree or equivalent experience and 2 to 4 years of relevant functional experience; BA/BS or MS in an analytic discipline preferred

* Ability to take complex business analyses and projects from concept to completion and make the results accessible and relevant to business users at all levels

* Self-starter and motivated with a strong attention to detail and commitment to meeting timelines and operating from a sense of urgency.

* Analytical experience with either Python, R, Spark, Java, Scala or another Big Data technology/platform.

* Understanding of analytical tools (e.g. APT, dunnhumby, Tableau, MicroStrategy, Alteryx, etc.)

Ive already interviewed with the hiring manager over the phone and next I am interviewing with the other analysts over the phone. From there I would be invited on-site to interview. Because I havent used Python or R since Ive graduated, I should probably sharpen those skills. I also thought it was interesting there was no mention of SQL, which is something I am comfortable with but would also need to brush up on. I did a short 6-week course in Tableau / Data Visualization and work in Power BI daily so I fully understand how to use prominent analytical tools.  

Im worried because the role seems pretty entry level I might be overlooking something because I am confident I meet the requirements of the role. Is there anything I should focus on? Are there any resources anyone recommends?

Do you set seeds only once? Or do you set seeds each time you run a command/function? If you set the seed multiple times, do you use the same seed or different ones? 

What I have been doing is using people's birthdays as seeds since I can remember them easily, e.g. 32689, and using them every time I do something that uses randomness. While I don't use the same seed back-to-back, I do cycle through four different seeds such that I may use the same seed two or three times on larger projects. ",7,2

Frankly though I'm more surprised at this outrage. Facebook has been a household name for over a decade. How are people still surprised about what seemed to me to be common knowledge about the service? I've always used Facebook with the understanding that my every move is being monitored by them to create a data file on me that they then use to sell targeted ads. I've always used it with the understanding that people's engagement with content directly impacts where and how far that content is spread. So when I see people on the right cry censorship over conservative posts not getting the same engagement rates as others, or when I see people on the left cry about Trump's campaign using Facebook the way it's designed to be used by marketers I'm left scratching my head. Earlier in this decade apps used Facebook to collect info on people. The few I remember using this way seemed clear to me that this was the case. I don't get this sudden concern when people have willingly given info to Facebook and these apps for years. This is all voluntary behavior from users.

""Facebook privacy concerns"" is a oxymoron to me. It's Facebook. It's by design not private. The reason I (and I presumed everybody else) use it is because it's not private. Because there is some information I want to share, that I don't want private. Information I want to be private I don't reveal to or on Facebook. Information I want to post anonymously I post on other platforms, not Facebook. Information I don't want tracked in any way I keep off the internet entirety. If others do not know how to adjust privacy settings on their phone (geotagging etc) or on Facebook itself, how is that Facebook or your phone's fault anymore then it's Kenmore's fault if you burn yourself because you are careless using their stove or don't understand how it works?

I've also used Facebook with the understanding that they use cookies and other technology to monitor my use on other sites related to my Facebook use. Again, all of this I assumed was common knowledge and in the terms that all users have to agree to in order to use the service. Perhaps it's me who is jumping to conclusions. Is this not all laid out in the terms?

I've seen a lot of scorn at Facebook and Mark and I don't understand how it's justified. I've also seen a lot of speculation, like Facebook secretly activates the mic on people's phones to spy on them, and maybe this is true, but without anything resembling proof at this point that seems more like a conspiracy theory to me.

So my question is how is all this ill will at Facebook justified? I mean, we all have our complaints about the service, me too, but that doesn't mean they did anything wrong if you or I don't like the design or their business model. 

I'm not sure where the best place to ask this question is. I want answers from people who actually know what they're talking about, not speculation or unsubstantiated claims from those that don't. I'm guessing datascience might be an appropriate place, so here goes. If not sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; TLDR &gt;&gt;&gt;

What, if anything, has Facebook done that is illegal? And what if anything has Facebook done that while not illegal, maybe should be because it's generally unfair to users?

Please source all responses. I'm not interested in speculation or unsupported allegations. I'm only interested in confirmed examples of wrongdoing and general unfairness. ",15,16

I would love some critical (yet kind :D) feedback on what I need to do to further my career towards Data Science. 


-----------------------
Present Day:
At the moment I am being let go from a start-up in SF where I was a growth and marketing analyst. The reason for my boot is a lack of meticulous work when reviewing SQL pulls (never used SQL before this job so I expected some mistakes). I understand my downfall, and consider it a step in the right direction. 



-----------------------
Background: 
I'm almost 2 years of out college, with a degree in Quantitative Methods and Modeling (very little programming involved). I have taught myself Python, R, and now SQL over the past year. My knowledge is mostly theoretical so it gets hard to apply my knowledge to the fast-pace professional world.  E.g. I created a Time Series Forecast in about a week and a half, but I feel like my mind is attempting to learn programming, relearn stats meanings, and the business problem all at once. So I'm REALLY slow. 


Question 1: Is it normal in the professional world to be this bogged down?

 
Question 2: Are there conceptual steps/tricks people have learned to break everything down? 


----------------------
Future:
My ideas for the future are 

1. Find another job that is large and will not be so fast-paced (and pray to god I get a manager that enjoys mentoring lol)


2. Find an internship and attempt to create a better foundation for myself.


2. Go to a Data Science Boot Camp


4. Go back for a MBA PhD


Question 3: Is there hope in just finding another job? If so, what kinda of jobs should I be looking for?


Question 4: What are some good Boot Camps for DS?


Question 5: Is it true that some graduate programs do not need GREs to apply if you are in the industry for +2 years?


Question 6: Any other thoughts?",1,3

I had always planned to major in CS as I enjoy programming and building apps, games, etc., but unfortunately I was not admitted to the CS major for the college I plan to attend (UCSD). However, I did get admitted to my second choice, Data Science, which admittedly I don't know much about. The major is brand new for UCSD so there's not much information on it within the school setting. I'm getting conflicting advice- some people are telling me it's going to become the ""future"" and all that, others are telling me to choose another college in which I was admitted to CS (which I really can't do for financial reasons). It seems that CS is the more popular, ""recommended"" route; is there any reason for one to find more benefits pursuing Data Science? As far as finding a job/internship goes, would a bachelor's be essentially the same value of a masters? Any advice or important info to know about the field? I'm just trying to get a feel for what's coming ahead when I start college. ",2,1

Some of you probably recognize my username. I've taken all of your advice to heart as much as possible, I've hired a really good professional resume writer, and I'm trying to learn Amazon Web Services on my own. 

A few people commented in my past thread that if I can't learn how to put a machine learning model into production, I'm probably not cut out for the field. I don't understand this. I've had to be self-sufficient throughout my online grad-level statistics program (and this is not watered down; I'm taking the same classes as Ph.Ds do at a top stats university), I know what it takes to truly master something on my own, but I'm clearly not getting this. Documentation for my particular situation with all of the Google searching I've done seems to be extremely sparse, and I'm not at all sure why. Are people just born as geniuses or something in this field? 

&lt;/rant&gt;

**For the problem I'm trying to solve, here's all you really need to know:**

1) I have a 7GB .csv file. My RAM can't handle this size of a file. I'm using a Windows computer. I am starting to see that if I want to do this in the long term, I will need to learn Linux (or Ubuntu, or whatever there is out there).

2) My primary tool is R. I like Python for things like numpy and scipy, but I don't know anything about pandas, hence I'd rather stick with R.

3) My goal is this: **I need to be able to load the data set and train a model using keras in R**.

**My attempts**:

1) Created a MySQL database using HeidiSQL. Uploaded the .csv file into a table. Great for storage, can't do anything with it for data manipulation. If you were to try querying these data, R would crash.

2) Got an AWS account. Uploaded the file to S3. Followed a bunch of directions for trying to get this data to DataBricks as a table. ""Internal server error"" DataBricks tells me, can't find any documentation on this, am incredibly frustrated.

3) Thought about getting RStudio Server for AWS. But I wouldn't even know where to begin with trying to load the file from the AWS bucket if I couldn't even get it to work for DataBricks.

As simple as the above may seem, I've spent at least 20 hours trying and thinking about the above, and I'm clearly not getting it.

Can anyone point me to something that will actually work and has some decent documentation? I don't know anyone whom I can consult on this topic.",19,14

I call the sample rich, because the sample should not represent the big sample in a way a random sample would, it should rather represent all possible variables that are in the big sample.

My plan on doing so is to define a metric for categorical and a metric  for numerical variables. I then pick a random sample, for which i find (based on my predefined metric) the point which is furthest away from my sample.

I tried to implement it in python but as it turned out to be incredibly slow. The sample consists out of 80 000 points, where each points is in a 50-dimensional space.

I am trying to understand and hopefully build a database of keywords from amazon. 
Like when user type in some words like ""wallet"" , Amazon suggest the user more phrases based on what user type.

There are companies who are doing it. I just don't understand how they do it.

My guess is that they scrape Amazon suggestions and store in DB. But I don't know how to approach that as well. Because there are so many categories and different kinds of products and finding keywords for each of them would be so much costly error prone etc..

With that database this companies build services like reverse ASIN..basically based on the product their service extract keywords that product uses or ranks for on Amazon.

I only have the option to get into the MS in Data Informatics or MS in Computer Science. If I want to take MS in CS with Data Science, I would have to spend 1 more year which I think is not worth it.

I have searched around this sub, but most of the posts are talking about MS in Data Science, not Data Informatics.

I don't know if having the degree say ""Informatics"" as opposed to ""Science"" would make a difference to future employers.

In the future, I have no intention of getting a PhD. My goal is to be as marketable as possible in the data field. However, I want to avoid closing too many doors in the software engineering field so I have a fallback plan if I'm unable to compete with people who have a PhD.

Both curriculum looks appealing to me, so I have no preference in either. However, if the MS in Data Informatics is not as marketable, then I would go with the MS in Computer Science.

I've automated these reports(still in excel, it's an incremental process to transition these projects) and I am in the process of getting the data out of excel, starting to write code in R to clean the data and make reports.

I generally feel like I am KILLING IT at my job. I'm really proud of the progress I've made and, if there are errors, at least they are systematic errors that are easy to identify and fix.

However, I get really stressed out when I do make a mistake. For example, I sent out some reports this afternoon, after they'd been reviewed by my boss, and I then realized I'd made an error in the data cleaning process and I had to re-run one of the reports.

When other people make mistakes, I am very understanding, and I try to apply that to myself, but it's really hard.

MY Director and CMO are incredibly impressed with my work, but I have this nagging feeling like I am not performing/learning enough. I have a ton of experience in the company, but I feel I am drowning in projects.

Maybe this is because I have been doing massive project after massive project, but I feel like I am drowning. I am pretty sure my backlog is already till Q4 2018, Q1 2019. 

Supporting a 300 person company is exhausting with only 2 people, and my director really is more guiding our analytics vision versus working on projects. 

The brightside is I work directly with C-Level executives and have been gaining a lot of insights on what companies need at a higher level.

I could also use such a service to identify parameters of my personality that a potential mate will or will not like, and priortize my interests and personality quirks based on that (if I felt inclined). Like if I *really* wanted to attract X girl, I have to start being really interested in A, B, and C. If it turns out that I really hate A, B and C, then I know that I should probably pursue a different girl. 


Id really like to try this out and actually called a couple firms but havent gotten a call back haha",8,1

Unsure if it's the right path to advance my career. Seeking out some advice from those with more experience than I about the value of an MS in DS.

**Background:**

BEng in Electrical Engineering in 2016 and have since been hopping around jobs. I've decided that I wanted to orient my career towards data science, and specifically analyzing large data sets of 'alternative' data to provide insights and make predictions about people and trends in society (vague I know, but anywhere between investment analysis to experimental economics to market research to data-driven product development to policy analysis).

I've been self-taught thus far, and have learned Python to an intermediate-advanced level, but not near the level that I would aspire to be at. Currently, I'm a DS intern at a big-ish company that uses data science to improve operational performance of machines and plants. However, there's no guarantee of it turning into a full-time job. And to be fully honest, despite it being a fascinating field that I continue to learn from, it isn't one that I see myself working in later on.

**Situation:**

The Uni started offering this accelerated professional Masters program only two years ago. The program itself is a year long and offers courses in Math &amp; Stats, CS, ML, Visualization amongst other subjects and concludes in a Capstone project that is industry-related.

On the downside, 

* Significantly more expensive than the normal two-year MS/MA degrees (CAD 30K/year vs CAD 5K/year), so I'd probably need to take a loan and work part-time to pay for it.
* It is non-research based and the accelerated nature of the program probably wouldn't allow me to become a research/teaching assistant to subsidize some of the funds.
* Being such a new program, I haven't been able to assess the outcome for the students who have graduated from it.

On the plus side, 

* Still an advanced degree, will be a significant boost to my knowledge and the CV
* Only 1 year, so will allow me to get into the workforce relatively quickly
* An opportunity to work with other aspiring Data Scientists and potentially collaborate on some interesting projects
* Being a more general degree, it'll help me to transition into 'Social Data Science' easier than an engineering degree for example.

**Question(s):**

So my question is, what is your take on these kinds of professional programs? Are they worth the money? I've read that some people think that these programs are cash grabs by universities trying to ride the wave of the latest fad. Would someone be better off getting a MS in CompSci or Stats or Math or even an MA in Econ, and then using that advanced degree to transition into DS?

I've also noticed that more recently there has been a slight sway in opinion, and people saying that an advanced degree in DS provides the necessary fundamentals from each of the constituent disciplines (Math, Stats, CS, Visualization, and Communication) and some good practical work that could lay the foundation for a career in DS. Has anyone experienced this to be the case?

Or would I be better off holding out for a FT job with my current company and then use that experience to bounce up the chain rather than spend funds on a Masters degree at all?

It's a classic experience vs. education debate and, if education, then which path. And it's been messing with my head for a few days now so any and all answers/suggestions are welcome and greatly appreciated.

**Disclaimer:**

I'm well aware that to get to the level where I will be doing anything substantial at big companies or government and earn the salaries being thrown around will take years and significant work experience. I'm in it for the long haul.

I know there are similar posts to this one that have been posted before. I've probably read through each and every one of them and their comments over the last 48 hours. This post is about my particular situation, and I would like to hear opinions from those currently working and have experience in the field of data science and those who have pursued a MS/MA in DS or a related field and ended up in DS.",9,0

Basically,  our company sells 65 products.  We sell to business's.  But, our business's are viewed as multiple customers.  Think subway. We dont sell to corporate subway, but to the individual subway stores.


**Current Proccess**
What the data scientist was doing was creating a similarity score.  using the following logic:

1. Create count of products purchased by each individual substore

2.  compare counts of products across substores under a corporate entity

3. look at the mean of products compared to standard deviation

4. Similarity Score = 1-(STD/MEAN)


**Issue**

This method doesnt even look at if they are buying the same products. so its not truly showing how similar they are

**Question**

I've read some things about product recommendation engines and how some algorythyms use user similarity rankings to do so.  Can this be done here?

The issue is that would only compare two individual subway stores , not create an overall index for subway as a whole. so i can then compare their purchasing behavior similairty to another company.

For example, do all subway stores buy the same products from us? Whereas Quiznoes stores buy a more random assortment?

I have been at the same company and while I enjoy the work that I am doing (developing tools/scripts in python, perl, vba, and bash), I feel like the culture and industry where I work is not really 'tech-focused' so I don't feel like I am a good fit. 

I have looked into changing companies into a more tech-oriented position, however competing salaries are usually for senior engineer and manager positions, the first which I do not feel qualified for and the second which I have no interest in.

One option I have is to take a lower paying position at another company and start over, hopefully learning new skills while I am on the job to transition up. I want to get out of the energy/SCADA industry altogether so I wanted to ask if anyone here has been in a similar situation (working an IT job in a non-IT field) and if so, what did you do in order to make the transition?

The idea of going back to school to get a professional degree, such as the one offered by UCB seems like a safe way to ensure I am able to transition, however the price tag of ~60k seems quite high.

Getting another job without having to go back to school would be ideal, and I would rather avoid the pay cut if possible, but I'm starting to feel like I have no other option (school or lower position) if I want to change jobs to another industry.",8,0

* If you could get in anywhere, which university would you apply to ? Why? 
* What is better : Working in the industry in the U.S/Canada or somewhere thats just starting out overseas? 
* What are some software you've used that no one prepared you for? (Obviously, not talking about R / Python / etc)

Ive been accepted to a Data Science Masters in France, and Im terribly scared about going because Im not confident in my own abilities.

1. Download the Wikipedia dump, pick 400k articles, clean them up, slice them into a collection containing 2-3 sentences each.
2. Train a model using unsupervised, competitive learning (Self-organising map, on a 2d plane), to cluster sentences with similar words closer together, and sentences with dissimilar words further apart. ([As he says in the lecture video](https://youtu.be/iZlUj6TKl70?t=1134))

Some background on my situation. I'm currently in a MD/MS Biomedical Engineering program and have finished 2/4 years of my MD and will finish my masters in a couple of months. 

I've basically hijacked my masters into taking a bunch of computer science grad courses (machine learning, database, artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms, signal processing, control systems, etc.). Now, I realized that my interests lie more in data science, but a bit too late to take more classes towards that goal.

Now I'm at a point where I've gained some useful skills (R, SQL, python, TF), and applied what I've learned in a couple of self-directed projects and Kaggle competitions. I've worked with some public clinical datasets (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) and some imaging datasets, but I don't have any real working/industry experience.

1) The temptation right now is to just drop out of my MD, take my masters, and apply for some entry level data jobs with the hopes of cracking the health data industry. My fear is that my resume/portfolio isn't strong enough yet and I've been considering getting another masters to plug in some of knowledge gaps.

2) I can finish my MD, be more in debt, and reevaluate before residency.

I've looked into programs like Insight and the likes, but unfortunately I'm not able to move right now and they don't offer the program where I attend school.

My question to you all is:

The work that you did as a masters or phd researcher far outweighs the intellectual challenges of what you face as a data scientist. For example, if you were a theoretical physicist, the math that you had to know and the semantic density and difficulty of papers you had to read and publish is at least 50 times harder than knowing, for example, how to use keras or tensorflow, or how to pull data from a mysql server using a python library. As a data scientist, you also deal with data quality, governance, etc. that is really different from the pure science work that you did as a student.

Do you still enjoy data sciency work when you know that phd holders in machine learning get paid as much as you or even more than you while doing far more intellectually challenging work than what you do as a data scientist?

I'll be doing a lot of things related to Business Intellgence included dashboards, ad-hocs, etc. But will also be able to get my hands on some machine learning projects to help with their clientele. Even those it's a legal firm this specific branch of the company is dedicated to the tech side of things. In that aspect they are a little bit more advanced than I expected.

The second offer is for a huge media corporation, where I would be a Senior Analyst. In this role I'll be doing less BI(dashboarding) and more data analytics with the specific group I'll be part of. I would say a lot more on the statistics/econometrics side of the house with some Machine Learning thrown in there as well. I'd be under the Director of Analytics for this department. I'd say their tech department is a lot more well defined so I would definitely grow in terms of learning best practices and things of that nature in that environment. Also being at a company this large gives more credibility and visibility throughout the industry I believe. 

Both offers are around the same amount, but company 2 has tuition assistance (I'm doing a Masters Online in Statistics). Both roles will be heavy on SQL, Python. Role 1 will be more heavy towards Tableau visualizations as well. While role 2 will have me using Big Data tools like Hadoop and Sparkl.

Pros - Company 1
- Smaller
- I'd say more room to explore and learn as I go in DS
-Will in some capacity have the opportunity to do DS work.
Cons Company 1
- Somewhat less defined credibility in the ""Tech"" sphere
- I won't have ""SR"" in my position title
- Lack of Tuition Assistance

Pros - Company 2
- Reputable in the tech sphere
- Tuition Assistance
- Defined hierarchy and tasks will lend itself to me learning best practice. 

Cons
- Larger Company
-Stricter in exploration and trial by fire

3. [Simon Fraser University MS Big Data, Canada] (https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/graduate-students/academic-programs/bigdata/about.html)

I am currently an international student in the US and immigration is sort of a big deal for me. Canada is significantly easier to immigrate to once you have a Canadian degree and the SFU program is also significantly cheaper (almost half the price of Rutgers or UPenn).

I'm really confused about which program to choose. The Rutgers and SFU programs have the advantage of a practical work component built into the program but UPenn is just a better school overall. 

Canada is easier to immigrate to but does not have as many job opportunities as the US.

for the purpose of my bachelor thesis, I'm trying to recreate a machine learning part of well-known paper published by Frey and Osborne called: **""The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?""**. I've already manged to get some resuts, but at the same time I have a lot of second thoughts and issues, with which I think you can help me. These are the most important:

1. They've hand-labeled 70 observations, which accounts for 10% of all rows, which is understandable since the data source wasn't designed to measure automation impact. **Then, they train their models on those data and test every model 100 times on samples from training data (50% of labeled observations)**. My question is: is that a proper approach and if not, what would be better ? Maybe it's better to use 50% of labeled observation (it's relatively small number, like 30) and test it on those which has left. Using authors approach with logistic regression my classifier's AUC is on average equal to 0.94.

2. Another thing that worries me is **correlation matrix, with most values close to or higher than 0.5**. Clearly it suggests a relationship between the variables. Does this not interfere with the use of the probabilistic classification model (gaussian process classifier) used by the authors ?

3. Also, what bothers me is the fact that as far as logistic regression is concerned, **only two variables are statisticly important**.

Thank you for your time

I would just like to confirm if what I heard is true and if anyone could provide further insights.

Besides the roles which are essentially the same as data analysts or data engineers, my friend, who is a data scientist, told me there are two types: application data scientists and research data scientists.

He says the application type DS does modeling to solve a business need and only uses tools which are already developed. There are not a whole lot of models \(he uses xgboost, random forests, neural nets, glm, etc.\) to choose from/play around with besides just tuning parameters. He says it gets boring fast and already learned pretty much all he can within 2 years.

He says the research DS are the ones who do the most interesting cutting\-edge work \(e.g. nlp, ai, voice recognition, self\-driving cars, deep learning\) and creating new algorithms. This is the interesting and high paying DS work that most people want.

He also claims the following increasing order of pay, interesting work, and difficulty:

Application DS \&lt; Software Engineer \&lt; Research DS.

My impression was that the application DS is what most data scientists are and it is interesting, creative work. The research DS job is ML/DL/AI research, requires a phd, and are more like researchers than actual data scientists.

Could anyone verify how much of what he says is true?

Does application DS really get boring after awhile?

Is the pay comparison among the 3 jobs correct on average?

Is there really such a divide in DS and if so, is it difficult to switch from applications to research w/o phd after a few years of experience?",22,36

**Method A: Basic imputation logic**
I could just use basic imputation logic:

1. If i have used cars sales reported by dealer use that

2. If not, If i  have online listed by dealer use that

3. if not, if i have group used car sales avg, use that.

4. if not, if i have segment used car sales avg, use that.

**MethodB: Impute using regression/machine learning**

Or i could do imputation based using MICE or a regression.

What i was thinking of is 

1.running each Dealer segment in its own model since they should have more or less similar sales

2. run Mice using Used Car sales, Online Sales, Group sales, Segment Sales

I dont have many other demographic variables about the customers, so it limits what i can put in their anyways.

so, is which of the two methods i suggest works better? if you have a better option, love to hear it

I'm working on a problem for classifying **3** gestures using the EMG signals obtained from muscles. 

* Each of the gestures has **6** trials of around **6-7s** duration.

* Each trial is divided into multiple segments of some window length like(150ms with overlapping). The trials are performed by **10** individuals .

* I've extracted **5** features from each segment.

* Each classes/gestures may not have exactly equal number of observations/examples but it would be around 3600.

*This is the background to check if all the assumptions for kw hold or not. I have the feature matrix as X (11000,5) and labels y(11000,1).*

Now I would like to test statistically if each of the 5 features has the ability to discriminate 3 gestures.
Hence for each feature, my understanding is, to use KW test to check that if features coming from 3 gestures are significantly different, i.e. if p-value&lt;0.05 then the features may be able to differentiate the gestures.
I coded in MATLAB for the first feature, like this:

    [p,tbl,stats]=kruskalwallis(X(:,1),y)

My background in statistics is pretty weak, and this is what I've understood so far from reading different articles regarding kw test.

* I would like to know, if my way of thinking for the statistical test to show the discrimination ability of features is correct or not.

* secondly, is the code correct? I have found p=0 for each of the features I've tried. so I'm wondering if there's something wrong.

I'm a non-native speaker so please ignore my grammatical mistakes.
Thank you very much for your valuable feedback.

I'm trying to learn some DS, so I'm getting into it now.

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) to start. It's not great, to be honest; the guy is promoting his book, makes a ton of conceptual errors (like enumerating a non-ordinal categorical feature (for example, ""Embarked""), and then treating it like an ordinal feature, which is just dead wrong unless I'm missing something), but I actually got some beginner info from it.

I made my own little notebook to get into it. What I ended up doing was basically just doing a preliminary visualization of the data. I looked plotted the survival rate of each of the features, by the value. This let me see a few clear trends, so then I just chose the Sex and Fare features, and tried a few models on that, to begin. I just chose Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, from scikit-learn. I split the ""train"" data file (that is, the one with both features *and* labels) into a 70/30 random mix. Here's what I got with that super naive strategy:

    Log reg:
    Train score: 77.65
    Test score: 77.9
    
    Dec Tree:
    Train score: 92.12
    Test score: 80.9
    
    Rand Forest:
    Train score: 92.12
    Test score: 79.78

So about 80% test score for each. The latter two seem to overfit a bit. So at this point I was looking at what to try to improve. I have a few other things I could try, like some feature engineering (for example, creating Age bands, because it seems like aside from the *very* young, middle aged people survived the most).

But I looked at some other guides, and it seems like the common strategy is to use ensemble stacking. However, it seems like they basically end up with... not a whole lot higher than 80%. And I did the *bare minimum*.

Even [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy), which seems pretty thorough, has people complaining about getting a 79% accuracy on the Kaggle training set (unless I misread it?).

Is there something I'm missing, some detail? I mean, I want to believe that people can do awesome stuff and eke out some crazy accuracy, but the Titanic was a chaotic mess and there's a pretty good chance your survival really was determined by a couple messy factors, right?",3,2

I imagine real modelling would be more programming or stats focused than my math class was.

I also skimmed through a coursera course called statistical modelling or something or other but it was just: heres how you fit a regression line to some data points. So it was lacking, to say the least.

I want to learn how to do this from the ground up. ie. Heres some messy data, clean it, transform it, apply models to it (whatever that means), etc. Even if that means going back to school again, I just want to know what classes/program I should take learn this stuff.

Then it becomes necessary to revise the target to ensure that the team chasing has a fair target and the game produces a result due to play on the field. In other words, given a particular game and its current state, if it is interrupted, what should be the ideal target that should be set accounting for the loss of time due to the natural cause(s) so that the game can have a decisive result and at the same time provide the team chasing a fair chance to play. Currently Duckworth-Lewis (DL ) method is popularly used to revise the target of the game in case of interruptions.  
 Though the Duckworth/Lewis method works a lot better than the Rain rule, which was used prior to it, it is not perfect. I wanted to try ML algorithms to solve this problem, by incorporating more features instead of the two variables(overs and wickets) the DL method uses.

**Operational questions Data Analytics Interview Questions** 


Describe the steps you follow when designing a data-driven model to tackle a business problem. An example might be to automatically classify customer support emails by topic or sentiment. Another might be to predict a companys employee churn. 

Describe different pre-processing steps that you might carry out on data before using them to train a model and state under what conditions they might be applied. 

What models would you characterize as simple models and which ones as complex? 

What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of choosing a more complex model over a simpler one? 

In what ways can models be combined to form model ensembles and what are some advantages of doing this? 

What is dimensionality reduction? What are some ways to perform this? When and why might we want to do this? 


**Role-specific questions (Basic ideas in statistics, probability and machine learning)** 


What is a confidence interval and why is it useful?

 What is the difference between statistical independence and correlation? 

What is conditional probability? 

What is Bayes Theorem? Why is it useful in practice? 

Suppose we are training a model using a particular optimization procedure such as stochastic gradient descent. How do we know if we are converging to a solution? 

If a training procedure converges will it always result in the best possible solution? How do we know if we have collected enough data to train a model? Explain why we have training, test and validation data sets and how they are used effectively? 

What is clustering? Give an example algorithm that performs clustering. How can we know whether we obtained decent clusters? How might we estimate a good number of clusters to use with our data? 

We often say that correlation does not imply causation. What does this mean? What is the difference between unsupervised and supervised learning? 

What is the difference between regression and classification? What do we mean when we talk about the bias-variance tradeoff in statistical models? What is over-fitting? How is this related to the bias-variance trade-off? 

What is regularization? Give some examples of regularization in models. 

Suppose we want to train a binary classifier and one class is very rare. Give an example of such a problem. How should we train this model? 

What metrics should we use to measure performance? How many unique subsets of n different objects can we make?

How would you build a data-driven recommender system? What are the limitations of this approach? 


**(Tools, visualization and presentation)** 


In which environment(s) do you usually run your analyses? 

Describe your experience in working with data from databases. 

Are you familiar with SQL? 

What visualization tools (Tableau, D3.js, R and so on) have you used? 

Do you have a presentation you can show us, such as on SlideShare?

Do you have experience presenting reports and findings directly to senior management in your previous roles? Are you confortable speaking in public? Have you ever presented a technical topic to a large audience?

Me personally, I work on long-ish term projects set by the business. An example is building a system to predict whether or not a former customer is likely to deal with us again. These projects typically last around 3-6 months.

I spend around 25% of that time researching techniques, exploring and playing around with data, mostly in jupyter notebooks, to develop initial ideas and avenues for further inquiry. I spend about another 25% of my time on building a data pipeline (data ingestion, transformation, feature engineering) to get the raw data from it source into a form where it can be consumed by a machine learning algorithm. Another quarter of my time is spent on actually training models, iteratively improving them, trying out different algorithms and assessing their performance. The remaining 25% of my time is spent productionising the final model, which often involves collaborating with software engineers to integrate it into the company's wider ecosystem, perhaps by deploying it as a web API running in a container. In addition to all that, I also occasionally do a bit of straight up data analysis for key nontechnical stakeholders, explaining what a model is doing, translating ML/stats metrics into business metrics, often with visualisations and plots.

I work in python and always try and start out with the simplest possible models/ideas that could work and add in complexity from there if necessary. However, 90% of the time, the simple solution is all the business needs, as we are delivering a solution where none existed before, so the value added is huge. I know it's a DS clich but I've got a hell of a lot of mileage just out of *from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier*

All in all I'd say my job is around 50% software engineering, 40% machine learning, and about 10% statistics. It would be interesting to hear what those proportions look like in other DS jobs as I imagine they vary quite a bit.",17,22

a couple questions:

what is the likelihood of finding an employer who is willing to reimburse tuition/pay me to go to grad school while I work for them?

if I start work right after undergrad(before getting my masters) will the second degree in mathematics help land data science/quantitative analyst positions?

Should I spend my time (and money) getting a masters or teaching myself via online courses?  What timeline should I follow to make a career in DS, or is the grass not greener over here?**

I'm in my upper 20s and have BSs in applied math, physics, and astronomy.  I decided at the last minute to not pursue a PhD in physics, so I scrambled for a job, passed an actuarial exam, and got hired as an actuary.  While I don't dislike the job, I've never been very passionate about it, and I've never felt like I belong in the field--it has just been comfortable, well-paying, and with a clear path to follow.  What has begun to bother me is that my skills and knowledge are so specialized to insurance that I'd be stuck in that field if I continued down that path.  Spending thousands of hours studying for more exams to learn more about a unique field that doesn't particularly interest me is a loathsome thought, especially since the exam material isn't even used much as an actuary.  I want to develop myself as an employee with skills that are applicable for different projects/companies/fields.  The most variety I'd get as an actuary is choosing whether I want to work in health or auto insurance.

I've recently been exposed to data science through friends.  It sounds like something I'd be very interested and capable in (with time).  Unlike the path of an actuary, data science seems to be more about the journey than the destination.  Data scientists are constantly learning new skills, both in work and outside, and using those skills to build new tools and processes, leveraging those to launch themselves into more interesting projects and positions, and making themselves adept at using data to answer varied questions across different fields.  An actuary is like a garlic press--very good at doing one thing, but not useful for much else.  I'd rather be a well-honed knife.

I'm still working out the feasibility of trying to make a career change, but the fact that I can't stand to look at another actuarial textbook and want to spend my free time learning programming languages and taking machine learning courses is a sign I'm probably in the wrong field.  Here are my biggest questions, assuming I want to make the switch:

* Is my time better spent going back and getting a masters degree or teaching myself skills that would make me useful?
* If I should teach myself, what skills should I acquire?  I am great at Excel and have basic knowledge (editing others' code, not writing my own) of VBA and SAS, but I don't know other languages.  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/713hnw/how_i_went_from_no_coding_or_machine_learning/) suggests taking a bunch of Python courses, then Andrew Ng's machine learning, statistical learning, etc.
* How and when should I make the jump?  Do I keep working as an actuary until I am proficient in X, Y, and Z and then apply for jobs, or do I start applying for entry level data analyst positions that, while likely paying less than I make now, would be more conducive toward a career in data science?  What level or type of positions should I be looking for given my background?
* Am I crazy for wanting to get out of actuarial science?  Is the grass not greener in data science?
* Does anybody have an useful anecdotes from having gone through something similar?

Thanks in advance for the help, and I apologize for rambling a bit.  Typing this all out has been helpful for me trying to articulate what I feel like my career is lacking and what I am looking for instead.",1,0

I decided in 2017 I wanted to transition careers into data science so I taught myself what I thought I needed to know. Apparently I've done a decent job because I've made it to the final round of interviews at several companies (although no job yet).

Anyways, I've got a big interview this Friday and could use some advice. My problem is that all my data science experience has been on my personal machine. I've set up projects to show off with Jupyter notebooks but have no experience designing and implementing a project in production on the job. 

So does anyone have any good resources or advice to learn about best practices for topics such as:  

* Planning/defining a data science problem
* Determining company resources/data needed
* Best practices for designing a model that will be used in production/updated
* How to implement model into production (API?)
* Monitoring project performance to demonstrate impact
* Updating the model as new data comes in
* Communicating results/dealing with clients


Obviously I'll go Google ""best practices for data science project planning and management"" but posting on Reddit has gotten me some great resources and advice before. If this belongs in the weekly thread let me know and I'll take it down. I'm just new around here and wasn't sure about posting in a weekly thread that's 6 days old. ",1,1

First of all thank you for taking your time to read this. I will try to be clear and concise about my problem.

I am studying a Master in Data Science and I have the chance to do a placement in industry for the summer, where I will do my Master's thesis. I wanted to know your opinion about the project that I have been offered, and if you think it is a good choice for my future development as a Data Science. It has the following characteristics:


* Three-month internship in big investment company, present in more than 50 locations. Good reputation according to Glassdoor
* Objective: improvement of an existing Machine Learning algorithm that tries to explain how investment market behaves
* Programming in Matlab
* Skills developed are ML, statistics, finance and investment knowledge
* The work will be individual but I will have the support of a team of DS

-
The final decision will be mine (of course) but I just wanted to know your opinion about it. I don't know very much about investment, but I find it an interesting field that I always wanted to learn. Neither I am interested in any particular field, basically anything related with ML would be interesting for me.

-
The thing that doesn't totally convince me is programming in Matlab. I have experience on it, that is no problem, but I'm not sure it is being used in other industries like Python or R and if it will make it more difficult for me if I want to search for a job later on.

-
Could a project in Python always be more beneficial?

Due to company politics, the title of ""data scientist"" probably won't be approved. But related terms like machine learning, analytics, data analyst, etc are on the table. 

A little about my past experience:
Worked at the same company for more than five years straight out of college. I have a b.s. in a field related to the business, one year of graduate school courses in the same field (did not graduate, quit due to money) and a master's degree in data science from a local university. My previous job titles are data analyst, senior data analyst, and product manager. The data analyst roles consisted of reporting, data analysis to make business decisions, tons of SQL and building dashboards. The product manager consisted of managing the development of an internal product. This meant working with the devs to prioritize and explain the business requirements, while also being the ""data guy"" to support the business for all things related to the product. Also Performing data analysis to determine which product features should be prioritized. 

Description of current role: 
This will be a little vague to not give away the company I'm employed with. Current role main objective is to implement machine learning algorithms into production to better our product. I am the leader of a team of data analysts that will build models and pass on to IT to implement. One model is already built and driving business value, but is not in true production (it's a pickled python model I've set up to run hourly via flask). I will work with a true IT Dev to get it into an IT supported prod environment and then move on to tackling other problems using machine learning. I serve as the lead analyst to build models but also am the product owner in that I communicate the findings/benefits of the models to the business.

List of Skills/tools used or soon to be used  in current role:
SQL,
Python,
R,
AWS,
Neo4j,
Dashboard software (tableu, etc),
Potentially will use Spark at some point 


Tldr: Need job title other than data scientist for dual role of data modeling and product owner.",8,4

So my choice now is to choose my own courses or continue the program that I am studying now. Here are the courses for both of the education paths:

**My plan:**

* Ordinary Differential equations
* Algebra I
* Scientific Computing I
* Algebra II
* Datastructures and algorithms
* Real analysis
* Complex analysis
* Discrete mathematics
* Algebraic structures
* Topology
* Graph theory 
* Linear Programming
* Probability theory
* Stochastic differential equations
* Statistical modelling
* Stochastic processes and simulations
* Multivariate dataanalysis
* Big data


**What I would have studied on the Physics program:**

* Mechanics
* Physical models mathematics
* Wave physics and optics
* Electromagnetism
* Quantum Physics
* Analytical Mechanics
* ""Work integrated learning for engineers""
* Quantum Mechanics I
* Thermodynamics
* Electrodynamics
* Measuring techniques
* Scientific Computing 1 &amp; 2
* Statistical Physics
* Solid state physics



Do you think I am making the correct choice studying more math &amp; stats, or should I continue the physics program? Also I would highly appreciate specific course advice, for example if a course in Topology is completely irrelevant and employers wouldn't care about it.

I am currently working alone on a project at work and have some questions. Unfortunately, there are no other Data Scientists at my work to talk to about this. 

So, here we go!

The Landscape:
I am currently working with a dataset of 10 columns and about 28k rows of a particular physical product at my company. The ""segments"" initially proposed by the business are far outdated and have grown substantially over the last 20 years and are in dire need of reclassification. Thus, to find the underlying structure in this data, I decided to perform some unsupervised kmeans clustering on the dataset (all done in python). 

The sklearn algorithm was utilized with a pipeline implementation with StandardScaler, PCA (7 components = 95% variance), and KMeans (default 8 clusters) with a set random seed. 

The Suspicion:
After all was said and done, I mapped the cluster labels back to the dataframe and saved it to csv. After restarting the kernel and importing the data into a new notebook (gotta be weary of that data creep), I decided I would do a train_test_split (test_size = 0.33) on the labeled dataframe. After creating the new scaler, pca and kmeans model, I continued through the routine fit to X_train, y_train and created y_pred on model.predict(y_test). Following scikit-learn's cluster validations, I ran the following metric tests:

adjusted_rand_score
adjusted_mutual_info_score
homogeneity_completeness_v_measure

Not one of these tests resulted in a score of less than 0.974. I understand these tests assume there is a ground truth associated with the dataset. But after that I'm feeling a bit uneasy about how well the new model performed. 

So, Reddit, please tell me your thoughts! Did I absolutely botch this thing? Is it actually working out the way it should? Are there any other methods I should be looking into to validate these things?

Sorry for the wall of text and I thoroughly appreciate all and any feedback! ",28,17

This might not even be the correct avenue for these questions (and if that's the case, I apologize). My questions might be better suited for a coder(?). If so, let me know!

Anyway, I currently use Google Flights to find cheap airfare and also use their tracking feature where you can save the flight info/price and it will track the price whether it drops or raises.

I was hoping to find a way to link a google sheet to my saved flights and have a cell that updates when the price drops.

So my questions are:

- Is this possible? In theory, can I link my saved flights to a google sheet that would continuously pull/update the price?

ALSO

- Is it possible to set up a program that automatically searches google flights on a certain day if given all the info needed (airports, days traveling, etc.) and log that info into google sheets for me?

Example: I know I want to fly from LAX to EWR from Nov 15-20 (round trip). I'm not ready to look into prices now, so I'll have the program search the flights/prices that are available for my conditions on June 15 and log that info into a google sheet all while I'm asleep soundly in my comfy bed.

Sorry for my inexperience and if this is confusing at all haha

I'm keen to get into the data science and analytics field after having worked as an SAP functional consultant in the HR module for ten years.

I've taken some time and got a decent grip of major ML algorithms, statistical knowledge needed and have done a few projects using NLP, SVMs, logistic regression and so on. I've also done a few udemy courses to get acquainted with Tableau.( I've had python knowledge since before and now have an  understanding of how to apply it in this field. Have also learnt R now. )

The problem I'm facing is that I can (I suppose) realistically only target entry level jobs in this field, as most look for prior relevant experience. I've tried to  relate my past experience to analytics in terms of transferable skills, and indeed there is some overlap, but most recruiters don't even give a second glance at my application after hearing my previous salary. I've tried to convince them that salary isn't important to me as much as a good role to get into the field, but no luck so far.

781,2018-4-28,2018,4,28,18,8fixwd,Looking for a Data Science buddy!,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8fixwd/looking_for_a_data_science_buddy/,fart_in_th3_wind,1524909063,"Hi Data Scientists,

As the title suggests, I need a buddy to help guide me on my path to solving some data science problems I am working on.

A little background about me: I am a web developer by trade (10 years of PHP, MySQL, JS), based in the UK. I am currently a senior manager in the business I am in, and more recently have taken my hands off coding - but I can still do a session like the rest of them! I transition between all departments, but my main focus is sales, marketing and technical. My specialties are Business Intelligence and Product Innovation, and I am working on my soft skills such as leadership, negotiation, and people management.

I have had this one lingering data science problem in the back of my mind (often bringing to forefront then pushing back again) for a good 12 months now. I have built the BI tools to collect acquisition data e.g. where the users came from, how many, the churn/revenue generation over time, and Revenue Per User and I can query the data and compare it visually and see trends and forecast loosely how future data will perform if the day 0 characteristics are the same. But I have so many different ways to slice up/categorise the data. Its hard for me to gain the true value from the data without getting a computer to do the heavy lifting. For example, are 40 year old Italian males particularly high value users? Its hard for me to know what exactly is important in the data, I know all the data I would like to test but for me to test all these assumptions individually would be horrendously tedious. Also I believe that these assumptions/finding need to be continually tested moving forward to ensure they are still valid.

I initially thought that I had a machine learning problem on my hands, so I spent a week or so learning Python, trying out examples of regression, forecasting/predictions, euclidean distance etc, but in the end, besides learning some python and seeing the power of these tools for the individual examples I worked with. I am yet to find a way to apply these skills to my current use case.

I could get a contractor to come and spend some time working on this problem with me, but its very hard to hire well when you know so little about the subject matter, another issue is, as you can see above, I am struggling just to describe the problem and the outcomes I need. Having said that, Data is my #1 favourite thing to work with, and I am sure that if I can learn the skills I need to crack this problem, it will serve me time and time again in the future.

So I am reaching out to you guys (and girls), trying to find a buddy to shoot the breeze with, and discuss some data science skills along the way. I am not looking for anyone to put any actual hands on work into this, just help me with the terminology, and point out how I should go about solving the problem. Once I am pointed in the right direction of what I need to do, I am pretty self sufficient at learning.

In return, I am hoping there might be some reciprocal arrangement whereby I can help with some of your work challenges thats I may have more experience in. If not - then you get the feel good factor of helping someone along with their career.

Any takers?",6,5

Already having advanced knowledge of statistics, modeling, and research methods, the coding and technical aspects have been my biggest growth areas. I still have a lot to learn in terms of data engineering, but feel more than capable in ML/DL and, of course, traditional data analysis (DA). I finally got to job hunting and have two offers on the table:

To a lot of folks, I'm sure this question is going to be silly, but essentially I am considering between two data scientist roles, one that pays ***70k (Company A)*** and another that pays ***120k (Company B)***, both in ***California***, not SV/SF. 


**Company A: 70k/annually** 


A non-profit organization where I would be working with data to help people in need. The role would require me to do database engineering (very minimal knowledge so far) as well as advanced research based tasks, data analysis, ML/DL for product development and business strategy. I was totally transparent during the interview process that I am not a data engineer, but I'm willing to learn if they're willing to teach me. They offered me the job and are open to teaching me the ropes in terms of database architecture and anything I don't know CS wise. 70k is the cap and they can't budge since they are a non-profit. 

**Company B: 120k/annually** 


An e-commerce start-up focused on apparel. The job is very much focused on BI and DA however they have mentioned wanting to do some forms of ML/DL in the future using behavioral data that they have not yet started collecting. My role would be to conduct general business analysis on KPI's using things like google analytics, and power BI. I would also have access to the back-end website data stored in a SQL database that has some behavioral data, for which I will be using Python for extraction and new customer segmentation via clustering. Further, I'd be responsible for the creation of a data collection strategy to capture new data for future use. The development team is offshore, as opposed to Company A which is in-house. I spoke about doing things like ""Recommender systems"" and they mentioned working with an external agency to produce that. Further, the role was initial a Data Scientist/Analyst role, for which I negotiated to simply be ""Data Scientist"". Moreover, I would be the first data scientist on the team, though there are plans to bring in more later.

**My Dilemma**


Company A appeals to me because I will learn a lot and the job focuses more on ML/DL type tasks, which I think will provide me with much needed experience in the future. Then again, I would be taking a 10k pay-cut from my last job, and missing out on the 50k being offered by Company B. I know it's not about money, but the difference is substantial in my case. 

On the other hand, Company B appears less organized in terms of their data infrastructure. They're ambitious, but it will be incumbent upon me to drive any type of ML/DL work. We would have no data engineers, so I would likely need to learn how to do this on my own, which I can but will take some time. In terms of learning, I feel that I will learn less at Company B.


Would love to hear everyone's advice. I want to make the best decision possible and not regret it. ",12,5

The general idea is that words are states and probability of going from one state to other is what makes the transition.

So you have two transition matrix- one for spam and one for ham.

Then use Bayes' theorem to find given the test email(seen as sequence of words) find the probability that its spam. 

But then my confusion is what if a certain word that is in the new email is not in the transition matrices?

I am really confused. Any suggestions will help",4,16
820,2018-4-30,2018,4,30,19,8fycaw,Feedback on a neural net API for my written-from-scratch tensor library (x-post /r/neuralnetworks),https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8fycaw/feedback_on_a_neural_net_api_for_my/,Karyo_Ten,1525082433,"Hey, I've been working for a bit more than a year on my own tensor library from scratch (first commit on April 13, 2017).

What started as a hobby and curiosity project to learn more about linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning and a young programming language called Nim became a huge evening time sink.

After implementing Numpy-like ndarrays, Torch/Tensorflow like primitives, I just finalised the first part of my high-level API which hopefully takes the best from Keras and PyTorch.

Id like your feedback on that. Quick note on Nim, it is a strongly typed language, hence why you see f32/float32 from time to time.

For example, declaring a two-layers NN currently is like this:

    # ##################################################################
    # Environment variables
    
    # N is batch size; D_in is input dimension;
    # H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
    let (N, D_in, H, D_out) = (64, 1000, 100, 10)
    
    # Create the autograd context that will hold the computational graph
    let ctx = newContext Tensor[float32]
    
    # Create random Tensors to hold inputs and outputs, and wrap them in Variables.
    let
      x = ctx.variable(randomTensor[float32](N, D_in, 1'f32))
      y = randomTensor[float32](N, D_out, 1'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Define the model.
    
    network ctx, TwoLayersNet:
      layers:
        fc1: Linear(D_in, H)
        fc2: Linear(H, D_out)
      forward x:
        x.fc1.relu.fc2
    
    let
      model = ctx.init(TwoLayersNet)
      optim = model.optimizerSGD(learning_rate = 1e-4'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Training
    
    for t in 0 ..&lt; 500:
      let
        y_pred = model.forward(x)
        loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)
    
      echo &amp;""Epoch {t}: loss {loss.value[0]}""
    
      loss.backprop()
      optim.update()
This is a port of Jcjohnson PyTorch example: https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples#pytorch-autograd.

3 examples are available directly in my repo: https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/tree/master/examples.

A MNIST simple convnet with 2 conv layers, 1 hidden layer and automatic shape inference would be like this:

    randomize(42) # Random seed for reproducibility
    
    let
      ctx = newContext Tensor[float32] # Autograd/neural network graph
      n = 32                           # Batch size
    
    let
      x_train = read_mnist_images(""build/train-images.idx3-ubyte"").astype(float32) / 255'f32
      X_train = ctx.variable x_train.unsqueeze(1) # Change shape from [N, H, W] to [N, C, H, W], with C = 1
    
      y_train = read_mnist_labels(""build/train-labels.idx1-ubyte"").astype(int)
    
      x_test = read_mnist_images(""build/t10k-images.idx3-ubyte"").astype(float32) / 255'f32
      X_test = ctx.variable x_test.unsqueeze(1) Change shape from [N, H, W] to [N, C, H, W], with C = 1
      y_test = read_mnist_labels(""build/t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte"").astype(int)
    
    network ctx, DemoNet:
      layers:
        x:          Input([1, 28, 28])
        cv1:        Conv2D(x.out_shape, 20, 5, 5)
        mp1:        MaxPool2D(cv1.out_shape, (2,2), (0,0), (2,2))
        cv2:        Conv2D(mp1.out_shape, 50, 5, 5)
        mp2:        MaxPool2D(cv2.out_shape, (2,2), (0,0), (2,2))
        hidden:     Linear(mp2.out_shape.flatten, 500)
        classifier: Linear(500, 10)
      forward x:
        x.cv1.relu.mp1.cv2.relu.mp2.flatten.hidden.relu.classifier
    
    let model = ctx.init(DemoNet)
    let optim = model.optimizerSGD(learning_rate = 0.01'f32)
    
    . &lt; Training loop &gt; 
    
So what I would like to know is:

   - What are your main grips with the current neural networks library?
   - If you could do it yourself what syntax would you prefer to use for which use cases?
   - What do you think of my network declaration section?",2,4

As we know NNs require feature scaling. That rises a question: how to scale them properly to prevent giving away information about future prices, future feature values, which can be obtained by NN from the max and min of the range? In other words I find it not valid to scale the whole dataset (train + validation) with one scale. Can you give me a piece of advice how to approach this problem or provide me with further reading?
