I would love to hear your recommendations as to how I can best embark my learning journey.

___
**Background**

I graduated with a degree in Finance 5 years ago and have been working as an analyst in finance-related institutions (Banks, investment holding companies, etc.). My main responsibilities included analysis, report generation and analysis using Microsoft Excel. Recently, I moved to an operations role (as an analyst) in a logistics company. The job requirements are broadly similar, but my department is expanding towards data analytics. Coming from literally 0 programming knowledge, I researched online and Python seems to be one of the more popular programming languages used for data analytics.

___
**Readings &amp; Practicing**

I started learning the basic of Pythons with [Coursera's Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python). This gave me a fundamental understanding of Python and it's capabilities. 

Upon completion, I started viewing Corey Schafer's videos on YouTube. I have also enrolled in edx's [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2019a/course/) which started this week.

After speaking to my manager, he recommended me to first understand the fundamentals behind data science and understand the scientific approaches to learning from data and using it to tell the story. 

To start off he recommended Coursera's course on [Basic statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics). After which, he recommended me to combine what I've learnt and embark on [Statistics with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python).

All of this is overwhelming as I find myself jumping back and forth between learning Python and Statistics. If I were to focus on Statistics, how in-depth (Advanced Statistics?) do I have to go before embarking on Python?

Any comments is greatly appreciated! Thank you",5,0

Recently graduated and found a great graduate job at a relatively high profile bank. I was initially nervous as hell going into work on day 1 because I really wanted to give my best and tackle challenges but it's been a very chill couple of weeks so far. The role I applied for is within Data Analytics (Graduate) and I feel like a good part of the reason why I got the role is because of my previous data science intern/contract role where I actually helped out with Python/R coding in relation to machine learning and predictive modelling. At the bank right now, everything is so slow paced and there is barely any predictive/ML modelling at all, the only coding being automation and churning out graphs using ggplot2.

Is this normal?

I'm thinking of maybe just doing side projects in my spare time to keep up with my interest in modelling because currently, all I can see happening within my team of 8 is basic SQL queries and R scripts that slice/dice Excel spreadsheets.",17,16

Is it actually necessary? How powerful would a normal computer have to be to be able to do the analysis (the most demanding process I imagine will be topic modelling with k &lt; 50).

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 2 years of experience in 2 entirely different realms of engineering. I'm miserable. My current job pays extremely well, with great benefits, etc. But I am miserable. There is almost no technical aspect to it, and it is nearly entirely administrative in nature. I'm bored to death every day, plus I have quite a long commute each way.

My first job had a one time programming/data analysis project and I fell in love. I have since taken online courses in python and more recently SQL to further my skillset. I reached out to a local internet startup senior data scientist and explained my predicament. He then sent me an analyst assessment, which I enjoyed working on and completed... and just got back to me saying he thinks I would be a good fit in their summer internship program next year.

There is no way I could financially afford to leave my current job for an internship. I had such a good feeling about that assessment, that I just feel absolutely depleted right now. Worthless even. I know I would have a lot to learn, but I also am very confident I have the aptitude to learn and excel in those things. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to make the switch?",3,1

From what I have learnt from that is the mean and variance have to constant. I got the mean part but not the variance . 

Take this for example : I got this learning form Mike Crowson YouTube video on ARIMA modelling on SPSS.

[A simple time series plot of 20 observation dataset with two variables : week and quality \(of computer products\) ](https://i.redd.it/mr8mwxamydk31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

[A differencing of one is done to make the mean constant but variance is not \(atleast as stated in the paper\)](https://i.redd.it/do6rrvfbzdk31.jpg)

What the paper says :

""The series now appears stationary with respect to central tendency, so second differencing does

not appear necessary. However, the variability seems to be increasing over time. Transformation is

considered for series in which variance changes over time and differencing does not stabilize the

variance (cf. Box et al., 1994; McCleary &amp; Hay, 1980). The logarithmic transformation is appropriate.

Because of the zero and negative values in qual\_1, with -11 the largest negative value, 12, is

added before computing the log .""

[And now the series is stationarised i.e. the variance is also constant.](https://i.redd.it/mn3pp7uwzdk31.jpg)

The paper continues :

""The transformed difference is plotted to see if both mean and variance are now stabilized, as

seen in the figure.

Although the scale has changed, the transformed difference does not appear to have less variability

than the untransformed difference. There is also the usual problem of increased difficulty of

interpretation of transformed variables. Therefore, the untransformed difference is used in future

analyses.""

But I honestly don't see the difference . So my question is essentially how do you know the variance is not constant ? Also do I have to use Log Transform only when the variance is not constant.",3,0

&amp;#x200B;

The data set is comprised of various types of complaints across multiple addresses (the location of the complaints is given in columns regarding the incident-actual address, zipcode and latitude and longitude-that I ended up using to make some folium maps for better visualization).

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up merging this data set with the open PLUTO datasets regarding that region to add some information regarding the building features hoping to find a connection between the building features and the complaints I see.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, when trying to find correlations all the information that I think is more valuable like the addresses of where the complaints are happening is lost (thinking Spearman, Pearson, even feature selection). 

Is the one hot encoding approach good enough in this case?

I would love to have some input, especially if I am completely off on how to approach this problem.

I've found it's way easier and faster to learn in a team and so I'm looking for someone with whom I could collaborate on Kaggle projects. I'd say my level is intermediate, I'm currently most interested in recommendation engines and NLP but I'm definitely into things like default risk or fraud detection too.

I also have a blog bicorner.net (it's a barren there actually now) and my kaggle profile is: www.kaggle.com/jirakst (The Titanic competition shows wrong result, I scored Top 10% and Top 4%).

I'll be most happy if you join me in either of those and belive we can move together a mile ahead!

I wasn't upset or anything since the project was just 10% completed but I chose her simply because her works are on the specific DS field I'm working on (e.g. DS predictive models).

I do have other DS supervisor but they are either working on some other things (e.g. visualisation and interactivity), or they are basically purely CS supervisor (not necessarily working on DS or working on hybrid DS works e.g. Security on Big Data).

So my choices are now:

1. DS supervisor that's working on other unrelated fields
2. CS supervisor that's working on hybrid DS + CS fields
3. CS supervisor that's not working on DS

I really don't have much of a choice but I'd like to minimise any risks that I may not be able to foresee - frankly, I'm a bit delusional right now since I didn't expect the DS supervisor to bail on me : /

My questions:

1. Suppose my only option is (2) or (3) for some reason, would a normal CS supervisor be sufficient?
2. Would it matter to just work with (1)?

Hello everyone, 

After 10+ years of working for the same company, I've creeped my title up to 'Manager of Data Analysis'. The pay is already overlapping to that of a Data Scientist but in actuality, my technical knowledge beyond Tableau (certified), scripting, and Advanced SQL is minimal (basically, I'm overpaid, slightly underskilled). I know that leaving this company will come with a drastic pay decrease so I want to get my golden parachute ready - especially if the market takes a hit in the near future. 

I'm considering SMU because it appears to be the most reputable DS education close to me (Houston). If I decide to enroll part-time, my employer would cover $15k of tuition. I have a nest-egg of cash that I can spend towards on the remainder of tuition (\~$40k).   
I'm well aware that my potential salary won't increase much after graduation (probably $20k increase). I'd prefer to continue working for this company but the Data Scientist positions open here require a Masters and an intimidating knowledge base. **My question is,** is it better to do self-study and boost my skill set on my own, or take the formal route and ascertain a solid education and long-term credibility in the market?

I am starting to collect and analyze some medical claims data for my new project and thinking about which methods could be appropriate for inference purposes. 

The main idea is to look at these claims and find factors/variables/events that lead to an event of observation stay as a follow up for your hospital stay/outpatient procedure/or other medical procedures. 

The problem is that some people have only one medical claim, and some may have more than one claim. At first I thought about simply using logistic regression for inference purposes, but not I am not so sure because I think that the assumption of independence might be violated here. 

So, the question is: are two separate claims for the the same person/member considered as independent observations in the data or not?

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a senior double majoring in Finance and Management Information Systems with a 3.6 GPA. I ave also had two internships throughout college one in sales (thank you working at a call center throughout college) and operations analysis at a bank. I graduate in a few months and have been going through my job search bouncing between roles specific to my major. A lot of financial analyst roles and business intelligence analysts. Given the way the world is changing and how interesting I find the type of work I am really leaning towards a career starting as a business intelligence analyst. One day, I would love to even be a data scientist. At this point though the job search has been lacking and I am wondering if, to achieve this data science track, I should stay for one last year (I am already graduating early) and get my Masters in Information Science. Is this a good idea or should I just stick to trying to get an analyst role and go forward with a master. Or, should I stick with the financial analyst route although automation is creeping on the field. Thank you all for any and all advice I really do appreciate it.

I am concerned because these residuals are less than zero and because the residuals tend to become more negative as the frequency increases.  These residuals are coming from a GLM using the poisson family and a log link.  In case it's helpful, this is in an insurance setting where the frequency is about 5%.  What do you think are these residuals the sign the model is not performing well?  If so, what can I do to improve the model performance.  I could tweak variables more, but I can't tell if this is a sign that there is something systemic wrong with my model.  Could using a negative binomial distribution help?

I wanted to figure out which one of two ways to teach a specific topic to children would be better. So I got 15 classes together roughly half learns about that topic one way and the rest learns about it the other way. They all do the same exam 1 month before, directly after and 3 months after the ""intervention"". I then analyzed the exam results to figure out which one was better.

So I'm now writing the ""Methods"" part of my paper and since I'm doing this for the first time I'm looking at a lot of other papers from my university and how they did it. They all seem to have a chapter about ""Forschungsinstrument"" which I translated to research instrument and I hope I'm correct about that. Most of them have a ""questionaire"" as instrument and are writing about how they put it together and what you have to be aware of when creating a questionaire and citing sources on the topic of questionaires. I'm now not sure if I should say that my instrument was an exam. I'm not even sure if this is valid. It's not really a questionaire either because it is built entirely different.

I started a job as a data analyst for a cleaning company that services a big 4 tech company (on site, fully dedicated to 1 client right now)  and have been there for a few months now. When I was hired, I was told to just ""improve our technology platform"" because that was the main complaint from the client about the account. I'll add that due to the nature of the industry, I'm pretty much the only developer in the entire company. 

from the start, the instructions were really vague and direction was only ever just ""make it better"". I started by identifying weakness in current processes, and trying to automate things. At this point, I've moved the whole reporting stuff over from manual spreadsheets to SQL and airflow and an automated system, which has been pretty successful.

However, at this point, I've reached a few snags that I'm not sure what to do about. First, I've realized that no-one really cares or uses what I've built (dashboards have like 1 view every 2 weeks), despite getting overwhelmingly positive feedback. Second, any and all analysis that I could potentially do is limited by non-existent data - where the only way to get it would be through people entering stuff through forms. I've brought this up with some of the team, but they have some resistance due to the tedious nature of forms.

At this point, I'm honestly what sure I'm supposed to do. Nobody has complained about any of my work, but at the same time nobody comes to me asking me for analysis or anything either. 

I just wanted to reach out to Reddit and see if there were any other solo developers / analysts that had similar experiences and to see how you handled it. (or advice)

Very hesitantly I call myself a data scientist, for the lack of a better word. That term is used very loosely these days. Anyways.

The work is typically like doing some EDA, running simulations for loyalty programs, doing some regression analysis, sometimes doing segmentation on customers using basic SQL/Pandas queries (occasionally using ML techniques), coming up with algorithms for lead scoring, etc.

I have to constantly switch between requirements, tasks are assigned verbally or over email, there's no tracking system in place.

The people I have to deal with don't seem to appreciate that it takes time and effort to write code, generate insights, verify the results, present them in a format that non-tech sales people will understand. Besides, as in any analytics/ML project, the first approach we try seldom works. Data science is as much an iterative process as software development is IMHO. Not to mention that data is never available in a clean format. I have to spend a lot of time cleaning it before I can use it for producing results.

Usually, I get a problem statement at time t, and at t+24 hours, I'm asked for results. I find this difficult to cope with. I come from a software engineering background, where I was used to working on one problem at a time. Nobody expects daily deliverables in a software dev job (at least at no good company again IMHO). Because quality work takes time. There are times when you just don't hit your zone and get stuck at seemingly trivial problems. You need breaks, you need time to relax.

My company doesn't seem to understand this. They are mostly sales/business people who just expect ""decks"" (powerpoint presentations). They have no idea what kind of effort goes into real data science projects.

I have tried to discuss this with my manager that the deadlines are too near and too frequent. Data analytics is not a one day job. But he thinks I have a very pessimistic attitude. I was aghast after hearing that from him.

I just wanted some insight from fellow DS professionals as two which career path would lead me to data science. 

Job 1:  Cost of Care Consultant: I would be primarily identifying cost savings opportunities with analytics but there is a bit of a PM aspect to follow the opportunity and see it to fruition. Involves creating cost saving models and a bit of finance work. I would work in SQL and Tableau. Data is only from our DW and involves aggregated data (at a PMPM level for those healthcare folks). Only DS path I can see here is if I develop some model on my own that helps predicts high cost inpatient stays or something along those lines. 

Job 2: Health Information Management Consultant: This role seems interesting because I will have access down to member health records. The main goal of this role is to improve patient healthcare quality and recommending interventions where it's appropriate. ETL, SQL, Python and Tableau is involved. Data sources seem to come from our DW, Providers and Physicians.

That is my high level understanding of the two roles - I'm hoping there are folks here in the health industry that may understand these roles better and able to recommend a path that will most likely lead to DS. TIA!",7,0

Brief summary of my experience:

* 6 months internship data scientist at a startup
* 4 years data analyst/data scientist at a mid size tech company
* 1 year machine learning team lead at a startup
* 1 year backend engineer at a recently acquired and now large tech company which Im trying to get out of

Problem is, my experience is a bit scattered and my career goals are to maximise my salary before the tech bubble bursts lol.

* my engineering experience is only level 4 by big tech standards due to lack of large scale cross-team projects, (which is hard on my ego due to the fact that Im quite a bit older thanks to grad school)
* I dont have enough leadership experience for most manager jobs (and Im not sure I want to be a pure manager)
* I cant get a senior DS job since I seem to always fumble stats questions, maybe due to never studying it formally ... I know I can work things out as I need them, but I dont know what the right answers are in interviews. 

My favourite job by far was at the startup which was a great mix of management, DS and engineering, so part of me just wants to try and find another good startup. But I also want to invest wisely in my career.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to take some stats courses and/or stick it out in big tech backend engineering to level up? Or do I have enough experience already to make it as a generalist in a startup or consulting?",54,73

It's a dataset collected via a survey; each row is a dataset filled with information re. diet habits, physical activity, the fact of taking supplements or not, personal goals, type of medication (if any) taken and so on.

Majority of features are categorical (aka factors), except one - item\_total - which is the amount each user spent on some product. 

My objective is to cluster these questionnaires based on the available features. 

I use the R language for performing this task. 

My current approach is:

1)  I calculate gower distance via daisy package aka dissimilarity matrix 

`gower.dist &lt;- daisy(df[,-1], metric = c(""gower""))`

 where `df` is the dataframe.

2)  I use [agglomerative hierarchical](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fastcluster/versions/1.1.25/topics/hclust) clustering.

`aggl.clust.c &lt;- hclust(gower.dist, method = ""complete"")`

3) I find the optimal amount of clusters via silhouette method.

I would like to check other clustering techniques out. Keep in mind that the features are mainly factors so k-mean-like techniques woulds be underperforming if not impossible at all to apply.

At the age of 26, I returned to education to study a BSc and MSci in Natural Sciences here in the UK. I did very well, was awarded a undergraduate research scholarship, and ultimately graduated with a 1st Class honours, and top of my cohort.

This led to several funded PhD offers in computational physics. I accepted one at a top London university, with a professor that was very well known in his (admittedly obscure, no practical application) field. Unfortunately, things didnt go as planned (death of a close family member, disillusionment, crippling imposter syndrome), and I decided to submit as an MPhil rather than continue to PhD. Sat my viva, got through corrections, graduated in Dec 2018. 

During that time, I also built my own small business in a non-tech field. We learned a lot, and we get by (just about). But it isnt sustainable as a career, and I genuinely dont enjoy the work. Ive been learning DS in my spare time over the last few months, and Im so happy to be working on something that challenges and stimulates me again! I even managed to get some interviews for DS positions. But I fell at the last hurdle when they realised that my skills arent up to scratch. 

So, heres my question - this is mainly directed at the more experienced among you, and those involved in hiring. Im very seriously considering investing a lot of time and money into one of the better known DS bootcamps. Given my background, and the fact that Ill be competing with hordes of equally, and more, skilled people 10 years my junior... am I in with a chance in todays saturated market, post bootcamp? 

Im now in my mid-30s, and it really does feel like my last chance at anything resembling a career.

I'm looking for feedback on our soon to launch partner program for gravityAI. We are a marketplace for algorithms, targeted at larger enterprise organizations and government. We hope to help data scientists monetize their creations, while simultaneously helping enterprise companies leverage cool stuff. You can check out a short explainer here: [http://www.gravityaimarket.com/](http://www.gravityaimarket.com/) and click on the play button.

Below is the partner program specifics. I guess what I'm looking for is,

1. Does it make sense?
2. Is the structure of the pay and incentive appropriate?
3. Would anyone be interested in learning more or participating in our beta?

# The Partner Launch Program

At Gravity AI, we understand how difficult it can be for data scientists with valuable IP to package and sell their technology to big companies. We simplify this process by containerizing your algorithm, then adding a security layer thats often required by enterprise IT, and finally making your algorithm available to enterprise through a simple web interface. 

As we prepare for public launch, we are inviting data scientists like you to work with us in a few ways. The marketplace is ready to begin seeding algorithms, and we are actively building a select group of First Sellers, who have algorithms they own and would like to sell. We are also adding Curators, who can help us find and assess open-source algorithms to package for the enterprise. Lastly, we are expanding our team with data scientists who are willing to work part-time.

| | FIRST SELLERS|GRAVITY CURATOR|PART-TIME |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| What is it? |Opportunity for data scientists who have developed and own algorithm(s) they want to sell to enterprise clients on our platform. | Were searching for algorithms that might be valuable to our clients in Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, and Travel. If you know these industries and know where to find relevant algorithms, become a Curator. | We need help vetting algorithms, working with our engineers to upload algorithms to our platform, and potentially training algorithms. |
|How does it work?| 1. Send us your algorithm as a zip file, along with a detailed description and documentation. 2. We will assess your program to ensure it functions as described and is relevant to our clients. 3. After review, we will work with you to get the algorithm listed for purchase in our marketplace. | 1. Review our list of High Priority algorithms. 2. Search online data science communities, message boards, Github, and other places to find relevant algorithms. 3. Send us the list of algorithms youve identified. | We will work with you to define a Statement of Work that aligns with your skill-set and available time. |
|What's in it for me? | Our team will review your algorithm, and you will be compensated in the following way(s): If your algorithm is on our High Priorities list of programs, you will be compensated $1,000 after review and acceptance. If your algorithm is pre-trained on a high value vertical (financial data for example), then you will be compensated an additional $1,000 after review and acceptance. Once your algorithm is listed on our platform, you will be paid a percentage of the monthly fee our clients pay to use your algorithm, in perpetuity. | Our team will review the algorithms you find, and you will be compensated in the following ways: If the algorithm is listed on our marketplace, you will be compensated a one-time fee of $100. If the algorithm listed on our marketplace is pre-trained on a high valued vertical, you will be compensated an additional one-time fee of $100. | You will be compensated hourly, with an opportunity to interview for full-time roles if/when they become available. |",9,8

I am concerned because these residuals are less than zero and because the residuals tend to become more negative as the frequency increases. These residuals are coming from a GLM using the poisson family and a log link. In case it's helpful, this is in an insurance setting where the frequency is about 5%. What do you think are these residuals a sign the model is not performing well? If so, what can I do to improve the model performance. I could tweak variable bucketing / definitions more, but I can't tell if this is a sign that there is something systemic wrong with my model. Could using a negative binomial distribution help?

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07953](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07953)

Abstract:

Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71.",1,1

Hi all -

I was pointed here from another sub and told that you may be able to help me out here. Hopefully this post is in line with this sub's rules.

Here's the deal ... I am attempting to do research on Google PPC campaigns. I have used AHREFS to download a spreadsheet containing the information for an organization's entire PPC campaign (643 rows of data, precisely).

This is the information I have:

1. The keyword the ad is focused on (ie., what people have to search to see the ad on the search results)
2. The volume (the number of people who search for the term per month)
3. Difficulty (the number on a scale from 1-100 on how hard would it be to rank in the top ten results organically)
4. Traffic (the percentage of organic traffic that has historically clicked on ads for that search term)
5. The number of results in Google for the search term (not sure this is even relevant)
6. The cost-per-click (what the advertiser must pay Google each time somebody clicks on the ad)

My hope is to be able to construct a statistical model in SPSS that correlates which keyword is most worth while ""to go after"" after all the various factors I listed above are considered. Maybe, if I may, the ""sweet spot"" between cost and traffic?

Any thoughts or advice on how to go about getting that setup in SPSS would be more than appreciated.

Again: I am more than grateful for any help you can provide.

My end goals is to be a data scientist, which course will best prepare me for that role. 

**Advanced Econometrics:** 

The linear regression model will be presented in matrix form and basic  asymptotic theory will be introduced. The course will also introduce  students to basic time series methods for forecasting and analyzing  economic data. Students will be expected to apply the tools to real  data. 

**Service Operations Management:** 

The course addresses both strategic analysis and operational decision making, with emphasis on the later. Among the topics covered are: the service concept and operations strategy, service delivery system design, capacity management, response time (queueing) analysis, yield management, productivity and quality evaluation and management, and the impact of new information technologies. The current trend in off-shoring will be examined both from service providers and customers perspective.",1,2

Ive been in the analytics industry for about a year now, and have slowly been coming to the realization that serving the needs of whatever company I work for is not going to be fulfilling. To be clear, I dont mean that the work isnt satisfying, challenging, and stimulating, just that doing this type of work isnt *fulfilling*. Furthermore, I feel as if it is unfair of me to put that kind of weight on a job which, by its nature, is designed to simply keep making people money.

Without getting into the weeds too much, I want to take the skills and techniques Ive been able to develop through my schooling, side projects, and my day job, and use them for something that could be fulfilling. I also want to be able to help my community (I live in the Saint Louis, MO area; theres no shortage of social issues around here). I know that there are hackathons and similar competitions that present themselves every few months, but I want something a little more consistent.  In short, I want to form a group  of likeminded people who would get together on a regular basis to tackle social issues in the area, like crime rates, child death, etc.

Would anyone happen to know how to go about starting such a project, and how to keep it going? Ive checked out apps like Meetup to try and see if such a thing exists here and, and it seems like there is a panel that might meet up every now and then, but other than that my search hasnt yielded anything.

However in this case I only have two given features. I don't want to just literally run a RF model on those two features as my whole entire project.

I'm a recent college grad with a BA in Economics and a Comp Sci minor who wants to eventually end up in Data Science.

Are these tools what I ""graduate"" into from doing projects in a .ipynb where I'm, for example, looking at features of a csv dataset of emails to predict whether they're spam or not? 

Also, some data analyst positions I'm applying to (because data scientist itself seems above my paygrade until I do more machine learning stuff in grad school hopefully) place a lot of focus on Excel (with VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables being considered ""advanced""); is that a bit of a red flag in the sense I won't be learning much towards pivoting out of Data Analyst into Data Scientist?

Ive read a lot of posts about people comming from different majors that want to get into data science. A lot of those people arent sure about what steps they could take in order to maximize their chances at becomming a data scientist.

In this post I want to share my journey as someone with probably the worst major ever to become a data scientist. 

Note: this is my journey, your journey could be completely different, this post just showcasses a way a person with a wrong major could work hisself into the data science field.

**Year 1 psychology**
- had no idea what to do
- passed all classs but nothing more

**1 st half of Year 2 psychology**
- halfway year 2 I came to the conclusion that I was in the wrong major.
- wanted to quit my major and start another major in computer science
- study advisor told me Id better finsih my bachelor go from a premaster to a master in data science

At this point I was completely freaked out and doubted everything about my academic career.

Every minute I spent on psychology felt like wasted time, so I had to do something about it

I decided it was time to take learning into my own hands and to not just learn the subjects my university major suggested me to take

**2nd half of year 2 psychology**
- After a massive search online for what was needed to become a data scientist I decided I needed to learn python
- I followed and completed an online udemy course in python in my free time

Summer before 3rdyear
-prepared myself for calculus I wanted to take next year

3rd year of psychology
- started a minor in computer science
- learned SQL and some basic data science algoritms in python (the online course helped so much)
- followed an elective; matrix algebra
- followed an elective; calculus 1
- followed an elective; vector calculus

4th year 
- planning to do a master in data science
- altho Im still behind, I think my journey could send a sign to companies that Im willing to learn


Right now Im doing a minor in computer science where I learn SQL, data mining in Python (simple regression amd classifocation problems) and some introduction course for Java.

Im also taking extra courses in matrix Algebra and Calc 1.",11,0

Ive been mostly working with python and SQL as a member of the data engineering team. 

I cant tell if Im just over thinking it but I feel like Im disappointing my entire data team. Ive been incredibly anxious at work due to feeling stupid and performing below expectations. It feels like every single member of the team is a genius and working as a cohesive team while Im easily the most junior member that gets largely ignored. This has the negative side effect of making me self conscious about socializing or making friends at work even though everyone around me is really nice and friendly.  

Everyones been working long hours including weekends and Im usually hesitant to ask questions because of how unimportant my work is compared to what theyre working on. I do also think that struggling through a problem is good for me in the long run although it can be quite frustrating in the short term. 

Whenever I do ask questions, I try to be as thorough as possible to show that Ive thought deeply about the problem, but it feels like my manager would rather work on his own stuff. This is my first real 9-5 job and  Id appreciate any advice on navigating my situation. Feels like I just word vomited my feelings so thanks for reading if you did.

There is a string variable called FullNarrative. Sometimes, its a single paragraph giving context to what the officer(s)/victim were doing before an incident took place and sometimes, its a link to an article outlining the event. With other string variables like NatureOfStop, I used the BJS definition of different types of crime and labeled if an event was a property crime, violent crime, drug-related crime, mental health related, etc. 

Working with the variable NatureOfStop took a lot of labor, and Im not sure if what I did for that variable would be the best use of my time, especially when Im given a small paragraph with lots of detail.

The company started in 2015 but have grown rapidly in recent years (a hundred employees now - the rapid expansion is a concern for me, but that's another story). My problem is that I'm not from the UK so I have no idea if the salary they're offering is within the market range for the local industry, and how it compares to cost-of-living, etc (rent in Cambridge is expensive!). I've tried to do some research online (Glassdoor, etc) but the results vary wildly.

They've offered me about GBP 55k per year, plus benefits (life/health insurance, pension, etc). 

Some background about me: I have a Master's degree in biomedical engineering. I worked for about four years doing clinical research and R&amp;D of surgical products, but for the last year(ish) I've been working on a fixed-term contract writing code for a team of actuaries in the finance industry. This is where I picked up my skills in AWS, Python, databases, ETL, etc. This contract is coming to an end soon, though, which is why I'm looking for the next thing.

The company also wants me there soon because I have European citizenship (don't live in Europe though), so would need to be living in the UK before Brexit happens to secure my right to live and work there. We both know that there's no guarantee that Brexit will even happen in October, but it's a risk that we need to manage.

Please help guys, what are your thoughts here? Is this a decent offer or are they low-balling me?

&amp;#x200B;

This post covers some of the essential statistical modeling frameworks and methods for Python, which can help us do statistical modeling and probabilistic computation.

&amp;#x200B;

* Introduction: Why Python for data science
* Why these frameworks are necessary
* Start with NumPy
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
* Using Seaborn and Matplotlib
* SciPy for inferential statistics
* Statsmodels for advanced modeling
* Scikit-learn for statistical learning
* Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

# Why these frameworks are necessary

&amp;#x200B;

While Python is most popular for data wrangling, visualization, general machine learning, deep learning and associated linear algebra (tensor and matrix operations), and web integration, its statistical modeling abilities are far less advertised. A large percentage of data scientists still use other special statistical languages such as R, MATLAB, or SAS over Python for their modeling and analysis.

While each of these alternatives offer their own unique blend of features and power for statistical analyses, its useful for an up-and-coming data scientist to know more about various Python frameworks and methods that can be used for routine operations of descriptive and inferential statistics.

The biggest motivation for learning about these frameworks is that statistical inference and probabilistic modeling represent the bread and butter of a data scientists daily work. However, only by using such Python-based tools can a powerful end-to-end data science pipeline (a complete flow extending from data acquisition to final business decision generation) be built using a single programming language.

&amp;#x200B;

If using different statistical languages for various tasks, you may face some problems. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* Conducting any web scraping and database access using SQL commands and Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and SQLalchemy
* Cleaning up and preparing your data tables using Pandas, but then switching to R or SPSS for performing statistical tests and computing confidence intervals
* Using ggplot2 for creating visualization, and then using a standalone LaTeX editor to type up the final analytics report
* Switching between multiple programmatic frameworks makes the process cumbersome and error-prone.

&amp;#x200B;

What if you could do statistical modeling, analysis, and visualization all inside a core Python platform? Lets see what frameworks and methods exist for accomplishing such tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

# Start with NumPy

&amp;#x200B;

NumPy is the de-facto standard for numerical computation in Python, used as the base for building more advanced libraries for data science and machine learning applications such as TensorFlow or Scikit-learn. For numeric processing, NumPy is much faster than native Python code due to the vectorized implementation of its methods and the fact that many of its core routines are written in C (based on the CPython framework).

&amp;#x200B;

Although the majority of NumPy related discussions are focused on its linear algebra routines, it offers a decent set of statistical modeling functions for performing basic descriptive statistics and generating random variables based on various discrete and continuous distributions.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, lets create a NumPy array from a simple Python list and compute basic descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The code for this article may be found at [Kites Github repository.](https://github.com/kiteco/kite-python-blog-post-code/blob/master/statistical-modeling/)

&amp;#x200B;

    import numpy as np
    
    # Define a python list
    a_list = [2, 4, -1, 5.5, 3.5, -2, 5, 4, 6.5, 7.5]
    
    # Convert the list into numpy array
    an_array = np.array(a_list)
    
    # Compute and print various statistics
    print('Mean:', an_array.mean())
    print('Median:', np.median(an_array))
    print('Range (Max - min):', np.ptp(an_array))
    print('Standard deviation:', an_array.std())
    print('80th percentile:', np.percentile(an_array, 80))
    print('0.2-quantile:', np.quantile(an_array, 0.2))

The results are as follows:

    Mean: 3.5
    Median: 4.0
    Range (Max - min): 9.5
    Standard deviation: 2.9068883707497264
    80th percentile: 5.699999999999999
    0.2-quantile: 1.4000000000000001

It is not uncommon for geospatial data to get large, especially when you are dealing with Raster data. A few gigabytes of data is very common and most of the desktop GIS software (like ArcGIS and QGIS etc.) are usually able to handle that much data.  
But what if the data gets really huge? Like in Terabytes or Petabytes?

Im currently through 3 rounds of interviews for a Manager of Data Analytics position with a 3rd party company that works with a large network of college athletic departments. The athletic department I would work with would be considered an elite midwestern university. 

We are at the point where well need to be on the same page compensation wise before they bring me out for the final interview with the athletic department. I was curious if anyone had previous experience in a role like this or in a similar sport analytics situation and what would be a reasonable salary request?

Some background:
- alumni of the university Id work with
- MS in data analytics and grad certificate in MIS
- 1.5 years working as an analyst for an investment firm (current job)
- 3 years as an analytics intern/consultant in Division I sports (undergrad/grad)
- Tableau/R/SQL/SPSS experience
- Job requires me to move halfway across the country
- Cost of living would be ~5% cheaper
- Will have to pay out the remaining 6 months of my current lease
- Significantly unhappy with my current role/responsibilities

I know sport organizations are typically able to acquire talent at a slight discount due to the wow factor of working in sports. Any insight regarding current manager of DA salaries, salaries in sports, or input on this current situation is greatly appreciated. Apologies for the vagueness of a few details.",13,5

I've heard that having data science projects is important when you don't have applicable experience, but jumping into it right out of undergrad seemed really overwhelming. In school, they just assigned you tasks and clean data sheets which you could do pretty formulaically, but having to construct a project on my own, I found myself to be out of my depth.


The course I was looking at was the following: https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/certificates/data-science

First of all, my apologies for creating another laptop advice post, but I couldn't find one that covered my exact question.

Anyways, I have a bit of money from a research grant to get a new laptop for data science projects. I think I've decided to switch over to Linux (from Windows on a Lenovo laptop), and am thinking of going with a System 76 laptop with Pop OS. Due to the grant, I have a clear amount of funding that I have available for this. But I am torn between two options: either get a lower end model (either Galaga Pro or Darter Pro) with the highest memory and processor options available, or get a higher end model (Oryx Pro) with a better GPU but with weaker memory and processor options.

At this point, I don't use deep learning much at all, but I do a lot of machine learning. The real issue is that we don't really know what we're going to be doing on this project, and I personally don't know where my career will take me. With this in mind, which of the two options do you think would be wiser? A stronger overall machine without NVIDIA graphics, or a weaker machine with better graphics capabilities?

The problem I'm having is casting my research experience in a way that is meaningful to those making hiring decision in the data science space.

To that end, I've created a table with my experiences and attempts to ""translate"" them into action and result. The sections of the table are grouped by position. My draft resume can be found [here](http://hireGrant.com/resume.pdf) for more information.

I am doing some analysis for a freight onselling company. The way this works is anyone can go on the website and say I want to move 3 boxes from A to B and book a job with one of the carriers plugged into their system. They then book with the carrier and add margin on top, pretty straight forward. Obviously the prices are linked to the number and dimensions (including weight) of the items being freighted. However, they are purely digital and never see the goods, meaning that a discrepancy in the items (say, the dimensions are off) only becomes apparent once the carrier picks it up and then sends the freight onseller a bill with an extra charge that then needs to be sent to the customer.  


The goal of the project is to try develop a model which can reasonably accurately (&gt;90%) predict if a given job is going to result in extra charges. Data available are things like: the customer id, their shipping and payment history, key words associated with the goods (if given, it's a free text field), type of items (boxes vs pallets and things).   


At the time of the booking the company records the quote it gets from the carrier, an expected cost, and then we can compare that with what the bill actually ended up being. My attempts thus far have tried both making a model to predict the 'actual' cost itself via regression as well as defining a booking to be a 'loss' if the difference between the quoted and actual cost is above some threshold, and then doing classification as loss/not loss.   


Things are complicated by the fact that sometimes this difference is in the company's favour, i.e. the carrier just fails to bill for something they quoted for, and I consider this just a source of random noise i can't imagine we will ever be able to model.  


Obviously I cannot give the data here but the idea is to simply outline below my attempts to get signal from this data and the outcomes and I would greatly appreciate any inputs as to if I am missing something, doing something stupid, or maybe doing everything reasonably well but there is simply not enough signal to get the kind of accuracy we want.  


1.) Data cleaning. I won't go into detail here as it's a bit boring but suffice to say some of this was required to remove certain customers known to exist in special categories, as well as ensure that the categorical variables, like the item type, were only sourced from a list that made sense (for example some older movements had types like 'Boxes' and later ones were 'Box' so obviously that needed fixing)  


2.) Exploration/engineering. The first pass of this was simply define what I thought might be indicative. Broadly broken down into: item details (dimensions, # items, weight), itinerary details (from/to location information), customer history (up to that point in time, how many purchases had they made, how many of those constituted a 'loss', the historical mean of the quoted vs actual costs up to that point, revenue up to that point, etc). Categorical variables like the item types were one hot encoded.  


This is where the first issues seem to arise. For example, I went ahead and computed the correlation coefficient (pearsons, spearman, and kendall just to see if differences could be informative) of all the ordinal features with each other and then cramers V for the remaining categorical ones, and finally anova between mixed. If i considered the 'loss' (0 or 1) and the cost difference as the current target variables, the highest any of these got was \~ 0.2. So, superficially not much to go on here but maybe that's not surprising: this might be a complex thing we're trying to model and the hope of an ML approach is that maybe we can discover a combination of these features that together does actually correlate with the target variable. Even so, seems no obvious low hanging fruit  


3.) Modeling. To that end, i decided to see how far one could get by simply trying a handful of models. For this, as noted, i tried both classification based on loss and trying to predict the actual costs. I made sure to try both scaling and not scaling my input features (using a couple of different scalers on offer from sklearn). I tried things like the basic NN, trees of varying depth and restriction (i.e. min number of leaf notes to avoid overfitting), Ridge and Lasso linear models, and XGboost.   


As a first test i made sure that i could at least overfit the data i.e. using a very deep dense NN with stupid numbers of pars, or a very deep unrestricted tree, and of course a very lazy XGboost tree. In those cases in the case of the loss classification these models were able to overfit easily with obvious and terrible consequences for the test set (note because effectively we have a time series here the test set is fixed to be taken from the most recent purchases in a contiguous chunk).  


Perhaps unsurprisingly the best I managed in terms of generalisation to a test set was a RF which managed to get, on classification, about 60% precision and 40% recall which is certainly better than random given that, under the current definition, only about 20% of each of the groups (train/test) are labelled as losses.  So that is promising, but i'll come back to this. Also it's worth nothing that in this case the model definitely gets better on the test set if I exclude purchases where the carrier failed to charge what was quoted (i.e. undercharged) for some unknown reason.  


In terms of regression on the cost itself without binning into binary categories, it was quite poor across the board. Essentially the metric here was 'using predicted values did we move the average difference between quoted and actual towards zero and make the distribution narrower' and the answer is : no, it moved a bit but got smeared out a lot (for all models being considered).

So while the classification result is somewhat promising, the issues have been:

a.) I don't consider this sufficient accuracy to be actionable for what I want to do in terms of the business problem (which I understand i haven't discussed at all here and is clearly important, but at the moment this is a purely modeling/data question) and,  
b.) When deployed and monitored on real data the model was unable to reach this level of precision/recall on truly new data. This is of course concerning as it suggests something amiss overall, but it's also possible that the previous block of data is quite different to the new block, something i am currently investigating.  


I should note that the number of usable rows of this data is currently on the order of 10k.  


Apologies for the Tolstoy-esque post, I hope I didn't enrage too many data folk with it. Again, my goal with this post is to simply understand if I have proceeded in a reasonable fashion and that maybe this is the only signal in the data, or if I have totally missed the point or done this analysis incorrectly and there is more to be dug up. In parallel i have also tried to look at clustering the customer data and seeing if any clusters were more inclined to have 'losses' than others but nothing concrete there ( i am currently revisiting this though which is why there are no details here on it)

I hope you don't give me hate for being once more person to ask this question.

I am 28, I recently started a PhD in molecular biology, but I am slowly realising that it might not be the best idea to spend next 3 to 5 years doing it, esp. since I don't want to do a postdoc, and the field is quite specific.  
I have been contemplating switching over to programming (in Europe there is a huge demand, and for a junior position my background would not matter as much, and self-taught people are not uncommon).

Another option I am contemplating is data science. Some of my background would be a good starter (basics statistics are obviously used, PCA and ANOVA is used in genetics, I had an introduction to that; ML fitness landscapes is straight high throughput protein engineering \[or other way round, haha\]). I actually enjoy working with bigger data, and I have done some of it for my master (I analysed flow cytometer data, but not very well to be honest). I am still regretting not doing a master in bioinformatics, for lack of confidence. I would say my business mindset and awareness is pretty strong, since I have worked in a start-up for two years, so I am used to thinking about my work in terms of potential profitability and value creation.

I am not going to lie, one of the motivations is the good salary, especially after 2/3 years.

Question 1: What do you think about such career change?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to jump into this as I did with my PhD. I have been looking around, and found a part-time postgraduate course on Data Science, which includes a thesis work. This is the curriculum (translated from another language):

Problems of cloud-based architecture and cloud-based analytics and machine learning. Learning outcomes: code-based implementation of infrastructure, processing of input and stream data using Google Cloud. Basic techniques for the design of architecture using Google cloud

\- Business applications of Spark and Hadoop, their pros and cons.Learning outcomes: formulating algorithmic tasks using MapReduce paradigm, design and implement an application using Hadoop and Spark, analyse and interpret data with Spark and Hadoop

\- importance of Data Science in a commercial setting. Competences and tools for Data Science, management of data analytics process, reasoning and drawing conclusions based on data, types of analytical problems and models, experiment design and data presentation.

\- common mistakes in data presentation and visualisation. Cognitive mistakes in an organisation, countering manipulation, data mining in an organisation, legal and formal constraints of working with data, ethics of working with data

\- recommendation and personalisation of web services. Systems of recommendation. Learning to rank. Howtocollectdata about website users.

\- data analytics is a bank. Types of data accumulated by banks. Sources of external data. The architecture of Hadoop cluster using a real bank data. Examples of analysis using Hive/Spark. Techniques and examples of data visualisation (R Shiny), regulation concerning storage and processing of data of (potential)clients.

\- use of unstructured data sources in big enterprises. The architecture of information, the architecture of search systems. Natural language processing. Basics of business applications in enterprises. Knowledge management, information access portal, specialised search engine-based applications

\- SAS Viya, Server Cloud Analytics Services, Python for communication with CAS.

I just graduated with my Master's in Taxation this year, as I used to be an insurance auditor (very niche industry) and wanted to change careers to something way more mainstream that pays well yet still requires a lot of technical expertise, and my plan was to do tax compliance (prepare tax returns) for businesses. By accident, I learned about tax technology, which basically blends tax and data science to automate tax processes for clients. We use a lot of ETL tools such as Alteryx/PowerQuery, VBA, etc. and we also make custom-built apps for clients. My team mainly just does Alteryx/PQ/VBA and I'm apparently the only person on my team that knows VBA. The other team does all the custom-app development and most of the coding.

Anyway, as it turns out, even in a shit-tastic language such as VBA, I realized I really like coding. I taught myself C when I was 14, HTML when I was 12, but fell away from it because a ton of webmaster jobs were being outsourced to India at the time and I was unsure of the job security (obviously it wasn't an issue but 14 year olds are dumb, sue me). I love building something that will be used by a ton of users to make their lives easier. Doesn't feel quite as wholesome as say healthcare but still feel like what I do matters and it's fun. However, VBA is only like 10-15% of my job, and I'm not sure it will ever even be much more than 25-35%. I like playing around with data, and transforming it into something actionable, but I would love to get more into coding. The only way I see that happening is obviously if I learn some more languages, but I'm not sure if I would need additional education to get taken seriously. 

Realistically, would teaching myself Python/SQL/R on my own be sufficient, since I am currently gaining work experience in ETL and data transformation? Or would I need a second master's degree in CS or DS? Don't really feel like my Master's in Tax is a waste, as later on I do plan to semi-retire and just work for myself as a CPA doing taxes when I'm done with corporate, but I wish I knew about data science/analytics before I went back to school. Probably would have just done this to be honest with you.",3,1

I am now a data analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Aside from creating MS Power BI dashboards, I also do a lot of PHP scripting, database design, and I do full stack web development too.

I'm only making 62k/year at my current job. This is nowhere near what I want to be making, and the job is just sort of unfulfilling in general. I feel like I'm not using a lot of the skills I have as a person with a degree in computer science... Like basically anyone off the streets could take a month to learn SQL and accomplish most of what I do.

I figure I'd be more satisfied if I got a position as a data scientist or something similar. I've always been fascinated by machine learning, AI, neural networks etc. And big data seems to be where the money is at in computer science right now too, so I figure it might be the route to take (at least for now).

So now that I've got my bachelor's degree in computer science, I'm currently going to school for a master's degree in data science with a concentration in computational intelligence. I figure even if data science doesn't last, my bachelor's in computer science will still be enough to move into other things if I want to. And I'll be graduating with my Master's in December 2020, or earlier if I decide to take more classes faster. So it'll take a year and a half or less for that.

Does this sound like a smart route to take in today's world of computer science? I certainly didn't get a degree in CS to make only 62k/year like I do now (especially since I already have over 100k in student debt), and I need something more complex and fulfilling. And money obviously isn't everything, but I like money and likely won't be satisfied until I'm making at least double what I'm making now. Life ain't cheap these days, and neither are my hobbies. Lol. And lots of things interest me in CS, so I might as well just go where the money is.",12,1

Been meaning to write this post for a while. I'll be finishing my masters in Earth Science within a year and I've been perusing job listings to try to get a better sense of what's to come. I'm in a PhD focused program where I'm one of the few Masters students. We're treated equally and expected to output the same quality of original research, with the big difference being the amount of time we choose to spend in school, obviously with a PhD having a more prestigious degree and more academia-specific experience. If all goes well I'll have two publications come out of it: one based on Machine Learning and the other grounded in spatially variant geostatistical classifications of landslide hazard on for a large region in Alaska. 

In my time in grad school, I've come to love the tools and techniques I've been using much more than the topics covered within the Earth Science field itself. I'm really into understanding the nitty-gritty of Machine and Deep Learning, as well as some of the advanced statistical techniques I've been using. I've so far enjoyed problem solving using whatever techniques might be appropriate for getting the job done. Classic field geology has a rep for being very qualitative, but my work has is incredibly quantitative and data heavy. Nearly everything I do involves code, and I consider myself capable of creating, understanding, and ultimately visualizing multiple types of ML models, as well as discussing technical elements such as the capabilities of different feed forward ANN architectures, including their optimization algorithms. 

All this is to ask: what is the best way to convince an employer I have the skills necessary for a career in Data Science? Is there anything else I can brush up upon? My understanding of Data Scientists is that they have the hard skills, but are also able to think broadly about the problem they are trying to solve. My fear is the will look at my degree and think I am not qualified because I don't come from a CS or pure Math field. Ultimately, I'm looking for a career where I can do something similar to what I am doing now, but not exclusively in Earth Science. I love solving problems with big datasets and would like to continue to do so, preferably in a role where I have \*some \* intellectual freedom, i.e. not simply being an analyst. 

For those in the field, I would absolutely love some advice. Thank you so much.",1,1

Background: master degree in biostatistics from school of public health, have been working as an epidemiologist for over 4 years in a local government. My main work is managing the health department data repository and generating reports and insights for the health policy team. I mostly use Excel, Access, SAS, SQL server, Tableau, occasionally R.

Motivation: bored with government work and tired of the bureaucratic BS, need a career boost and some exciting work, also a salary bump.

Goal: data scientist /machine learning job in private sector, mainly interested health related industry like healthcare given my background, but I am open to all domains. 

What have I completed: Data Quest data scientist python path, took me about 6 months, love all the projects, but very introductory, especially in the machine learning part. 

Whats Next?

1. Should I complete the Data Quest data engineer path? Will it help? It seems pretty short and can help with big data.

2. I am planning to take the Andrew Ngs machine learning course and five deep learning courses next. But I heard they are pretty theoretical and difficult.

3. Should I start looking for a job now? Fee like I have the basic skills to start a entry level data scientist job that is not machine learning focused.

4. What do you think I should do next? Any recommended online courses?

Youshouldknow: I  use linkedin EasyApply feature to apply to jobs as well as manual  applying by filling up website forms. So far, as per my linkedin record,  I have applied to more than 700+ companies. I have used Hirist,Angles  List, nuevoo,glasdoor too with 100-200 applications, You can say I have  applied to nearly 1000+ companies so you can understand my eagerness.

Problem: I have received mostly no answers/going forward with other candidate.

Originally I was thinking that I could do a Bag of Words + Sentiment analysis to get some features, and then drop a clustering model onto the results to determine some categories. Is this a decent approach? Or have better text-centric approaches been developed that I'm missing?

I am curious to know about peoples opinions in data merging datasheets from different database sources in research/industry? Is is worth while to create a merged master flat-file and use it to derive spreadsheets to answer questions (i.e. if more data is added to the master flat-file, reproduce the study)? Or just answer questions based on data sets? 

I want to know what the common practice is for both? Personally, I think pulling data and merging data sets to maintain reproducible results is very important. What are your thoughts?

Im considering leaving my current job and looking for a job in the data science field starting in April 2020 and would appreciate guidance / feedback.

Background: I work for a Fortune 500 company in NYC and have been with the company for 11.5 years.  I started in their leadership development program and spent first 2/3s on business side before moving to IT in pursuit of my passion for data and analytics. On the business side I made a great reputation and built strong relationships by building tools to automate tasks, manage field groups, improve productivity and accounting of work among many other things.  I deviated from the traditional career path and chose to join IT ~ 3 years ago and led multiple reporting development teams before joining our internal tech startup as the analytics lead, where we deliver products using agile methodology and design thinking.  

The group Im currently in is growing rapidly but the IT organization as a whole is looking to reduce size and theyre offering a voluntary package to all IT employees with the terms that youd have to stay until end of March, 2020.  I love my current job and people I work with but would like to explore other industries, work on cutting edge technologies and solve new problems. 

Degree / Skills: I have a degree in mechanical engineering and am currently taking the Applied Data Science with Python Coursera course.  I made an [Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joseph.kastner6721#!/vizhome/JosephKastner-InteractiveResume/InteractiveDashboard?publish=yes) to list my skills that Ive acquired and continue to develop. Im also working on developing a portfolio of data science projects and have a plan to further develop my skills. 

Other Factors to Consider: I am the primary source of income and am married and have three children.  As for the package, I would have to accept it in November and once/if accepted its locked in. 

My questions are:

1) When should I begin applying for jobs?

2) What is the expected salary range for a data scientist in NJ / NYC are? 

3) What other credentials may be needed to land interviews / job?

4) Do most data scientist positions allow for working remotely at least one day per week?

5) What are some other factors I should consider / any guidance from anyone who has gone through something similar?  

Hope others can benefit from this discussion as well. 

Mods if this is not the right place for something like this please delete. 

Thanks in advance for feedback and guidance!",51,37

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ainsworth manages a team of 40 data scientists and engineers at Schroders, but he prefers not to use the term 'data scientist' due to its allureforpeople who've simply jumped upon the data science and machine learning bandwagon. ""We had a data science role, but when changed the title to 'data consultant' immediately all the people who just thought they wanted to work in data science and machine learning disappeared,"" said Ainsworth. ""Really good people see through to the role, past the title.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just some food for thought.

&amp;#x200B;

A debate on PhD yes vs PhD no would be one of those sterile how-long-is-a-piece-of-string type of questions, because you cannot generalise. But one thing I have noticed is that people with a very theoretical background tend to struggle to adapt to a business world in which it is often best to spend 1 hour to get 90% of the answer, as they'd rather spend 3 days to get the full answer. Which isn't to say that a PhD is useless, of course not - I just mean that PhD graduates must realise that the business world is very different from academia.

I'm working with a pre-established set of 12 cluster centroids in a classification problem, based on the output of a 42-element 2D joint histogram. When classifying points, these histograms are collapsed so that the classification is only done on a 3-element vector representing the mean quantities of the data point. 

The purpose of this is to identify cloud types, to feed into some of my cluster-specific analysis. Now, three adjacent cluster centroids all refer to the same cloud type, however they have different 'thicknesses'. In my final work, I'd like there to be just a single cluster to represent this type. 

My idea is to classify my datapoints with a codebook containing the three centroids (say, clusters 1, 2, and 3). After allocating all my points, I'd then merge the clusters together into a single classification. This would then result in a cluster which has been manually extended to capture points that wouldn't ordinarily be in it. 

Is this a problematic way of merging clusters, as opposed to say, taking the mean of the three cluster centroids? Or are there better ways of doing this?

And our global headquarters, you won't find more than three or four people whose job is to generate analytics and reporting. That's because nowadays, analytics have become so streamlined and easy to obtain that there are many software solutions that can generate analytics completely on their own. The days of us coming through a massive SQL database and transferring all that data into tableau or power bi or some other place to analyze that data by hand is long gone. You're not going to find dozens upon dozens of people combing through business data all over the place like they show you on various business blogs. 


In my very own department, they've tried to push the use of power bi heavily. We have this business intelligence tool, so there's this sinking feeling that we are letting it go to waste if we don't actually use it. So the managers have begun to use it inappropriately. they are analyzing email data of everyone on our team to understand who has the biggest workload. It's an absolutely silly endeavor. we are incorrectly using data to get the wrong information and make bad decisions. The problem with analyzing email data is that many of us schedule calls, instant message our stakeholders through Microsoft teams, and even meet with them face to face. some other members of our team don't spend as much time answering emails because they work on larger more complex problems that require additional time understand the problems. Think of them like projects. You don't see these in email. but our managers completely disregarded that fact in the endeavor to utilize data in order to supposedly make better decisions. However, because of analytics, they are now making very poor decisions. This is a net negative consequence avana Lenox. The misunderstanding of how to use it properly means bad decisions are made. 



and I try to think of a situation in which I would actually have to do some data analysis in a business setting, I can't think of one at all. The only reasons I would have to do any sort of data analysis are far too complex, and the questions are ones I wouldn't be able to answer. Only members of our data science team would be able to answer them. So in essence, meaningful analytics are now so complex that we need data scientists to conduct them as they are seasoned experts that got a PhD in one or another area of algorithms for data analysis or otherwise. the analyses that normal analysts like business analyst can do just isn't useful. It's stuff that regular old software can do already on its own. 



It is for these reasons I don't think data analysis is useful anymore.",18,0

This is my first post on Reddit so forgive any errors. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I am an undergraduate student currently finishing up on my bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics. I have been involved in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) lab at my university performing some tasks to assist PhD students with their research. I have really fell in love with NLP, as well as data science in general. I joined the lab in Fall 2018 and have since acquired co-authorship on an arXiv paper, have had a chance to be part of a bioinformatics research program over this past summer, and try to aim most in-class projects towards NLP/data science. My current cumulative GPA is a 3.47 (pursuing chemical engineering lowered my GPA by some), and my major GPA is a 3.77. Although I did not perform well as a chemical engineering students, after I transferred to the computer science department I feel that I have really excelled in my class work and genuinely enjoy computer/data science.  


**Entry Level Data Science Interview Inquiry:**

I have decided to apply for some entry level data science jobs that only require a bachelor's degree. I have taken some entry level software development/engineering and have seen there are a ton of resources out their in regard to preparing one for the inevitable coding interview. My gut feeling tells me data science 'coding' challenges/questions are going to be different than the what most resources for coding interviews provide. From what I can tell, there is little information on entry level data science type of interviews and ***was wondering if there are any specific topics/challenges I should go over or what to really expect from an entry level position interview.*** I really want to do well on these potential interviews as my interests align more with data science/NLP rather than software development/engineering positions.

Background: I have always had some data analysis as part of my job and I spent about a year in my last job doing actual data projects (i.e. writing SQL queries and building dashboards) part time. I talked to my current boss about doing the same in my role now and he was fine with it; once I have a better handle on Python, I'll try to build some cooler stuff and work on building up a Github. I'm currently going through Python courses on Data Camp and doing a Coursera course on Math for Machine Learning. My goal is to get a job in analytics of data science in the next 2-3 years. Popular opinion from coworkers past and present who have or do work as analysts or data scientists is that I could get a job in the field now with my experience, but I personally want a Master's, both for myself and to help my resume be more competitive. My BA is unrelated (English), though I have a stats class at a Master's level under my belt from when I started an MBA; hence the Data Camp / Coursera stuff in advance of applying to any programs.

Originally, I planned to do the Analytics route (I intend to apply to the Georgia Tech OMSA). From reading this sub, it seems that a lot more people have an MSCS. It seems like that might be a bit harder for me to get into, but if it's the better approach, I am happy to do some more classes in CS before applying.

I have about 100 different sensors all measuring different parts of the battery equipment and I have 30 second real time data for each of those sensors. I've already matched them all together creating a dataframe that is about 100 columns by 1000 rows, I'll probably need to import the data into a matrix rather than a dataframe for processing as I start getting more rows.

What I want to do is find anomalies within the different sensor data and then match those together to find out if there are consistent anomalies among multiple sensors (ie something is breaking and 10 sensors all show anomalies at the exact same time). 

Is there anyway to do this/would be be better to do PCA/dimensionality reduction first? There are quite a few sensors that are highly correlated, mostly due to coming off the exact same piece of equipment but measuring slightly different things. 


One example I've found is [datastream.io](https://github.com/MentatInnovations/datastream.io), but I believe I'd have to save the anomalies for each column and then find matches among different columns and I don't know how the anomalies are saved and whether it would be difficult to try to find consistent anomalies. It also doesn't help me figure out which columns/sensors are the most indicative of an anomaly, which I would like to have if possible.

Few caveats:

* As there are no Data Science ranking specifically I used a weighting of the University aggregate, their mathematics and their CS rankings (2:1:1).
* For some rankings it uses the average of a range (i.e. 150-200 = 175)
* Some Universities were above the ranking system (i.e. 500+) so I gave them 550. 
* I use the QS Top University Rankings:  [https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) 
* Cost is reflective of mostly 2020 prices, however if not available I used the 2019 cost.

I am currently a high school senior in Orange County who is extremely interested in data analysis and machine learning. I stumbled upon it about a year ago and have taken some courses through Codeacademy, EdX in association with UCSD, and have explored a few data sets off of Kaggle. I am preparing to do my Senior Project which requires me to shadow  someone in the field in order to graduate. Many people in my family are doctors, lawyers, or other professions that have no connections with data analysts. I have been searching and sending out emails to companies to no avail. I would be honored if anyone in this sub who is located in Orange County would be willing to take me as their shadow. I want to learn as much as possible about data analysis and how it is actually utilized in the real world. Since I have only been working on basic Kaggle data sets, I have an extremely beginner understanding of EDA and applying machine learning algorithms, so learning from a professional would open new doors on my path to becoming a better data analyst. If you think that you would be open to or you know someone who might be willing to take me as their shadow, please DM me. Also, if there are any subreddits or other resources that you know of that might help me find something I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I assume this post will be removed or put on hold as it is probably off topic, but I appreciate anyone who sees this before hand. Thanks!",2,3

I have a B.S. in Stats from a top university, but it was so long ago that its useless now.  I reside in the Silicon Valley, and relocating is not an option.  I am primarily looking into three areas:  adjunct teaching at a community college, software development, and Data Science.  All will require additional education.  The CC teacher route requires a masters.  For that, Id go for a masters in Stats or math at an online school, which would cost ~$12-$20k.  Software is nice in the sense that  education costs little or no money, if you self study at home, which is what Id plan on doing if I went that route.  Data Science sounds extremely interesting to me.  I realize its part math, part CS.  If DS is my target, and given my background, would I be better served getting a masters in Stats, or learning to code?  Or are both basically essential?  Id like to hedge my bets as much as possible.  For instance, if I spend over $10k on an online masters degree, with the idea of teaching, it would be nice if I could use said degree to get into another field, if I strike out trying to get a teaching job.  Likewise, does learning to code open doors not only in software development, but Data Science as well?  To an outsider such as myself, the career path into DS isnt so clearly defined.

As a result, SAS makes the most business sense for larger enterprises. I personally totally understand why this was the direction that leadership decided to take because of the level of customer support and even though I obviously would never use it on my own projects, it has its place in a corporate environment where regulations require vendors to provide some level of support for their tools , in this case SAS institute is the accountable party, and you pay for that support as opposed to the free open source. 

I just want to hear your thoughts because I think as a community we should still appreciate that SAS does play a role in the industry and corporate-scale data science is still a growing area of data science that we should support and foster, and turning students away from ever picking up SAS is a negative approach to take because it really depends on the person's own career interests and also the use cases and data environment they would work in. In an ideal world obviously open source makes the most sense but in a real corporate environment, I can resonate with why SAS would be the weapon of choice.",27,1

I've been following this community for quite some time and am looking for some career advice. Some background first:

I recently finished up my PhD in computational science, during which I was responsible for developing and implementing parallel numerical algorithms within a relatively large open source software. I wrote a ton of C++ code and managed to publish a handful of journal articles. However, given the scarcity and competitiveness of the faculty job market, I decided not to pursue academia and instead landed a position at a large, traditional company. The pay is decent and the work-life balance is great, but the actual work is mind-numbingly boring; I basically spend my days maintaining (fighting with) legacy software.

These days, I have been seriously thinking about starting my career over as a data scientist. It's always been an interest of mine (my BS is actually in statistics) and I have experience with some of the tools (e.g. R, Python and SQL) through internships and grad school, although I wouldn't consider myself an expert. I recognize that data science is a broad and technical subject and that there are no shortcuts to competence. However, I want to start making some nightly/weekend effort towards transitioning into this field + try to find out what subfields/industries pique my interest. The way I see it: if I don't end up making the jump, at least I will have learned something cool :)

My goal would be to land a data scientist role by this time next year (although please feel free to manage my expectations if I'm completely off-base here!). Some questions:

* Given my background, which resources would you recommend? I see Andrew Ng's course and Kaggle mentioned a lot, but do you think it would be worthwhile to try doing a data scientist fellowship instead of attempting to teach myself?
* To hiring managers, do you even interview 'self-taught' candidates? If so, what do you generally like to see on their resume? Would you recommend working on a lot of personal projects?
* Has anyone else been in a similar position (i.e. transitioned from an unrelated graduate field to data science)? I would love to hear your experience and advice!

Thanks :)",3,1

I asked some questions to the manager, just to understand more about his organization and the environment,

1. Any team members under him handle data transaction between their suppliers and his organization? (Answer: None)
2. Did they use any standardized test platform, proprietary or open source? (Answer: No, non-standard test platform)
3. How many team members, all product engineers? (Answer: close to 20, yes)
4. What tools they are using to do product analysis? (At this point, he didn't want to answer my questions, he then proceed to tell me his vision of automated production floor, importance of data visualization, etc)

Recently through work I was invited to attend a career day where 20 new bootcamp grads presented their capstone project. I went with the goal of possibly opening up my viewpoint on bootcamps, and here are ultimately my thoughts.

**There are some bootcamp people who have very advanced degrees, and are using it to bridge the gap between academia and industry.**

Out of 20 people, 3 had a M.S. and 2 had a PhD. I definitely noticed a more thorough approach in their capstone projects (i.e. carefully deciding on which models to use, understanding their data, understanding model outputs, and effortlessly conveying to the audience what their results produced.) These were definitely the strongest projects, and with their knowledge in academia plus skills like Python, AWS, etc. taught in the bootcamp will most likely land jobs.

** There seems to be a large disconnect between what Data Science is in a bootcamp and Data Science in real life. **

15/20 projects involved Computer Vision, Audio/Image Processing, or NLP. Nearly everyone used pre-trained deep neural nets and just applied their own datasets (often Kaggle sets) and nonsensically add/removed layers to fine tune their model results. Most of the presentations followed the format ""I took this pre trained neural net, fed it this data, and hey it did something cool!"" This is a very dangerous approach to DS, as:
* You will most likely not be doing deep learning after your bootcamp. This sets an unrealistic goal.
* Some fed their neural nets completely biased datasets, and it was clear that the results were biased as well and they did not realize this
* It was clear that some people did not understand how they work at all, and were just interested in the results and applications. This leads me to:

** The fundamentals of Machine Learning and Statistics seemed to be ignored **

Nearly all of the bachelors level presentations used extremely clean datasets from Kaggle and were essentially cookie cutter projects based off of each other. There was no discussion on understanding feature relationships, feature engineering, feature importance etc. Everyone jumped to the strongest models first (deep neural nets, XGBoost) without trying simpler ones to see if it would solve their question. 

All in all, I can see why bootcamps have their appeal (why do a 2 year MS or a 4-6 year PhD when I can land a job in 12 weeks?) and I do believe that they could land jobs in certain places. However in an environment where businesses are trying to solve unique and tough problems, a bootcamper may fail as they don't have the sound fundamentals as someone who has spent years studying the field of ML.",69,180

The company has high hopes for data science and predictive modeling but the implementation is going to bring it down and I feel totally helpless in preventing this from happening. My boss was apparently an analyst back in the day(like late 90s/early 00s) but struggles to use even basic tools such like Excel, and Google Sheets(I had to show him how to undo an action in Excel the other day for example).  This normally wouldnt be a problem since I do the heavy lifting and a team of analysts is there to help but he is creating a massive budget overrun by constantly bringing in expensive vendors to redundantly provide un-needed solutions. Weve signed several six figure contracts in the span of like three months, none of which I expect to add any real value and at least half of them are competing solutions to the same problem. Some his favorites are simply repackages of open source data, such as US Census and American Community Survey datasets. I express that we dont need all of this stuff to him and explain how we can use our existing resources to accomplish the same end but it goes totally ignored. Maybe he isnt capable of understanding it but its like he just wants to purchase licenses all day long. One thing is for sure, he is easily impressed by a salesman using data buzzwords and is ready to help them make the pitch to our executive team. He coaches them on it in fact. (No, Im not giving you his contact info lol) Most of the platform stuff is analogous to scikit learn and other open source ML/DL packages and the like but with a shiny GUI that Id rather not put between me and a giant dataset anyway. I dont think I need to put any names out there, but if youre a data scientist or engineer you probably get the idea. Think platforms and applications similar to DataRobot, Alteryx, etc... 

Its gotten to the point that I spend most of my time producing flat files for what he calls Proof of Concept demos but really might as well be called sales transactions as he has not rejected a vendor yet! At our last presentation, the vendor indicated that they work with our competition and could leverage that to provide insights for us. He loved this. It was totally over his head when I explained that it would be a bad idea to give them our entire customer profile dataset as they clearly are willing to leverage those insights with our competitors, just as they offered to do for us. He said that they probably like us more, as if they care about anything but the contract. Its tough to sit through.

I mean I can let him keep doing this and waste all of our funds while still largely completing my projects with classic python, sql, and jupyter(if and when the licensing agreements slow to a crawl) but its hard to sit idly through this catastrophe in the making. I mean sure if a tool is useful and makes my life easier, great but we dont need multiple solutions for that task and probably could have built our own solution more tailored to our needs anyway. Im worried that our department will become so over budget that downsizing will be the logical end result and we will be left with a shoestring team, all the tools in the world, but expectations that cannot be fulfilled. I am also fearful that he may try and find a way to throw me under the bus once a superior confronts this growing issue.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? Whats the best course of action here? Do you think I should just get out of dodge? Or maybe better yet, start a data science solution oriented company and send him a proposal? Lol.

I  am research master of economics student in one of the leading universities in Europe, during my bachelor I took two  courses about R and I have two short internship experience(each of them  was 2 months) and my responsibilities can be considered as 'data  analyst' who uses R. During the first year of the master I took three  econometrics courses in which we focused on linear regression, logistic  regression, time series and panel data. Hence, I believe that my  econometrics knowledge and background are good.

In the second year, I will take two data science courses in which we go through  Elements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical  Learning books, plus I will also take two micro-econometrics courses, one is theoretical and the other is applied.

So,  do you think that this background is enough for being data scientist? I  believe that I should experience more in the application aspect,  especially for coding. What should I do more in order to survive in the  industry? Do I need learn Python, my opinion is that improving my R skills will be more efficient than learning Python from knowing nothing, is this true?

4. Did all the aggregation and visuals within 15-20 mins. Pasted on power point
5. Presented to the boss - he's okay with it - he did ask, ""***but, on one of your slides, I've no idea what 50% there means***"", insinuating or hinting that he didn't know how I came up with the figure - but 5 mins passed, he said thanks and went off his way

I was somewhat disappointed with myself, but in any way, in retrospect, what ""I think"" I did wrong were:

* Not explaining those percentages on a footnote - those sort of questions can be handled by some mini footnotes I believe
* Not planning for a reactive strategy - I knew this was coming, I should have made some effort to make a ""data story"" out of the gathered data from the first week of data gathering

# What is [torchdata](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchdata)

I would like to present you a new open source PyTorch based project ([__torchdata__](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchdata/)) which extends capabilities of `torch.utils.data.Dataset` by bringing `map`, `cache` and other operations known from `tensorflow.data.Dataset` (and actually a little more than that).

### All that with a single line of code: `super().__init__()`

For more, check [documentation](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchdata/) or [github repository](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchdata).

# Functionalities Overview

* Use `map`, `apply`, `reduce` or `filter`
* `cache` data in RAM or on disk (even partial caching, say first `20%` RAM and the rest on disk)
* Full PyTorch's [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) and [`IterableDataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset&gt;) support (including [`torchvision`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html))
* General `torchdata.maps` like `Flatten` or `Select`
* Concrete `torchdata.datasets` designed for file reading and other general tasks

# Example

- Create image reading dataset 

        import torchdata
        import torchvision


        class Images(torchdata.Dataset): # Different inheritance
             def __init__(self, path: str):
                super().__init__() # This is the only change
            self.files = [file for file in pathlib.Path(path).glob(""*"")]

        def __getitem__(self, index):
            return Image.open(self.files[index])

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.files)

- `map` each element to `torch.Tensor` and `cache()` everything in memory:

        images = Images(""./data"").map(torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()).cache()

- concatenate with labels (another `torchdata.Dataset` instance) and iterate over:

        for data, label in images | labels:
            # Do whatever you want with your data

# Installation 

`pip` is the easiest of course:

        pip install torchdata

You can also use `nightly` releases (`torchdata-nightly`) or GPU/CPU Docker based images (check documentation). Hopefully `conda` will be released soon as well, stay tuned

BTW. You can also checkout [__torchfunc__](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchfunc), I plan to make a separate post about that in a week or so.

They both have 0 work experience , but MS in computer science.  I manage 8 people, but I feel the expectation my manager has on these two employees are unrealistic and they are being treated as full fledged data scientist, rather than the entry level data analyst positions they were hired for.   

&amp;#x200B;

**My Expectation of Entry level Analyst**

My expectation of two kids with 0 years experience but MS in CS would be that they would do some basic reporting, queries, and some basic atleryx workflows.  They would also be able to at times be able to do ad hoc trend analysis and communicate their findings. 

**Managers Expectations**

My manager is asking them to do what I consider ""moderately difficult modeling"" .  For example, ""look a like models"" and predictive analytics such as looking at the steps the customer has taken on a web page and predicting which of those customers that did not buy a product, are mostly likely to return and buy a product.

**Issue**

The reason I care about this is because I manage 8 people and the time I have to spend on these two employees assignments is almost the entirety of my week.  They have never pulled data in a work environment and are having to deal with a huge array of datasources and aggregating them, extremely dirty data, API Calls to just get to the data to even do their work.  Then these two kids with 0 experience with digital advertising or modeling in a work environment have to build out these predictive models.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Am I being too lenient in my expectations? Should I be expecting more?  Is my manager being unreasonable in his?

2.  If my manager is being unreasonable , how would you best communicate this?  I feel like the gap between his and my expectations is extremely large",8,0

Current career goal: Data analyst; informing public policy.

Background (all beginner level): Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS, STATA, Statistics/Econometrics, Linear Algebra/Calculus. I also plan to learn Tableau and/or Power BI before I graduate.

Experience: I've had a couple internships where I mainly prepared reports/summaries about legislation and policies, based on previously published literature/data. I'd say they developed my critical thinking, written communication skills, and gave me experience in the environment I'm interested in (public policy) - but no hands on experience with programming or data. I hope to land an internship with more programming, in the Spring semester. Other than that, I've done a few basic class projects with Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS, STATA, econometrics.

My thoughts: I would like to take 1-2 years off after graduation to gain real world experience, but if its unrealistic to be employed in my field with my skill-level, I might as well go straight into a Master's program where I'd study Applied Statistics with a concentration in Data Analysis. However, I was hoping to take time off to work and make sure this is a career path that I truly want.

For the seasoned data analysts out there:

1. With current my background, how likely is it that I'll get an entry level job, or at least a paid internship, in data analytics after graduation? Or are most data analyst jobs geared towards individuals with more experience/technical background than me?
2. Are there similar but more realistic positions I could apply for?

726,2019-9-22,2019,9,22,19,d7okd3,How do predictive models such as ANN differ against models such as graph models?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d7okd3/how_do_predictive_models_such_as_ann_differ/,runnersgo,1569147221,"Graph models as in models based on graph theory (e.g. nodes and edges). 

I'm trying to make sense on how models such as neural networks differ from a graph model, especially in a predictive sense.

In **ANN**: 

* 'features' are basically represented as some numbers, say 0-1 (e.g. width of height of some flower), or just some labels 
* these input values are fed through one or more hidden layers where these hidden layers have some activation functions (i.e. making linear values to non-linear) and send the output to an output layer. 
* depending on the applications, ANN can be either a classification or regression problem solving approach. 
* the more data you have, the better the accuracy.
* but overtraining the data can cause overfitting making the model inaccurate in a non-linear world.
* but ANN doesn't necessary need a ""relationship"" between the features.

In **graph models/ graph theory**:

* 'features' are basically represented as nodes and edges. 
* e.g. Stock value (a node) is impacted (an edge) by the negative sentiments coming from China (another node).
* as the network grows (i.e. more countries are added to the network), the distance between the nodes grows.
* assume: the further away a foreign country (i.e. a node) is to the US, the lesser impact it has to the US's economy.
* using some calculations, we can now make some reasonable forecasting i.e. to what degree a foreign country would impact the US economy based on the graph distance. 
* in a sense, large data are not needed as no training is required.

What I got from here:

**ANN**: 

* Needs large data.
* Overfitting may occur.
* Doesn't need a relationship between the features.

**Graph**:

* Doesn't need large data.
* May not have overfitting scenarios (not too sure about this one)
* Needs a relationship between the features (in a sense ...)

I'm not too sure really. Any views, input or others are so welcome!",2,0

This is useful in many cases but by definition is not creative, understanding creativity precisely as one step beyond the historical reality.

So: Netflix using it to know what to produce, YouTube using it to know what to show to users, or a fashion company using it to know what to design is something that essentially kills creativity.

To illustrate my point better, there's this quote by Steve Jobs:
""People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.""

I worked as a graduate research assistant my first year, then interned at a company over the summer. The internship was a bit disappointing; I felt like I wasn't a great fit, and the domain was pretty boring, but I still made the most of it. After the internship finished, they interviewed me for a full time role and converted me to a full time data scientist/statistical modeler. I don't feel like I deserve this role. I feel my manager embellished my internship ""accomplishments"" to the team I interviewed for because he knew the internship was disorganized/lackluster (interns from prior years also thought it wasn't great, so maybe he might look better if I converted to full time?) The interviews weren't even that technical/theoretical, focused mostly on behavioral questions. I accepted it because I knew it was an amazing opportunity.

I would much prefer to work part-time or remote. I commute 45 minutes+ each way, my days start at 6AM and I don't get home until 11 because of class. I feel like I'm going to burn out and either work (possibly get PIPed) or grad school would suffer.  I'm very grateful for this opportunity and am surrounded by brilliant well-experienced modelers/data scientists, but I'm just not happy. I've networked with other companies that would allow part-time/remote work, but for one company their tech stack  isn't as great (they use SAS, gross) and for the other, the work wouldn't be consistent (more project based), but I'd get more experience with the software engineering side. Those companies are much smaller but I feel like I'd have more opportunities to work on a variety of projects and make an impact rather than support older projects/models like I currently do. If I left my current company, I'd almost certainly be burning a bridge, and that's not a great start to my career.

I'd appreciate an objective perspective. I think the right thing to do is to stay with my current company and just suck it up until I finish my master's, but I'm very tempted to leave. If it means anything, I want to get more into the MLE/engineering side.",10,8

So, I know how to code but I wouldn't consider myself very good yet. In addition, I don't know the required math(calculus, linear algebra, statistics), which I know are huge. I think it is possible for me to get into stats, but definitely not at a super high level where calculus will be needed. I'm new to the field, as can be seen.

Since my only thing is some programming knowledge, could it be possible for me to do a science fair project with a modified version of this as my project? I'm curious whether this can be simplified down into something more basic, but can still somewhat do its job since I don't have enough knowledge to really take on the competition as a contender.

I work in a consulting firm where we from time to time do some data analysis on client firms internal data.

Industry standard is of course to deliver the analysis results in a mix of Excel/PPT.

However I find it a bit boring and also not always intuitive for clients to interpret. Especially since they usually not are data experienced themselves.

I mostly do descriptive statistics but in many different ways and with a lot of graphs and small calculations. I therefore tried Flexdashboard in R to compile a nice, and easy way to control the data behind the graphs in real time. It looks good. But unfortunately it's not that easy to deploy and send to clients. I don't really want them to install a lot of things in order to see the dashboard. I want to make it easier for them.

In terms of data compliance I probably would have to deliver files locally, and not have them in the cloud.

So my questions are:

* Is it ridiculous to use dashboards in these situations?
* If not - what framework could be used to make the delivery of the product as smooth as possible?

The car badge is a.k.a the car variant. For example: Toyota Corolla Levin SX, Toyota Corolla Levin ZR are two different badges of the same car.

The problem is that the badge field is almost always a text input box that users fill manually and that gives rise to some very mind-bogling entries too. There are a lot of entries where people have actually entered yes/no in the field and have left it blank too.

My data contains at least 1615 different car models and each model can have &gt;= 0 different badges. What I'm currently doing is to run the SQL query 'select DISTINCT badge from table where model_id = xxxx' in a loop and save the output in separate text files by model number. This gives me 1615 files that I will need to inspect individually as car models usually have no similarity between them.

After going through most of the files, I've realized that common errors are yes/no, blank fields, upper/lowercase mixtures, unnecessary hyphens (SRT-V has the same meaning as SRTV), 4WD and 4X4 being interchanged.

All of these errors can be fixed by Regex but, there are entries which may not look wrong but actually do not exist (like G6LPG).

To properly eliminate anomalies, I fear that I will have to go through every file and crosscheck every badge by doing a search on it to confirm how the manufacturer actually writes it. Is my fear correct or am I missing something stupidly simple that can make my task much shorter?",34,16

* It makes it much easier to understand the code, just by looking at the signature, i.e. the first line(s) of the function definition;
* It creates a documentation layer that can be checked with a type checker, i.e. if you change the implementation, but forget to change the types, the type checker will (hopefully) yell at you.

Of course, as is always the case with documentation and testing, its an investment: it costs you more time at the beginning, but saves you (and your co-worker) a lot in the long run.

*Note: Type hinting has also been ported to Python 2.7 (a.k.a Legacy Python). The functionality, however, requires comments to work. Furthermore, no one should be using Legacy Python in 2019: its less beautiful and only has a couple more months of updates before it stops receiving support of any kind.*  


The hello world of type hinting is

    # hello_world.py 
    def hello_world(name: str = 'Joe') -&gt; str:
         print(f'Hello {name}')

We have added two type hint elements here. The first one is `: str`  
 after name and the second one is `-&gt; str`  
 towards the end of the signature.

The syntax works as you would expect: were marking name to be of type `str`  
 and were specifying that the `hello_world`  
 function should output a `str`. If we use our function, it does what it says:  


    &gt; hello_world(name='Mark') 'Hello Mark'
    'Hello Mark'

Since Python remains a dynamically unchecked language, we can still shoot ourselves in the foot:

    &gt; hello_world(name=2) 
    'Hello 2'

Whats happening? Well, as I wrote in the introduction, *no type checking happens at runtime*.

So as long as the code doesnt raise an exception, things will continue to work fine.

What should you do with these type definitions then? Well, you need a type checker, or an IDE that reads and checks the types in your code (PyCharm, for example).

## Type checking your program

There are at least four major type checker implementations: [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), [Pyright](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright), [pyre](https://pyre-check.org/), and [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype):

* **Mypy** is actively developed by, among others, Guido van Rossum, Pythons creator.
* **Pyright** has been developed by Microsoft and integrates very well with their excellent Visual Studio Code;
* **Pyre** has been developed by Facebook with the goal to be fast (even though **mypy** recently got much faster);
* **Pytype** has been developed by Google and, besides checking the types as the others do, it can run type checks (and add annotations) on unannotated code.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I   am research master of economics student in one of the leading  universities in Europe, during my bachelor I took two  courses about R  and I have two short internship experience(each of them  was 2 months)  and my responsibilities can be considered as 'data  analyst' who uses R.  During the first year of the master I took three  econometrics courses  in which we focused on linear regression, logistic  regression, time  series and panel data. Hence, I believe that my  econometrics knowledge  and background are good.

In the  second year, I will take two data science courses in which we go through   Elements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical   Learning books, plus I will also take two micro-econometrics courses,  one is theoretical and the other is applied.

So,   do you think that this background is enough for being data scientist? I   believe that I should experience more in the application aspect,   especially for coding. What should I do more in order to survive in the   industry? Do I need learn Python, my opinion is that improving my R  skills will be more efficient than learning Python from knowing nothing,  is this true?

Your comments and suggestions are more than welcomed and very  valuable for me..

The purpose of performing model selection independently would be to reduce the analytical and experimental complexity for the first iteration of model development. Follow-up iterations could take the reduced set of features and perform feature selection jointly over both types of features that remain after independent feature selection

This of course could be tested empirically, but I don't have the time to do so at the moment. The only literature I found that discussed selecting categorical and continuous features independently was [here](https://perso.uclouvain.be/michel.verleysen/papers/kdir11gd.pdf), but it is discussed the context of hybrid feature selection.

My supervisor/manager has asked me to use the data we have to predict how an area  or a sector in an area will perform. We have a lot of 'shallow' financial and location data on a lot of businesses across most sectors (store sales, online sales, transaction values, transaction frequency and demographics being the main ones).

My concern is that since this is my first project relating even a bit to data science, I don't want to underperform as I plan to get a graduate job in data science. I have some knowledge of logistic regression KNN, DBSCAN etc but I want to apply it.

I know about the general methodology, have a clear goal, clean the data, build a model if necessary, evaluate and improve. Are there any things I should be particularly careful about considering the type of data I'm working with?

Should I be concerned about integrating with other datasets (eg. Unemployment)?",30,9

I am currently a ""data analyst"" working in a small finance operation, it is my first job out from university and I have been here a little over 2 years.

This is in the UK if that matters.

In that time I have developed my skills a bit and would say I know enough excel, SQL, PowerBI/Tableau to do my role effectively.

I am interested in the future in moving more into ""data science"" and as such have recently (&lt; 6 months) been working with Python, I would say whilst I am not close to being an expert I have a decent handle on it now and am at a stage where even if I don't know how to do something I can probably figure it out given some time.

For instance I have automated some very long processes within the business regarding data manipulation which is savings soooo many hours.  

I have used a fair amount of pandas, numpy and have seen a small amount of scikit/tensorflow/keras (this is what I am very interested in and have built a neural network to recognise digits 0-9 \[typical tutorial example I know!\]).

I like the fact that I can use some of the more advanced mathematics that I studied whilst at university.

The problem I am facing now is two things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it possible for me to transition over into ""data science"" with only a BSc in mathematics? 

I did achieve very high marks (&gt;90% avg overall) so I think that shows that I had the ability to carry on further to a   
masters/phd level but ultimately I chose not to (besides I did mainly study pure mathematics towards the end of   
my degree with less statistics so I'm not sure how much further education would have helped, I guess more linear   
algebra maybe?!?! I don' think I would have been looking at machine learning etc.). I feel this could be a massive   
drawback as I am not qualified for a   
data scientist role and I wondered if this will hold me back, ideally I would have a ""junior"" type role where I could   
learn a lot on the job. 

2. How do I go about achieving this?

Any advice from perhaps someone who has been in a similar position would be fantastic. 

So what do you guys/girls think?

PS: When I say data science, I am referring more to roles that would involve a whole team of people solving problems/ making recommendations using advanced techniques in machine learning (tensorflow, scikit-learn etc).

Of course I have no formal experience in this area and appreciate the terms are used all the time and mean different things depending on who you ask and has largely become a buzzword so please correct me if you feel I am wrong.",1,1

I'm working through the data science track through [Dataquest.io](https://Dataquest.io) and have been working on the Machine Learning section for the last two weeks. I'm learning the algorithms and working through the guided projects and it seems that I keep tuning the model parameters or features, calculate the resulting error, and do it all again without predicting anything.

I've worked on projects such as 'Predicting the Sale Price of Houses' and 'Predicting the Number of Bike Rentals"" and I assumed I would, at some point, be predicting the price of a house or predicting the number of bike rentals. But all the projects I do, and even the Intro to Machine Learning course on Kaggle, seem to leave off at calculating the MSE/RMSE and that's where it ends.

Also, the reason why I'm asking this here instead of one of the machine learning subs is to understand whether this is the role of the data scientist when it comes to machine learning. Is it your job to build and tune these models and the client is the one to use them to make predictions?

These are a few of the views I've developed as a result, and I'm curious to hear other takes on them:

* Peer to peer transactions of data-sets using block-chain: Any true large data-set can not be simply transferred to a third party by means of a block-chain. Any dataset you can move easily and quickly across a BC, is likely one that is not particularity useful. To take a basic example, the Yellow Taxi data-set is over 200Gb. There is no way to move that data-set in a peer-to-peer network.
* Block-chain. Over 11 years, no concrete use outside crypto has been developed for this. I've developed block-chain prototypes, and I still fail to see what advantage they afford to anything outside trading small digital assets. As soon as a BC meets the real-world, all it takes is someone lying to the block-chain to legitimize fraudulent transactions.
* Domain Specific Languages: A few startups I've seen have developed these languages to ""simplify"" the entire process of analysis. The issue with this though is that, with every level of abstraction, you also go down a level of dexterity. Data science is fundamentally a science, which means you will need flexible tools to deal with problems which are unexpected.
* Small data machine learning: Viewing machine learning as a panacea which can draw value out of any data-set.
* AI/ML + xyz is the end of pqr: The fallacy that ML methodologies will replace some job rather than augment the capacities of the person doing that job.",1,1

My job went well at first until recently that it got boring. 

What I've learned about myself was that although I'm hard-working - I hate manual tedious work. As you guys know, data analysts have to spend significant time cleaning data. 

The ""data cleaning"" part really didn't bother me at first. I enjoy coding and finding ways to automate things. I still enjoy writing an r/Python script for the first time. If I have to do a similar analysis, I can just modify the old code.

So that was how I survived the ""data cleaning"" part of my job. Until recently, our team expanded and now I have to work with people who don't code. Which means now I have to do a lot of analysis in Excel/SQL/PPT. 

I find Excel crushingly repetitive. Like you have to write SUMIFS 100 times while in Python it can just be a function. SQL is a little better, but still clunky and slow (although we are moving to a new cloud system so this part will be better). Plus I also have to deal with data that isn't in a database (i.e spreadsheets manually created by human that also require manual processing) 

So now I'm unsure I'm just bored with my job or bored with the clunky tools I have to use. Are most data analysts job like that? I thought about looking for roles where the data monkey work is less manual, I feel like quitting a job just because I hate the tools/infrastructure seems a bit too much.

One thing I'm having issues conceptualizing is how to model head-to-head matchups. 

For example, if the Lakers are playing the Celtics, could I just use a linear model to predict some a rating for each team, e.g.,

`lakers_rating ~ shooting + turnovers + rebounding + free_throw_rate`, 
&amp;nbsp;
`celtics_rating ~ shooting + turnovers + rebounding + free_throw_rate`, 
&amp;nbsp;

and then comparing the two ratings? Or maybe I could use a logistic regression and get a predicted probability of winning for each team? e.g.,

`lakers_prob_win ~ lakers_shooting + lakers_turnovers + lakers_rebounding + lakers_free_throw_rate`&amp;nbsp;
` + celtics_shooting_def + celtics_turnovers_forced + celtics_def_rebounding_ + celtics_ft_rate_allowed`?

This time I am trying to predict the probability that the ferry is late based on: time-series (by the minute) of traffic, the Trip endpoints, the vessel name, the day of the week, time of departure and our target: Delayed (0 or 1).

I am using a logistic regression and am worried about a few things, namely overfitting and having too many categorical dummies as my predictors.

For example my X consists of : 

1. All the dummies for [Trip Endpoints, Vessel Name, Day]. This results in a dataframe with 39 additional binary value columns.
2. A moving average of traffic for the departure time. 

Now as the post title implies, the competition requires me to predict the **probability** of a delay. I did a bit of general research last night that led me to the roc_aux_score and an ROC graph as a good benchmark for my model. 

My score began at .58 with solely my traffic SMA and I worked it up to .69 using all the above predictors. Now my question is can I use ROC score as a relevant metric? I am trying to predict probabilities here, not a binary outcome, which leaves me wondering how I can know what is a False Positive or False Negative? My second question is: if so few categorical fields return so many dummy columns, is using all of them unwise even if my roc score increases?",5,2

* A career in data science requires a thorough understanding of mathematics and statistics. At the heart of data science is machine learning, analytics, and statistical skills to draw meaningful insights.
* Some of the most commonly asked for skills in data scientist in 2019 are  **R, Python, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Scala, machine learning among others.** Data scientists are also skilled in the knowledge of different data mining techniques such as regression, clustering, decision trees and support vector machines.
* At its heart, data science is the art of analyzing petabytes and terabytes of data in a short span of time and extracting useful information from huge volumes of data. Over the years, data scientists have successfully created new fields of knowledge such as predictive analytics which is used extensively in manufacturing, retail, and healthcare and helps in streamlining operations and bringing down costs significantly.

https://i.redd.it/2mbm0uhc5oo31.png

**Some of the prerequisites in a data scientist** are  machine learning, backed by statistics, data analysis and in programming languages we have R and Python followed in SQL. So if you have a background in statistics and engineering, you are off to a wonderful start. However, you must brush up your machine learning skills because as a data scientist, you would be working primarily with ML libraries and data visualization libraries. Simply put, the job of the data scientist is to work on the analysis and modeling of data.

**However, besides technical skills, deep industry knowledge and problem-solving skills are definitely a must have.** You cannot find insights in real-life datasets if you are not asking the right questions. Finding patterns and insights is dependent on variables which are assigned by a data scientist. Data scientists are meant to resolve business problems by addressing the right problem that will yield the most value to enterprises.

**Some steps can be followed to take the road to data science:**

* The first step is to get good at statistics, if possible take up a crash course in statistics.
* While an advanced degree in computer science is usually preferred, it is not a must. Get hands on knowledge of programming skills in R, Scala and Python
* Learn Visualization tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI
* Understanding of Hadoop and Apache Spark is a must
* Learn the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms
* Learn the important tools of the trade  R programming, Python, SPSS, Apache Spark, SQL.",1,1

Been following the sub on and off for about a year now after having caught the general DS-bug that has been spreading in the academia and the industry.  I consider myself as an enthusiastic observer of data science rather than even a hobbyist, as my main academic focus is in economics.

Therefore, naturally, my critique comes from a social science viewpoint. What is the problem that you, as a data scientist, are trying to solve? 

The bandwagon effect does't seem to disappear anywhere from the schoolyard, it just masks itself better in the workplace. And this shouldn't come as news to you that these days everyone wants to do machine learning and neural networks. So just like in the schoolyard, suddenly everyone's in in the latest fad, but half of those only because everyone else is too and the new Air Maxes bought them a second in the spotlight during recess. The equivalent of this in the field of data science shouldn't need elaboration, but I dare to say that the ones in the back of the wagon are the most dangerous ones; as they themselves don't have a strong view of the bigger picture, they lend their skills to the agendas of those who do.

There's a paradigm in political economy, that the more things are (attempted to be) quantified to guide decision making, the more fascist the system becomes. Quantified Self is already a thing. Quantified Others is also a thing, as the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook/Trump campaign mess showed (facebook has on average 5000 data points on every american citizen - need I even mention this in this sub?). I worked in economics research for a while and my supervising professor had a paper where they applied machine learning (talk about the bandwagon effect) to figure out whether heart rate can predict economic decision making. 

So if you're concerned with predicting human behaviour in your daily DS tasks (as many of you are), what's the consequence? Knowing what people are likely to do is certainly valuable in a profit-maximising economy, but what about on a societal level? Should the government predict who benefits most from monetary incentives to attend university, based on family factors and other columns of data they have? It'd certainly make the invested money yield the most, so why not? 

To go back to the paradigm I presented earlier, the more we rely on this kind of quantified advice, the less the individual has room for movement and the more has been already decided for them. What if we found a gene that would be a strong predictor of impulsiveness and had that gene information of every citizen? We'd be fools for not taking this into account in health care policy and web shop algorithms, right? That companies probably already know the citizens better than the governments is troublesome because the companies are driven by profit, not by moral considerations (be it equality, wellbeing or individual freedom). 

I don't want to get into discussion about what if the models have bias and the siloing-up of worldviews following recommender algorithms. They are obvious problems that the field faces, but are secondary to moral considerations I present here.

I may appear as a warmongerer to some and seem to having omitted all the real opportunities the new science provides. I'm NOT saying there is no place for data science - I'd just like to hear from within the field what that place is perceived to be.",5,0

A little context - I've been working as an associate data scientist, finding ways to retain more users and deliver a better customer experience through our app. I've been feeling frustration that the work I do is mostly in the service of product managers that don't understand the data and misuse the insights we provide to game their KPIs. And at this point, I don't think it'll get any better even if I leave - All the companies feel the same. 

Is there hope for someone who wants to try working in a non-business setting, but doesn't want to fully devote himself to the statistical rigors of ML? I see myself as more of an analyst and less of an engineer - How can I apply those skills outside of a business context?

Hi all,

Long time dweller, first time poster on this sub. I recently graduated with an M.S. in applied statistics (undergrad B.S. in stats) and got hired at the company I interned/worked part time at the past two years while I finished up undergrad and grad school.

The position is pretty nice, and my role is basically being ""the"" analytics guy for a department within the company, so imagine building A LOT of dashboards/helping managers see how their business is doing and make decisions based on that. I already know that this job is going to require a pretty firm knowledge of SQL and relational databases, and using tools like tablaeu as well (not a lot of cool data science stuff...yet).

I'm definitely going to try and incorporate tools like Shiny R when I begin full time, but I was wondering if anyone on this sub had advice on how to really hit the ground running with my first full time job? I'm already anticipating staying late at the office learning SQL basics and working my chops with python and R (I did a good amount of programming with these in grad school, but it definitely isn't as intensive as a full time job will be).

Any resources you swear by? Any particular books/websites/online courses to take? Any tips on automating reports since we seem to be in the ""Excel Workbook/VBA"" stage in terms of our analytics?

Basically how do I become the best data analyst I can be so I can take care of more ""minor"" tasks that take an experienced data scientist 5 minutes instead of 5 hours so I can start focusing on the more challenging and interesting stuff? I know this job is a lot more of the 'data analyst' position, but I just need to know how I can eventually build myself to put myself in the best position to be a data scientist. It's a marathon, not a sprint...right?",3,1

* Ask upfront for expectations and future feedback
* Ask questions and state assumptions
* Put in the baseline for modeling
   * Data cleaning
   * Minimal feature selection
   * Impute missing values
   * Create a classification pipeline
   * Try training with a couple of sci-kit learn classifiers
   * Tune hyperparameters with grid-search
* Make your code readable
* Write Tests and Comments
* Summarize your thought process in under 500 words!

Also, make sure the company is not offering a technical screen as an alternative! I've found that it is literally **job discrimination and illegal** for a company to offer take-home assignments to some candidates and technical screens to others for the same job.

I am currently a ""data analyst"" working in a small finance operation, it is my first job out from university and I have been here a little over 2 years.

This is in the UK if that matters.

In that time I have developed my skills a bit and would say I know enough excel, SQL, PowerBI/Tableau to do my role effectively.

I am interested in the future in moving more into ""data science"" and as such have recently (&lt; 6 months) been working with Python, I would say whilst I am not close to being an expert I have a decent handle on it now and am at a stage where even if I don't know how to do something I can probably figure it out given some time.

For instance I have automated some very long processes within the business regarding data manipulation which is savings soooo many hours.

I have used a fair amount of pandas, numpy and have seen a small amount of scikit/tensorflow/keras (this is what I am very interested in and have built a neural network to recognise digits 0-9 \[typical tutorial example I know!\]).

I have also been exposing myself to jupyter notebooks and trying to learn some different ml algorithms (regression, KNN, SVM's etc).

I like the fact that I can use some of the more advanced mathematics that I studied whilst at university.

The problem I am facing now is two things:

1. Is it possible for me to transition over into ""data science"" with only a BSc in mathematics?

I did achieve very high marks (&gt;90% avg overall) so I think that shows that I had the ability to carry on further to a masters/phd level but ultimately I chose not to (besides I did mainly study pure mathematics towards the end of my degree with less statistics so I'm not sure how much further education would have helped, I guess more linear algebra maybe?!?! I don' think I would have been looking at machine learning etc.). I feel this could be a massive drawback as I am not qualified for a data scientist role and I wondered if this will hold me back, ideally I would have a ""junior"" type role where I could learn a lot on the job.

2. How do I go about achieving this?

Any advice from perhaps someone who has been in a similar position would be fantastic.

So what do you guys/girls think?

PS: When I say data science, I am referring more to roles that would involve a whole team of people solving problems/ making recommendations using advanced techniques in machine learning (tensorflow, scikit-learn etc).

Of course I have no formal experience in this area and appreciate the terms are used all the time and mean different things depending on who you ask and has largely become a buzzword so please correct me if you feel I am wrong.",1,1

As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and open-minded are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for. 

Hope my advice helps. Good luck!",62,495

## Day One :  

Download StackExchange data : [https://archive.org/details/stackexchange](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) .

You will need an RDBMS to handle the data, so the first day would look like this:

1- Install and configure MySQL. Import the dump into the database then read SQL basics. Spend some time doing simple exercises to get the hang of manipulating the data. Write a script that pulls, for example, set of questions about Python and SQL that have &gt;3 answers and the best answer is written by someone who has &gt;= 10 chose answers in either of those two topics. Observe performance issues.

2- Read about indexes in SQL. Hashing, sorting etc. Speed up the query from the bullet 2 so that it run instantaneously then write a class in Python that handles the queries for you. This will require you to learn about Python MySQL driver. As a result you need a tool that pulls required data from your database and presents it in a convenient format.

PS: I don't know about your background, but I think it's totally doable even for a beginner, all you need is some general experience with Python. (The code I provided in DayOne.py is just working on Windows. If you want to do it on OSX, you'll have to modify line 22 and line 47 to be MacOS paths.) After the first 2 steps, you will need to get familiar with reading data using pandas and manipulating numerical data with numpy. The documentation is quite voluminous, you don't need to read all of it, just be comfortable with importing CSV files, extracting and adding columns, merging two datasets and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

 

## Day Two :

While on the actual job you will often run queries on the whole database, it's important to get the gist of how to work with small data and still get meaningful results. Play around with pulling random subsamples and compare the distributions of, say, scores, with the ground truth - the distribution of all scores. Let's move further. You have a whole SE database in front of you, but stick to StackOverflow since it contains a lot of data. One exercise off the top of my head - build a timeline of languages popularity.

## Why is it so cool?

* How do you extract the questions about the languages and omit the ones related only to technology? (for example asking about Python syntax and not about how to mate Django with MongoDB).
* Lots of tags there, you need to visualize the results, so filter your sources wisely.
* You get to learn at least one visualization framework.
* Lots of cool pics.

Of course, once you did that example, there are many more interesting properties of your data that you should explore. Asking the right questions is a key ability.

You can see [https://github.com/benfred/github-analysis](https://github.com/benfred/github-analysis) .

&amp;#x200B;

\---------

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Day Three :

Data Scientist was named ""The sexiest job of 21st century"". You know what else is sexy? Graph theory.

How are the tags connected? Is it possible to build a technology map using just StackOverflow answers? What metrics would you choose to calculate the proximity of two tags? How would you visualize the graph? Have you tried Gephi?

Once you are done, the graph needs to be described. Thing is, the picture of a graph has poor value in terms of comprehensibility - you need to stare and stare at it before you know for sure what's going on.

So, you will need to learn about clustering algorithms (at least k-means and DBSCAN), K nearest neighbors. If you go full von Neumann on this task, some graph metrics and algorithms won't hurt. I suggest you try networkx and some parts of scikit-learn for this, they make everything much easier.

## Why is it so cool?

* You learn about different formats of data. CSV, Gephi, list of edges, etc..
* K-means is very useful algorithm that will serve you well in the future !!
* Discovering the meaningful groups is one of the most important tasks when you explore the data.

Distribute the workload as you prefer, I'd spend the first day tinkering with networkx and Gephi just because graphs, you know then I'd give to clustering, because there are going to be some non-trivial things like ""how the hell do I get vector representations for each tag that would preserve the distances between them?!""

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------

 

## Day Four:

OK, now you have general understanding of what's going on in your database. But you haven't touched the texts yet - word counts don't count .

So, today you need to read briefly about text analysis. For this step good ol' Latent Semantic Indexing would be enough, everything you need you will find in scikit-learn, also you will need to work with SQL. General pipeline you want to see:

* Select the data you will work with.
* Build text features with special extractors in scikit (TF-IDF Vectorizer is the best).
* Assign the labels for the text. Let's say for example that you want to predict how many point will the answer get based only on the text. So, you take a score as a label and the feature vector is TF-IDF.

It would be better to prepare several datasets in the numpy format, one for every hypothesis. I will give you a couple just to get you started:

* Predict the score of the answer.
* Classify the main topic of the answer (choose, say, 20 languages and sample answers about them).

Be sure that your datasets are clean and you know what's inside. This description might seem easy, it's not.

Hi everyone!

As someone who is a year or so into their analytics journey (somewhat), I've been meaning to go to some events and perhaps professional societies. I have accountant friends who are in that Charted Accountant club and lawyer friends who are in their Law Societies, but what about for data science? Any in Australia?

Best I can find is Statistical Society of Australia?

There is also the 'Data Science and AI Association of Australia' which has 116 people on Facebook and looks like its for uni students (their forum is basically 'How do I do this week 2 homework question'). There is also the 'Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia' but I'm not sure if they're active because the only event they mention on their website is something that happened almost two months ago.

There is also the 'Data Science Institute of Australia' which is even worse - the only event they mention is something back in April...

Any ideas? Or is this the sort of space where I say, 'Alright, I'm making my own'?",4,4

Graduated [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) physics (math minor) in 2013.  Did a senior thesis in computational physics, worked one summer research assistant job in computational physics.  Lots of experience in analyzing lab and simulation data in Excel/Matlab.

After 2013 - wasn't doing too well mentally for abit.  Was unemployed for 4 months, then got a data entry job in a hospital.  Have worked clerical/admin jobs in hospitals every since.  

2018 - I did a data science certificate program at a major University (almost done).  Also a few online courses in SQL, Tableau which are things I never used before.  I have completed 3 data analysis projects as part of the program, using Python heavily and some SQL.  

Skills: Excel, Python (strong).  Working knowledge of SQL.  Really good at math, sorta good at stats, know machine learning basics but still finishing up that course.

Does this background qualify me for any job in data science, or at least as a data analyst?  My biggest issue is the lack of work history and proper networking in the field.

I'm currently a freshman majoring in CS + Stat who is really interested in the field of data science.  
DS absolutely amazes me and I wish to work hard and make it into this field and contributing to the society.

Back in 2013, I took an official IQ test at UIUC.  
The result turned out to be 117, and back then I really did not have a care about my result.  
It was more like ""oh well cool I guess?""  
Even the researchers there told me that I do have an IQ that is 1 std above the average. However, the measuring of intelligence is very vague, so it may not be all that accurate.

About a year and a half ago, my friend introduced me to a prominent psychologist named Jordan Peterson.  
I consumed all of his contents, and sometimes I would find myself watching his videos for 6 hours straight. Since college has started, I no longer really watch his contents that much but there is one thing that bothers me.

There is one of his lecture which you can find on youtube called ""Occupation and IQ"" or something along with that nature.

It turns out as for most engineering field, IQ of 130 is minimum. As for data science, it turns out you need to have an IQ of 150 (3 std up above the average population).

The truth is that IQ is purely genetic (meaning you cannot improve your IQ and at best you can up about 2 points basis), and it is in fact a good way to measure your intelligence and success besides consciousness. That is why, as Peterson claimed that White and Asian Male in America tends to be more successful, and minorities have it a hard time to make a living.

This somewhat made me think if I should even try to become a data scientist.

Even software engineering needs an IQ of 130. 

Jordan Peterson said that there would be a slight variation and outliers but it is going to be much harder for IQ 117 to compete with IQ 150, especially in the field like data science.

However, the reason I'm posting here is that I feel like an IQ of 150 is a bit too high. I would understand if it is around IQ of 140 which is the average IQ for a physics professor. So that means data scientist are more intelligent than physics professor?

Hi all - As the title mentioned, I am working on building a model that can predict fantasy points scored in the National Football League (NFL) for a given player in a given week. To start off, I am working on gathering historical data that I can use to backtest my model. This consists of:

1. NFL players and the number of points they scored in a given week
2. The game spread and game total predicted by sportsbooks
3. Stats used to evaluate the matchups each player is in

As of now, I have only worked with one set of data (2018 season, week 17) for one position (quarterback). Before I scale the program for other weeks/positions, I was hoping to get some feedback. I will appreciate any and all feedback. Some of the things I have in mind are:

1. How are my function comments? Are they too specific or are they ok?
2. How is my code design? Can anything be done to make it more elegant/efficient? Would an OOP approach help and what might that look like?
3. Are my use of the pandas methods merge, concat, etc. efficient? I am thinking maybe those could be more efficient, in light of all of the renaming and dropping I did.
4. Anything and everything else!

A little bit about me - I am mostly self-taught, but have taken an intro to computer science class at a university. We got through OOP, but most of the OOP concepts are a bit of a head-scratcher for me haha.

I wanted to share my experience with yall, but totally fine if this needs to be deleted.

I had a technical phone interview a couple of days back with a big tech company for machine learning swe position. Interviews are hard to come by and I was really excited about this one. 

When it began, from the get go, I was struggling to understand what the interviewer was saying. It wasn't his English. It was bad audio quality (probably caused by echo in an empty room he was in) and his fast talking style, which made it difficult. I was literally leaning towards my phone which was on speaker,each time he spoke. I tried my best to repeat things which I didn't fully grasp (very frequently).

I didn't do well on the interview. It was my first, and felt I was rushing into answers coz he was talking so fast, and at times I zoned out thinking about how poorly it was going.

I am trying to change careers from a completely unrelated job and educational background into DS, and I am keen on going back to school if that is the most efficient path forward to meet my goals since I don't have any debt to my name.  I have changed jobs recently and started working for a ride share company while studying GRE material as well as DS related subjects in MOOCs, in order to see if I am serious about this. It seems like I am, and so I'm trying to dig deeper.  Should I put my money where my mouth is, and get a formal education?



Here is the more detailed version:


I have a bachelors in International Business that I received overseas in Japan at no cost, meaning I have no debt to speak of.

I have recently turned 30 and my only professional experience is working as a an administrative assistant / sales / everything for a small international startup in car parts manufacturing.  I was really a stopgap for the company as their first hire for this new US office, and the only fluently English speaking staff, and realized 2 years in at this job that I would not have luck transferring any of these soft skills in the future to another place. Tariffs also prompted them to open an office in Mexico as well simultaneously, with the goal being to put eventually plants in one or both of the locations if things work out. The work was tedious, my brain felt as if it was rotting away, and the culture was horrendous with so much overtime.  Although, seeing the seedy underbelly of manufacturing around the world was such an eye opening experience that I am happy to have been able to witness firsthand.  That is another story.  But the idea of people in our home company overseas emailing PDF documents back and fourth because they can't figure out Google Drive was the type of thing that drove me to the edge and made me question what I was doing there.  My boss, the only other employee, had never managed anyone before or lived in the US before, and my training was very minimal.  Granted, this was understood from the start at my interview (although I didn't realize the sheer extent of how ""kangaroo country"" it would be). It was definitely a learning experience which I love, but I didn't see a path forward here, nor with my current ""skillset"" of being able to understand someone tell me in Japanese to open the excel file he just emailed me because AirDrop functionality escapes him.  And so now I am driving for Uber, got a couple of great old friend roommates to help boost my spirits up and my ability to pay rent up, and I am plowing away at studies also to take the GRE soon.  I finally have decided I need to buckle down, learn some hard skills, and take my career somewhere that I WANT to go.  So I have also been working though MOOCs online for data science related topics, so Python and stats, although to be honest, it all seems a bit too light and/or unstructured.  I didn't have any of these classes in Japan during undergrad, nor in high school. It was very liberal arts. 

I have no qualms about going back to school, but i would like to know if a masters degree in Math or Statistics would be better than CS for getting a Data Analytics job (which would be my first job in the field, correct?).  Or should I keep studying on my own, and get a low level Data Analytics job, and THEN go back for a CS or Stats degree?  I feel like many people don't go back to school because they are already in debt, but in my case, I don't mind doing that.  I'd rather be in debt doing something I love with some disposable income too than where I have been for the past several years cleaning up everyones shit for pennies.  Its time for change.  Any advice?",13,2

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Searching for code to reuse, call into, or to see how others handle a problem is one of the most common tasks in a software developers day. However, search engines for code are often frustrating and never fully understand what we want, unlike regular web search engines. We started using modern machine learning techniques to improve code search but quickly realized that we were unable to measure our progress. Unlike natural language processing with [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmarks, there is no standard dataset suitable for code search evaluation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We collected a large dataset of functions with associated documentation written in Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby from open source projects on GitHub. We used our [TreeSitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) infrastructure for this effort, and were also releasing our [data preprocessing pipeline](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet/tree/master/function_parser) for others to use as a starting point in applying machine learning to code. While this data is not directly related to code search, its pairing of code with related natural language description is suitable to train models for this task. Its substantial size also makes it possible to apply high-capacity models based on modern [Transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html) architectures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our fully preprocessed CodeSearchNet Corpus is available for [download on Amazon S3](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet#downloading-data-from-s3), including:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Six million methods overall**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Two million of which have associated documentation (docstrings, JavaDoc, and more)**

This dataset looks something like this:

|Country ID|City ID|Movie ID|Date|Release Day|Seat Count|Seat Sold Count|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|1|1|2019-01-01|\-14|5000|500|
|1|1|1|2019-01-02|\-13|5000|300|
|1|1|1|2019-01-03|\-12|9000|700|

&amp;#x200B;

This example dataset describes three days of a movie pre-release (thus the negative release day), and it says that on the first day when showtimes were published 5000 seats were allocated to the movie and 500 seats were sold on that day. Next day there were still 5000 seats allocated and another 300 were sold, etc.

Release Day is normalised to represent the same period in the movie release window across all movies, i.e. release day 1 will always be Monday of the first isoWeek that contains the showtimes.

My dataset describes couple of thousand movies across different cities. My task is given 1 movie release identify other movie releases that behaved similar at the same point in time in the past.

Ideally, I am looking to do this in PostgreSQL, but it could be done outside of the database too.

What is the best way to find the most similar datasets where multiple variables are shared (country ID, city ID, release day) and other variables have varying scales (seat count, seat sold count)?",2,2

Your feedback is super important to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/daeypl/not_your_typical_industry_back_to_school_to/,itsnotmeoryou,1569671227,"This is a big decision for me to make and I feel that there is no better place for me to look for for some support than this community, so Im hoping youll bear with the length of this post and provide some solid feedback. From the older posts Ive reviewed where people were asking about pursuing a PhD, I didnt find any contexts that are similar to mine which is why I chose to write this post at length. There are several questions at the end of this post that Im looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, Ive been the only data scientist in the three different organizations Ive been employed at and havent had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isnt to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production) but, ultimately, I dont feel like Ive delivered much tangible value to the organizations Ive worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. Ive also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when Im really stuck.  

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts. It pains me to say Ive completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. Im totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research. 

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (beyond deep neural nets - pretty much all of the content in AIMA by Nerving and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. Im sure being jaded has something to do with it, but Ive become quite depressed at thought of the path Im on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do real data science, I dont like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. Im fine if it indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q1 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that Im passionate about

I would love to work for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company doing precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/). 

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but it would be nice if my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years pays off from a financial perspective. To be clear, Im interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that Im passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper science to advance that field.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* Ill need to work part-time (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fianc (she doesnt know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make &gt;= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the local university doesnt appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**  

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?

Academic:

* Am I able to find a research topic that really interests me or does the university faculty need to have expertise in the specific topic that Im interested in? E.g. if I wanted to do research in large-scale casual inference in genomics, does a faculty member need to already be doing research in this area?
* Is there such a thing as leveraging expertise from two different faculties / doing a PhD that spans multiple disciplines e.g. statistics and computer science? 
* What are some open research areas in AI that excite you and that will still be relevant in the next ten years? I want to future-proof my move in the best way that I can.
* Math is a weak point for me - Ill be taking some math courses in the CS BSc program but not sure if it will be enough for a grad program? Should I look at doing a minor in math instead of statistics or specialization in bioinformatics?

If you made it this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",1,1

Dear Sir/Madam,

Your position for a quantitative research intern is of great interest to me. I am a third-year physicist at Imperial College London with programming knowledge looking to gain experience in the data science industry. I am certain that with my skillset I can be a great addition to your team.

An internship at Impact Information Company has given me a glimpse into what a career in data science and quantitative research will entail. A large portion of my time was data wrangling which taught me how to handle unprocessed data and how to manipulate it to achieve the desired results. The unprocessed data was analysed further through web scraping and applying Natural Language Processing alongside a machine learning algorithm to fit our specific requirements. I then applied this data to automatically create Tableau workbooks for clients based on the specific data required by each client. Time series analysis was then conducted on data in postal districts across the UK to predict the growth of industries and how social investors can impact the growth in a positive manner. My skills showed great improvement and were indispensable to the company, so I was asked to continue working even after completing the internship.

Completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate has provided me with the skills needed to further flourish in data science. I can now build machine learning models such as KNN, k means clustering, logistic regression and evaluate their effectiveness as well as being able to refine the models to be able to achieve the highest accuracy for the relevant data. I can also apply extensive statistical analysis to the results to be able to determine how well it fits the desired outcome.

My background in a scientific environment alongside my enthusiasm for programming and data analysis make me a suitable candidate for this position. My experience will allow me to contribute to G Research while learning and gaining invaluable experience about the practical applications of quantitative analytics in the industry.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from you soon.

992,2019-9-30,2019,9,30,2,daxwf4,Mid career advice for an ML generalist: Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/daxwf4/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist_update/,maxmoo,1569776646,"[A few weeks ago I posted that I was having trouble with mid-senior level interviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/) Since then Ive changed a few things and had much better responses (3 onsite invitations and 2 offers). I've just signed an offer that Im pretty happy with, and wanted to update you on some of the things that I think helped the most.

# Company size

I was applying pretty randomly to a lot of different size companies, turns out my sweet spot seems to be startups with 10-20 employees who dont have an ML manager yet. (I don't have enough management experience to go for manager roles at larger companies). I think this is because Ive had too many experiences with bad managers that I dont really trust them, so I probably put out a prickly vibe in interviews that puts people off.

# Age(ism)

I do a lot better when interviewed by older people, like 40-50+, they seem to have more respect for my PhD and life experience rather than just trying to catch me out on something I dont know off the top of my head. Luckily the tech bubble (e.g. 20-year old founders of [juice startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/09/01/silicon-valleys-infamous-400-juicer-startup-is-shutting-down/)) is settling down, I think I read somewhere that most successful startups are actually founded by 40+ year olds, so hopefully the industry will go more back to the way it was in the 80s and 90s.

# Statistics

Ive never really got statistics on a deep level (my PhD is in pure math) so have always struggled with stats questions in interviews, e.g. there are two groups of users each one does a certain number of clicks per day, how do you know if one is more than the other. Stats just seemed like a random bag of z scores and t tests and I dont even really believe in p-values; Id remember enough to stumble my way thorough, and then say something about bootstrapping confidence intervals when I couldnt, but it made me come across as pretty weak. What turned it around for me was reading Rethinking Statistics: writing out the equations for statistical models gives me confidence when Im talking ( I come from a math background) and then I can just say that I would run Bayesian inference to get the coefficients. 

Ive also screwed up a few interviews with time series data from sensors (outlier detection etc) ... I still dont really know how to approach these. 

# ML models 

This was one of the biggest things I was doing wrong in retrospect. When I was asked tell me something youve done that youre proud of Id tell stories about powerful business results Id achieved using simple models like heuristics, logistic regression or random forests together with more organisational things like clarifying metrics and objective functions with stakeholders, product/design thinking, evolving data-labeling practices, and testing models in production as soon as possible. 

Lol turns out people dont want to hear about any of this, maybe it made them think that I just plug data into a black box and dont understand how it works? Anyway things turned around for me when I dropped all the business stuff and started just talking about (the one time) when I read a research paper, implemented the algorithm in PyTorch and got a meaningful gain in accuracy. 

# Engineering

You guys were right, I didn't need more engineering experience, I'm already pretty strong for a data scientist, I was just doubting myself due to my current company (which doesn't have a data science org) gaslighting me into taking a lower pay grade.

Anyway hope this is useful to some of you, definitely going to approach my next job search differently although maybe things will be different by then anyway and I might be going for more management-level roles. Have any of you had similar experiences?",25,224

994,2019-9-30,2019,9,30,5,db10qv,Should I quit my data science job in industry and go back to school at 30 to complete an undergrad degree and a PhD in AI?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/db10qv/should_i_quit_my_data_science_job_in_industry_and/,itsnotmeoryou,1569790216,"This is a big decision for me to make and I feel that there is no better place for me to look for for some support than this community, so Im hoping youll bear with the length of this post and provide some solid feedback. I've reviewed other similar posts re. going back to school to pursue a PhD, but did not find any with a similar context, which is why I chose to write this post at length. There are several questions at the end of this post that Im looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, Ive been the only data scientist in the three different organizations Ive been employed at and havent had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isnt to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production). Ultimately, I dont feel like Ive delivered much tangible value to the organizations Ive worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. Ive also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when Im really stuck.

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts and speaking with business stakeholders. It pains me to say Ive completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. Im totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research.

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (more agent-based models rather than DNNs, like the content in AIMA by Norvig and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. Im sure being jaded has something to do with it, but Ive become quite depressed at thought of the path Im on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do ""real"" data science, I dont like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. Im fine if my work indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q1 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that Im passionate about by 2028

I would love to work for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company doing precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/).

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but it would be nice if my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years pays off from a financial perspective. To be clear, Im interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that Im passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper science to advance that field. I feel going back to school will also help develop my critical thinking skills which I feel need work.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* Ill need to work part-time throughout this whole endeavour (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fianc (she doesnt know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make &gt;= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the nearest university (Western University, formerly UWO) doesnt appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?
* One of my biggest fears is that by the time Im done my PhD, technology will have advanced so much that either my expertise will become outdated or the problems will have already been solved. Is this a rational fear?

Academic:

* Am I able to find a research topic that really interests me or does the university faculty need to have expertise in the specific topic that Im interested in? E.g. if I wanted to do research in large-scale casual inference in genomics, does a faculty member need to already be doing research in this area?
* Is there such a thing as leveraging expertise from two different faculties / doing a PhD that spans multiple disciplines e.g. statistics and computer science?
* What are some open research areas in AI that excite you and that will still be relevant in the next ten years? I want to future-proof my move in the best way that I can.
* Math is a weak point for me - Ill be taking some math courses in the CS BSc program but not sure if it will be enough for a grad program? Should I look at doing a minor in math instead of statistics or specialization in bioinformatics?
* What are some interesting research areas in agent-based modelling?

A sincere thank you if you read this far.",1,2

I have very Important Question if someone please has the right answer cause it i need it in my examination  
Im readying about Date Warehousing and Olap I have read a text that i didn't exactly understand if someone can clear this point to me i will be thankful:  


In the following, we address the problem of finding granular temporal trends

in data warehouses by proposing two new OLAP operators, namely, Trend and

TrendAggregator. The first operator exploits the hierarchical structure of dimensions

in order to find trends of possibly aggregated data at some granularity

level. It allows users to use standard OLAP operations for retrieving time series

at the desired level of detail, as a mean to find trends that yield decision-making,

e.g., Display for each product, the positive trends in days for each quarter of

2013. The second operator allows users to further investigate the discovered

trends, represented by means of a multidimensional model. This operator aggregates

trends on the dimension hierarchies, e.g., Display for each city, the longest

trends between days of 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

there is 2 OLAP operator Trend and TrendAggregator: but i didn't understand the deference between them i have read the text and search about that but nothing. can anyone please tell me the deference and explain what is the deference between both examples:

1- Display for each product, the positive trends in days for each quarter of 2013.  
2-   Display for each city, the longest trends between days of 2013.
