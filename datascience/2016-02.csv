For my bachelorproject (thesis, however you want to call it) I want to do research into Twitter and the way their users treat privacy. Ideally, I'd like to look at the way users give away information (for example when their profiles reveal a lot of information, or if they tweet their geolocation a lot) and if it can be linked to certain groups (they're more likely to follow specific twitter accounts, they live in cities etc). I'm looking for datasets right now, but every Twitter dataset I can find pretty much only has location, tweet, username and date, and none of them have user profiles or what Twitter accounts the users follow other than the one their tweet is directed at.

Now, I am pretty new to datamining so I'm not sure if there's an easy way to link this data. If so, are there any pointers you could give? And in either case, do you know any Twitter datasets with info extending further than just single tweets?

Thanks in advance!

I'm currently in a physics PhD program with about 14-18 months left, give or take (I'd say 14 months minimum). I've already earned an M.S. and have had a couple years research experience, including a first author paper in a reputable journal. I have no interest in pursuing academia--my goal as a physicist is and always has been to end up in the private sector or perhaps in a national lab.

I enjoy what I do, but I am strongly considering making the switch to DS for a couple of reasons: a) it seems at least as interesting or even more interesting to me than physics does (I enjoy math, coding, and solving new/interesting problems), b) I am very turned off by the funding/proposal circle of life in science, c) the job market is better (both in terms of jobs available and locations that work for me), d) completing the PhD is becoming too great a burden on my life.

I hear lots of talk about how the Data Science field likes to pick up PhDs for their broad skill sets and overall problem solving skills, but I'm finding less information about the hireability of M.S. holders. Being as far down the line to a PhD as I am, I have pretty much the same skill set already as I would post-thesis--I will have just applied it to one or two more projects and then written up and defended them (and the work I've already done prior to now). My field is atomic physics &amp; quantum computing, so none of the main skills I would sharpen by completing the PhD (laser control, optics, hardware, etc) would be particularly applicable to DS anyhow, and I know that I'll need to work on things like Python/R/stats/Kaggle/etc on my own regardless (edit: for the record, I code well already but my language knowledge is based more in matlab/Igor/mathematica. My math game is strong.).

So my question is: would having a PhD make me substantially more hireable in DS, or provide me with a substantially greater starting salary, than I would otherwise be/have with my M.S. and present research experience? Although I like the idea of finishing since the work is enjoyable enough, the stingy grad student salary has gradually grown from an inconvenience to a serious burden on my life and my health. Also, due to some time limits that exist on my project funding, there is going to be a good chance that finishing will involve a sustained mad rush (which will also be detrimental to my life and health). I just feel like it's time for me to be working towards a career instead of towards another degree. Plus, finishing would require 100% focus on my research, whereas not finishing would allow me to spend 5-8 months right now on coding, Kaggle, networking, Udacity, etc while working part time in the lab as an extra hand for income's sake.

Thanks for any input.

**Edit: I should also ask about what kind of actual job descriptions might be open to PhDs that aren't to Masters.'  Some of the signal in the noise suggests that non-PhDs are generally doing analysis and visualizations and such, but are limited from taking on more research oriented positions (at least in the beginning).

If so can we also say that C is (roughly) twice as likely to occur with B rather than B? If this is the case, is there a statistical hypothesis test for this case? Or is this not statistically valid?

* Hometown
* Religion
* Political Views
* Work
* Sports
* Books
* Checkins
* Statuses, Comments, ...
* Language
* Games
* Education
* Interests
* Movies
* Music
*Facebook Groups they are member of
* ...

All of these (expect maybe some of them such as age,gender, ...) sometimes have multiple rows per user (For example user 333 knows 4 languages). 

I also have a variable likes. This is found in a dataset which contains a row for each liked page of a user. All of these datasets have a common **uid** key, which of course connects them. 

Some variables also contain categories. For example, likes have categories such as Athletes, Schools, Local Business

My task is to predict if a user will like a certain page or not, but I actually have a hard time figuring out how to achieve this. I am more used to working with simpler data sets with numerical/ financial data.

The data appears to be voter data. There is a voter's ID, a country label (there are five counties, 0-4), 10 features about the voter which have already been preprocessed into floats (e.g. 7.6587658, 1.2345645, -2.5172831, ....), and then a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote for the candidate in question. I have around 200,000 samples. 

At the moment, I have no a priori knowledge to think some of the 10 features are not relevant---each seems to be relevant, and cannot be dropped. 

I have been tasked to ""predict"" based on the features whether the user will vote ""yes"" or ""no"". 

Question (1): What is the correct approach to this classification problem to avoid overfitting? I could possibly determine which features are correct. It sounds like random forests is the correct approach, but how does one find which features are the most important? 

Question (2): I have a dozen voters with no county labeled. However, each voter has 10 features listed. Do I use the same approach above to ""predict"" which user is from which county (i.e. label 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)?

The following is a simple RScript where I'm simply trying to build a database handler using RJDBC and am following RJDBC's documentation to a T.

However I get the following error in the RStudio server console:

    Error in .jfindClass(as.character(driverClass)[1]) : class not found

Now I'm specifying **com.datastax.driver.jdbc.CassandraDriver** as the classPath, which is the first parameter in the JDBC method for RJDBC and this follows examples I've found online. Also, I have found that folks said to use **org.apache.cassandra2.cql.jdbc.CassandraDriver**, but that too did not work.

FWIW, I do have the DataStax JDBC driver and its dependencies in /home/hsatterwhite/lib, which is the correct path.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.

As a beginner just getting into data science, I'm seeing a TON of different tools, methods, and processes used for solving various problems.

Is there a ""best"" way to solve certain problems?

**For example,** I've been looking into natural language processing, and figured the first step was to get some data. Went online, looked up some movie transcripts on IMSDB.com. Great. But they're in HTML format and there's no download link. Okay, looked up how to retrieve and parse HTML. Got some people saying to use Javascript, some saying Python, and some saying R. Also got a ton of people saying ""DO NOT USE REGEX"". Alrighty. So where do I start? Do I just pick one programming language and go? Is there some unwritten rule that using Python is best in this case? Or is it just personal preference? How do I know I'm not using a language which was definitely *not* meant for HTML parsing?",4,8

Maybe it's just self doubt, but the entire team is full of stats or CS PhD's from Stanford, CMU, etc, and I'm just not sure if I will be able to cut it. Given that I'd be forced to move to a different state for this position, what would you suggest? Just aim for the stars and do your best (might get fired if not good enough)...or should I consider turning down the role and go back to being a statistician or senior analyst (another offer will be on the way from a nearby corporation in the next week or two).",11,3

I am curious what everyone knows or thinks about the data science landscape in Seattle.  We all know a lot of data science jobs are focused in the Bay Area, NYC, and Washington D.C. , but you don't see too much about Seattle other than it's one of the next best cities in the US for data science positions.

Specifically:

* **Which companies are desirable to work for?**  Bigger corporations like Microsoft/Amazon, or more medium/smaller sized?  This probably also depends on personal preference, but are there any places anyone would recommend looking?

* **Microsoft statistically hires the highest number of ""data scientist positions"" - can anyone chime in on what it's like working there in those positions?**

* **Is Amazon really that bad to work for?**  We've all read the articles about the ultra competitive culture, stack ranking employees, extremely long hours, and extremely quick burnout times, but does it extend to the analytical &amp; data science roles?

* **How saturated/competitive is it, and how difficult is to get a job relative to other major cities?**  I'm originally from Austin, and had to move to the Midwest for an analyst role after college due to market saturation, so I'm trying to be more mindful of it this time around.

I work with interesting data all day long. I just need to learn the tools to draw it out, shape it, and format it in order to show the company where the inherent inefficiencies in our current processes arise. I really have a passion for this. When I see our BAs slogging through excel lists manually collecting data, or UAT guys having trouble installing procdump on a thin client, I know there's room to improve with data. Ultimately, it's a great company, and there is quite a bit of upward mobility.

What advice do you have to get started?
Cheers

216,2016-2-16,2016,2,16,22,462e7h,CS is more important - understanding the maths isn't needed so much,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/462e7h/cs_is_more_important_understanding_the_maths_isnt/,__baxx__,1455628753,"
I'm a mature student, currently going through his first year of a CS course, considering moving to the  maths course, which would be a case of starting from year 1. 

*****

I'm not sure about the posts title - I was speaking to someone earlier who began their Phd Sept (2015), and they gave me that impression though. 

For example - looking at some of the material from their Bayesian Statistics module (and others) there were lots of math formula but they said understanding them wasn't so important, just knowing when to use the right one. Like having a tool kit - you don't need to know how the hammer and drill were made, just that you don't use a hammer to make a hole [1]. 

My motivation for this question is that I'm currently on the CS course (at the same university [2]) and I haven't so far found the course very good [3]. A lot of the content is (in my opinion) pretty useless and there is nothing maths related in the coming years. This is something that concerns me as I feel that having an understanding of Linear Algebra and other areas is important to go on to work in computational areas (which I **don't** currently have). But I'm not experienced - so I can't give any weight to this type of call. 

So I *might* be able to move to the maths course; most of my time this year has been spent learning  maths to get myself up to speed as I've not done much before. One of the [math] Professors has said that I might be able to move over, this is based on me working with her, and spending most of my free time in the maths department trying to get up to speed with things. I feel that by September I will be in a position to cope with the material ( I wouldn't do it else ). 

One of the reasons that I think the move to the maths course would be better is that the material is harder to obtain otherwise, where as the CS information and understanding seems as though it would be easier to obtain either in my own time or industry. 

I'll add that I really do enjoy maths. This isn't born out of some kind of feeling of obligation, hopefully it's a mixture of something that would be more beneficial to me going forward as well as more enjoyable. I expect it to be hard, but I can't see a problem with doing something that's hard (isn't that part of the fun sometimes?)

*****

So perhaps this is a vague question - I'd be interested to hear the thoughts and opinions of others though, and perhaps other questions that I should be asking. 

Cheers


*******

[1] I'll note that this is something that I often struggle with - where to draw the line with use and understanding. Like trig - I don't like to just use the identities but actually prove them to myself (probably not that rigorously) even though this isn't needed for the questions. 

[2] I'll note that the person who I spoke to is a friend, and I don't think that they're very au fait with maths in general. I don't think that they would know what to do with `d/dx x^2` for example,  though I didn't actually give him a maths test. However one could say ""*oh you just multiply by the power to the power minus one!*"", and then maybe he would say  ' oh right, cool'. But for me that wouldn't mean anything - why do that? First principles helps explain this and the idea of limits - maybe this level of understanding isn't needed though (even though to me it seems like it's scratching the minimum, idk though) 

[3] Much of the content is (for me) irrelevant, and spends two hours communicating very basic concepts. Example - if you want to have someone use a slider make it look like a slider one would see in a physical scenario (such as a volume slider). That was a two hour lecture for all sense and purpose.

It's  been pretty good, but I find some of the assignments a little dry, so in order to continue my learning on the side, I came up with a 'problem' to learn how to code functions, loops, and dabble in plotting.

Here's the scenario I am coding with real-life implications. I have a friend who has a gambling addiction. Somehow he is able to place bets on the NYC lotto. He loves to bet 'high ball odd-or-even'. Its ridiculous, because he wins. A LOT. I am trying to figure out if his method is sound statistically, or if he's just a luck-sack.

What he does is waits until there is a streak of 3 odd or even in a row. For example, the high ball is even (32, 28, 36) and he will place a small bet that it will be odd. He then doubles it if he is wrong and so-on.

What I have started to do is write a 'simulation' per se. I use the sample function to create a table of lotto pulls, then the 'rle' function to determine the rank of streaks. I am using the 'sapply' function along with the mod operator to determine if it is odd or even. I've plotted this in a simple scatterplot, and its basically exactly as I figured it would look from my limited statistics knowledge.

So, here's what I'd like to do, and I am looking for help figuring out the math to do, as I am not very adept with statistics...

Based on my friends' entry point to the lottery being at the streak of 3, given a small bet, what is the time it will take before he loses his shirt? The doubling up has to be a problem, and I figure with variance as it is, he will eventually hit a horrible streak  (in my sample lottos I saw rank streaks as high as 17!). I want to keep him from trouble here and I thought a good way to show this would be using data science.

I appreciate any help or candor. ",14,3

Basically I have some historic churn rates (which would be my prior) and some results stating how many were called/ not called and from that how many churned / did not churn.

I was wondering if this is better suited to a t-test or if I could run somewhat of a A/B test and comparing the posterior distribution to the historic prior?

I basically want to tell if there is a significant difference between calling and not calling  and if there is how much of a difference? what probability is there  that calling reduces churn by 5% etc


So far I have modelled my prior as a Beta(a,b) and ran a simulation to come up with a posterior

My normal routine for to implement a lot of parallel jobs on a cluster in R is something like:

    cl &lt;- makePSOCKcluster(c('node1', 'node2', 'node_n') # etc
    results &lt;- clusterApplyLB(cl, X = objects, function(object) {

I've done something similar in Python with the multiprocessing module, but I have yet to use a Python module which allows for connections to remote machines as easily as R's makePSOCKcluster function.

My question is this - for those of you doing parallel computation in Python and Scala across lots of machines, how are you doing it? Is there a similarly straightforward or even more straightforward implementation of this style of code in either Python or Scala?

Intuitively, it seems to me that it's fairly likely to have spurious results when using large numbers of features, but obviously that's not the case. Why isn't it? Is it that sample sizes tend to be huge compared to the feature space, and if so, then is there a way to determine how many instances required for given featurization?

I just posted this in /r/bigdata, but figured it could not hurt to post here as well. Sorry that I am new to big data. I will try to not be annoying. But I would really appreciate some help.

I am a senior Economics student and I have done my share of data analysis. However, all the datasets I have worked with thus far have been relatively small (thousands of observations or less). I recently came across a really interesting dataset that I want to use for an empirical paper I am writing for a class. The only issue is the initial dataset is around 8 million observations.

In R, I have subsetted it to just one year's worth of observations (2015), but that is still 2 million observations. I was planning on using a random sample of observations that my computer can handle as a holdout sample to test my model on, however, it seems that one of my variables has some incorrectly entered data. The class in R should be numeric (it's a price) however, class(variable) is returning factor. It appears that on some observations, there are random Ls which are causing the problem (if I run a quantitative function, say max(mydata$variable), it returns ""error: not meaningful for factors"" and shows a vector of observations that are causing the problem).

If this was a smaller dataset, I would just open the CSV file in Excel and find the observations that are causing the problem. However, with this dataset, Excel cannot even open the entire file, let alone command-f all 2 million observations. Excel has been my workhorse and not being able to use it really limits my options with my current toolbox. Since this is my first encounter with ""big data"" I am not really sure how to move forward. A couple options I see are importing the file into Access and chopping it up into smaller documents to individually analyze in Excel, but that seems a bit tedious. Obviously, I could open the CSV as a text file, but that seems like even more of a nightmare than the Access option.

How should I go about finding these observations and either fixing them or excluding them?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

P.S. I have some programming experience (enough to use R as a really advanced calculator), but I am not a huge Computer Science person. However, I do have some Computer Science friends as well as a good relationship with the Mathematics and Computer Science department at my university. So I do have some resources for help.",8,2

I took the plunge. Gizmodo showed an ad for discounted courses on data science (to $19) and I splurged.
https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/learn/#/

I was always fascinated with data mining websites as a hobby, and since this field is going to so white hot (if Davos Forum was right), I want in.

I think I have some edge - I'm a med school grad with computer science background. I deal with AngularJS, Python, SQLAlchemy, and Python backend everyday in my job in a lab informatics startup dealing with genetic information.

TL;DR:
1. I'm too cheap for getting certificates, and **I need to build my data science resume/exp**. Are competitions a good option (which ones are good)? How can I transition into the field? I would love to be in such position in my company but we don't have a separate department for such role (DS/ML) yet. This company has a bright future so I want to grow with it.

2. I want to start a business in HealthIT dealing with data science/Machine learning eventually. I know data science and machine learning is reaching buzzword status, so I don't quite know what exact needs the health industry needs. **What apparently needs are not met right now that, as a solo entrepreneur, start providing solutions for?**

Thank you so much in advance.

Those RFID chips are to be implanted into, among other things, every item that is to be sold from stores (Internet of Things - look it up for more info). This is to create an 'inventory system' so that all things can be tracked, monitored, and analyzed under the guise of eliminating waste through the United Nation's (one world government) 'sustainable development' initiative.

Soon there will be RFID Smart Meters located on highways, on people's homes, businesses, and basically everywhere. Therefore the RFID chips will make it so that there is no privacy whatsoever and people's locations are known at all times.

Data Sciencists (digital spies) are now the hottest job in the world. They get paid extremely well to develop new technologies that can sift through all the data that is collected from, among other things, internet searches that show who a person associates with, their political views, and personal interests. A person's phone can also provide tracking information on its own through triangulation but it can also give a person's location through where they ""checked in"" through social media. The RFID chip can do all these things and will soon be used as a form of digital cashless currency (cash will soon be abolished). Therefore, [i]they[/i] can know a person's thoughts or future actions before the person even makes them through predictive analytics (analyzation via statistics and probability based on past events the person has made). In addition to that, it has just been released that DARPA has found a way to utilize an implantable chip so that people can access the internet in real time with their minds. This will be sold as infinite wisdom and eternal life (uploading the mind to the internet) but it is nothing more than knowing all of a person's thoughts - making the mind an open book. The unfortunate thing is that soon it will be mandatory by law for everyone to have the RFID chip or its equivalent implanted into them.

The RFID chip will do nothing but ensure total slavery for the human race. People will be so blinded by the convenience that it can offer so they will take it unquestioningly. You will not be able to buy or sell without RFID or have any privacy.  Therefore, I feel that Data Science is an unethical career and people should boycott it and fight its technologies rather than sell out for a high paying career.

Our company is fairly small, so I ended up working on basically every facet of our analytics/data stack as we grew. After a year, I guess management thought I was doing a good job and gave me an unsolicited 10K raise (so 54k now). Since that point, I have been a large part of our data warehouse design and have designed/manage a critical data mart for our analytics team, including writing all the ETL, validation, and documentation myself. I have taught myself R and now use it to do some heavy duty reporting/automation, and also do ad-hoc analysis for various departments that nobody else knows how to approach. I'm probably one of 2-3 people in the company that really grok the relations between our legacy OLTP/current OLTP/ODS dbs, and if you include understanding and fulfilling the analytical needs of my team, I am the only one with my skill set. The entire time I have tried to continually research analytics tools, methods, and industry best practices and it is has paid off in terms of my knowledge and skills.
  
So, do I have grounds to ask for another raise this year? Based on my conversations with other DS people I could probably find a higher paying job with my skill set. I like my current job but I am wondering if they will balk at me asking for another raise when I was given a huge ~25% one a year ago. If I left, I don't think there is any question they would have a difficult time replacing me, and definitely not for 54k. But how much would be reasonable to ask for?   
  
If not that (or maybe in addition to), should I ask for a different job title? What I do barely resembles my job description. I am fairly young and obviously asking for the title of ""Data Scientist"" would be a little presumptuous, but what else is there? What is the professional terminology for ""data analyst++""? I want to get into more of the mathematical side of things (grad school?), so I would prefer to stay away from any sort of ""ETL developer"" tag. ",16,17

374,2016-2-29,2016,2,29,14,488ou0,Career/school advice for an undergraduate mathematics major?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/488ou0/careerschool_advice_for_an_undergraduate/,ResidentMario,1456724812,"Hey there,

I was wondering if I could solicit some advice on where to go with m interest in data science, given my background. The advice I have seen has been very contrarian: get a PhD, no, quit school and do Coursera instead, no actually it's safest to go for a Master's, etc. etc. etc. So I wanted to hear what you guys think.

I am an undergraduate in a business school in NYC, but flamed out of business and ended up majoring in mathematics. For a long time I was unsure of what I was going to do with that, until I discovered data science and data analytics; now that I know the feeling of being up 3 in the morning putting finishing touches on a project, I feel like I've finally found a passion.

* I am in my junior year, but have enough credits to potentially finish next semester (first term senior year) if I choose to do so.
* My coursework has been in Probability, Stochastic Processes, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Graph Theory, and Mathematical Analysis.
* I want to additionally take courses in Mathematical Statistics (mostly SAS), Combinatorics, Monte Carlo Analysis, and Fundamental Algorithms.
* I am now taking classes in Data Visualization (Python Bokeh and Tableau), Data Mining (SAS), and Databases (Access [bleh] and SQL).
* I want to additionally take a course in Data Warehousing.
* I have a workable programming background in Python, mostly self-taught and mostly in the last few months.
* I have only taken Business Stats I. I am reading a I/II textbook now, but the undergraduate statistics courses here are very thin and very business, and I'm the kind of guy that...tries to reprove everything in the textbook.
* I have a [decent blog](http://www.residentmar.io/2016/02/20/wikimedia-foundation-turnover.html).
* I'm trying to start a Kaggle competition team at my school.
* I've recently started going to data-themed [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/) in the NYC area. I feel like I'm always almost the youngest person in the crowd---it can be very unnerving.

Given my position, I feel like I have a few choices:

* Focus on my classes and apply for PhD programs in theoretical CS or in stats/applied stats. (but do I really want to never leave school?)
* Focus on my classes and sweet talk the professors here into letting me take graduate statistics classes. Apply to master's programs in data analytics/applied statistics. (but do I really want to hit the job market with a ton of debt?)
* Forget about classes, graduate a semester early, go crazy on Coursera, network like crazy, try to get a job out of undergrad. (but will I have the experience to get a job at all?)

I see people that have gotten very far into their chosen field because they made their decision almost from the start of school, whilst I feel like I am getting into this game very late. What, in your opinion, is my best option?",0,4

I am currently a high school mathematics teacher with a masters degree looking to move to the data science field.  I have seen many free and expensive courses online and would like to know your recommendations.  I think doing it all on my own is too difficult because I would struggle coming up with project ideas.  Also, I frankly do not know where to start.  I am a math teacher so I obviously cannot afford the courses that are close to 14000.  Thanks for the advice!  ",11,0
