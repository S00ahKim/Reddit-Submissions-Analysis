however, even though the bosses say that they'll spare no expense in this endeavor, some of the meetings have shown us existing enterprise-level big data analytics reporting tools, and it has been implied that this is what they want us to make. 

i am not really a big fan of re-inventing the wheel, and this is not what i signed on for.  i want to get into the data as soon as possible, and i'm sure the head honchos could be convinced by some powerful free software which could produce some nice reports for the business-folk. 

[i'm guessing there are probably some obvious examples out there, and i might get a few ""lmgtfy"" responses, but i'm attempting to crowd-source from those here who have experience in the field.] 



**tl;dr**: we need a free, preferably open source analytics reporting tool that will interface with big data sources (namely Hadoop).  if the tool has any kind of python scripting interface, that would be a big bonus as well",0,1
