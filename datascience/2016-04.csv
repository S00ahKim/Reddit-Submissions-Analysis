I'm a math major in undergrad and I'm very interested in becoming a Data Scientist.  I've tried to create a curriculum well rounded in math, statistics and computer science, all revolving around working in data science.  That being said, I'd like your feedback on the classes I'll be taking, that is, whether there are classes I need or classes I don't need to be taking.  Thanks!

Math Classes: Calc I, II and Vector/Multivariable, Linear Algebra, Algebraic Structures I, Analysis I and II, Discrete Math I and II (only class with combinatorials other than Combinatorial Game Theory) , General Topography and Numerical Analysis.  

Statistics:  Stat for Engineers (prereq for Comp Sci), Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Statistical Theory, Statistical Methods II, Forecasting and Time Series, Applied Stochastic Processes, Computing in Statistics (R and SAS), Advanced SAS Programming, Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis, Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs, and Big Data.

Computer Science: Algorithmic Design I and II (required Java classes), Digital Logic Design, Introduction to Software Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Design, Computational Science (mainly parallel algorithms), Visualization tools, and Artificial Intelligence.

Ideally I'd replace some of those introductory computer sciences, but they're mostly prerequisites for the others.  I'm mainly worried that there are more maths I should be taking. The other semi-relevant maths my school offers are Ordinary Diff Eq, Nonlinear Optimization, Discrete Optimization, Algebraic Structures II, Vector Analysis, and Applied Complex Variables.  I'd probably have to replace some other classes to fit any of those.  We also have some theoretical classes like Algebraic Coding Theory and Number Theory, but I doubt those are things I'd need in undergrad if at all.

Thanks!

In addition to being fun, Kaggle allows you to get real world experience in the types of methods needed to solve real world problems. You get instant feedback on how well you did on a problem, and can quickly learn how experts approach the problem. In addition you get to participate in a solid community of very smart and hard-working people who are experts in their field.

While it is true that the techniques needed to win a competition are more advanced than you will likely ever need to know, you will gain practical experience with a lot of fundamentals. Every supervised learning technique will involve cross validation for example. You will learn about overfitting and feature engineering as applied to real world problems. If you ever want to invest a lot of time you will learn the power of ensembling. You also won't need to waste time learning things with limited practical utility as you would at a data science course, like how to build a neural network from scratch.

I see way too many posts about how Kaggle solutions are overly complicated and not realistic. While this is true, it is not relevant. The vast majority of people will never come close to winning a competition so will not need to build monster ensembles. Starting your own side-project is a great alternative, but it is much harder to do this in practice.",15,6

I understand that if this idea were to become in full use it would require a massive amount of data and computing processes, but I'm not concerned with that right now.

However my question is simply if the cookie data and other data that marketers use to determine your side bar ads for example, are available to the public?  Or if those are only retrieved per device use by a website (or Google, then sold to the marketing companies) and used in conjunction with subsequent searches and web page visits.

My particular application would require an external use, analysis and redirect of information that was not returned to the user, but in an essence simply mining the data and using it to study trends among a society.

This field really caught my eye when I began reading about it. I think I have the right kind of mind for it...I enjoy looking at and manipulating data in Excel. I actually got excited when I taught myself to use pivot tables. I like researching data for my job and presenting it in a way that is more digestible for my superiors. I use a database at work to keep track of constituent correspondence, though my usage is mostly just data entry and using it to output responses.

Here is the thing: I have very little programming experience (my knowledge is basically HTML and CSS that I learned in college) and my statistical side has yet to be tested. Mathematically speaking, I am average.  If I were to explore this field, I would have no idea where to start. 

The good news is, I am young (just shy of 24) and willing to learn new things. Though I am no programmer, I consider myself computer savvy and adaptable. My job offers me 1/2 tuition reimbursement, so I am willing to go back to school. I found an online program for both a graduate certificate in data science, and a MS in data science (with two tracks - a technical, and a ""decision maker"") at [Indiana University](https://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/).

The water we drink and the air we breathe are obviously essential for living and health.  Interestingly, cross-city and cross-time drinking water contaminant data is super hard to get, while the air data is already in good shape compared to water data.  Meanwhile, drinking water contaminant levels are already being measured and published annually at the municipal level by cities across the USA.  Thats a great thing.  But heres the problem: This city-level water data just seems to get lost after the cities measure the water contaminants and deliver the paper printouts to residents.  The accumulated city data from each year, never quite all gets together into a combined, complete dataset, from across all the years of measurements, and from across all the cities, and in uniform data formats, and without gaps in the data, in an electronic format suitable for machine reading.  The citys water report is on paper, or a PDF file.

So our water has a data problem.  Because of our data problem with water, our citizens really cant very effectively analyze our water data yet.  Without good data, we cant see water trends, and we cant see many problems that might already be presenting.  Our water operation is like driving blind.  What happens when you cant see well is obvious.  So we react, but too late.  Flint, Michigan is a sad story.  We need to get more in front of the upcoming problems in our water. Doing a better job of seeing our water data is a necessary step for avoidance of further water accidents, if you would consider this situation as an analogy to driving a car.

So lets try to get our water data up to the level of our air data.  The downside is, that if we fail to up our game for the water data, then the public across the USA, if I had to guess, could sadly suffer additional nasty surprises such as Flint Michigan already did. Its partly a matter of not seeing in time. We could avoid some water problems if we could see some of these water problems.  We are not seeing our water problems.  We need to use computers to help us analyze this data better.  Its there if we look at it, but with water we have not looked at it until after the fact, after the big accident.  It does not have to be this way.  Sadly, if I had to guess, more such surprises are undoubtedly in store for Americans in unlucky cities and towns as long we dont really try hard to get better at organizing and sharing our drinking water data coming from all the cities across the USA, every year, from all our local point sources of water contaminant measurements. We need to do what it takes to really look at our water data better.

Fortunately, our air pollution situation can show us the way forward in this regard.  See, on the one hand, the states across the USA actually have by and large made some substantial improvements in air pollution monitoring, and furthermore they have actually enjoyed some improved air pollution levels over the past decades.  

Small-particle (PM2.5) air pollution levels for a couple of decades now, have been sensed, measured, and recorded on a schedule, at city-level point collections across the entire USA. Those air pollutant data are recorded and stored uniformly in machine readable formats, collected together, and routinely disbursed back to the public, at a national level, and today this data distribution mechanism for air pollution sensors already includes rapid downloading and highly available access to this entire air pollutant dataset by any citizens with a computer, by downloading the air pollution dataset from the internet using a .gov web site.

By contrast, however, the drinking water contaminant recording and reporting framework, unfortunately, is lagging and unsatisfactory by comparison.  Even though the water we drink is equally as essential as the air we breathe, this same level of collected and organized data on the drinking water contaminant levels is just not there.  For water, there is just no way to get access today to the complete dataset. There is for now at least no way to do what we do with air pollution already, which is to analyze the levels of contaminants that are being recorded both across time, as well as across the point sources, the cities, and the states.  

Its a shame -- and heres the opportunity -- because the water data is already largely being both measured and recorded by municipalities at least once every year, as so-called Safe Drinking Water Act: Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR).  The CCR is a start, its one step, but its not the goal post. CCR is not there yet at the goal line. So obviously the problem is not that the data arent being collected, because they are being collected in the water contaminant levels published locally in CCR reports in every city in the USA. Somehow, though, this CCR water data is not going all the way to the goal. It is not getting where it needs to go to win this game, not really a game at all, essential for life, its the water we drink.  The CCR water data is not yet in the machine readable format it needs to be in for analysis on computers.  CCR water data just sits on paper printouts delivered in mailboxes in the towns that produce them, and it sits in PDF files on a town computer, which is not good enough to win this game (not a game at all).  CCR data needs to be also provided in machine readable format if we want to see past trends, never mind what lies ahead, and this data needs to be a complete map of water data, not just one towns data, the whole map of the USA is what we need to see. We need to see trends in time.  We need to see what town is close to what other town, both at the pollutant levels as well as geographically.  Looking at a paper CCR report from the city is good but its a baby step. We need to run with this ball now. We have the ball in our possession. We need to run with it. We can put our computers onto this data but not today because the powerful computers cant see this one PDF file sitting on a computer disk in a box in City Hall. My computer is powerful but it still cant open cardboard boxes. 

We need water data collected together from all the cities and all the years, we need it posted to one web site thats always online, we need it in a CSV format.  We need uniformity. We need comprehensive collections.  We need to move away from scattershot data sharing by the limited set of heroic cities who are feeling the volunteerism and sharing this data outside of their own locality.  We need all these cities data, on time, every time, not in a cardboard box in a government office, but on a website in a CSV machine readable file for download around the clock.

Our drinking water data situation today is a bit like its being dropped on the floor by the cities and the states, after they did so much good work to get the water measured and sent to all the local residents in the first place.  Its a shame we are just dropping the ball here for our drinking water data. Its not like the cities are not trying, because they are trying. Cities are producing the CCR water reports, and they are delivering them on paper to peoples mailboxes, which is good, but like I said its not enough to avert some kinds of accidents. Cities of course dont know what to do next to get this data to the next level.  They would if they could, but they just dont know.  Cities need our help knowing what to do next, how to share data, how to analyze to see trends in our water data. Cities barely manage as it is. There are trends in the water data, if someone would just look at them. Cities are not equipped to handle this to take this water data to the next level. Its OK because there are only enough city workers to keep up with one citys needs. Thats all they can do really.  Another cross-city entity needs to step in when multiple cities need to combine their data, and thats the state, or thats the .gov web site. Id say all states need to do this in a uniform manner and this is just not going to happen at individual states for the same reason it didnt happen at individual cities. The scope of responsibility for cross-state efforts cannot be just one state at a time.

The cities just dont know that they need to collect all the different cities data together into one big dataset.  Its understandable.  And thats not what cities are good at, collecting each others data.  The states and the USA needs to collect this water data together and keep it all, not summarize anything. They need to keep all the raw sensor data, keep all the time series data, keep all the different point sources.  Complete, organized, tidy, but unsummarized raw data is what we need to provide to the citizens, so anyone who has a job duty or even just a knack for this kind of analysis, can just go ahead and analyze our water data.  We need to get it from all the cities, and the natural grouping of all cities in the USA is the federal level. So the federal web site needs to be the one to let us download this water dataset from their website, whenever we want it without restrictions.  We really need immediate, free download of water data from all the cities.  It is just like we already have for air data.

The good thing is, we can do for water what we are already doing for air.  It doesnt take a great scientific invention or a lot of time wasted looking for new answers, because we could do the same thing we are already doing with our air data, as I have detailed.  The water data is already being collected by cities and drinking water authorities across the USA but then it just sits there somewhere on a printout on paper in a file cabinet, where few can practically access this data all together, clean, up to date, in machine readable format like a CSV file, accessible right now on the .gov website for download.  Thats what needs to happen. Because today we have our heads down in terms of water quality, because we not looking at the road ahead. Its not that hard. We just have to properly tidy it up, gather it, and publish our complete dataset of water data which we already have, to an electronic website where the public can just go get it.

Current Impediments Due Mainly to Absence of Federal Requirements for Water Contaminant Data Collection and Data Sharing:

- Municipalities not up-reporting existing annual point data measurements to state and federal governments, on a schedule, without omissions.

- Not storing data and publishing data in machine readable data formats.
Nonuniformity of data coding and recording.

- Excessive censoring of data, such as for nondetects.

- Excessive use of assumptions, such as for estimating time series parameters.

- Excessive time gaps between measurements and recordings.

- State and federal governments not electronically publishing a complete collection of annual point data measurements to public, in a manner free of the impediments listed above.

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science, I mainly work on bioinformatics but my background is pretty ample.

Well, here's my story: in my country, there are very few academic opportunities after the PhD, thus I'm looking on new way to follow after. In the last month, I started working on a business intelligence thread for a really huge industry and there is a lot of data analytics to do. Actually, I didn't find huge issues on doing that, at least at this level (some simple analysis, plotting, decision making).

However, I'm becoming interested in a data scientist career, so I ask here: what do I need in order to be a successful data scientist? I already know all of the pragmatic things, e.g., I really proficient in python and I use a lot of numerical and graphical libraries, and as a PhD student my theory background is strong, e.g., a lot of knowledge on the database topic. Anyway, I really do not know where to start; I do not want to waste a lot of time and I'm willing to study and learn new things!

May you suggest me anything?

Noobie data scientist here. I'm looking for guidance and suggestions on methodologies or algorithms for dynamically assigning scores (1-10) to events based on frequency. Here's an example of what I want to do:

I've munged internal web logs for 100 IP addresses. Out of those, 10 accessed reddit on a given day:

    {
        wesbite: reddit.com,
        total_viewers: 10,
        average_page_views: 232.3,
        data: {
            [ip: 1, page_views:658],
            [ip: 2, page_views:90],
            [ip: 3, page_views:4],
            [ip: 4, page_views:935],
            [ip: 5, page_views:350],
            [ip: 6, page_views:222],
            [ip: 7, page_views:179],
            [ip: 8, page_views:20],
            [ip: 9, page_views:25],
            [ip: 10, page_views:40],
        }
    }

Basically, I want the scores assigned to  each IP to reflect their usage in comparison to the rest of the users observed visiting the site and the total IP set. If I were to manually assign scores, I'd take a look at the data and arbitrarily say page_views &gt; 900 are a 10, 900 &gt; page_views &gt; 700 are a 9, ... , page views &lt; 100 are a 1. Are their any mathematical models to help do this kind of thing dynamically?

If anyone wants to share their own system or tool(s) they use I'd love to hear it. Bonus points for anyone working with SQL.

76,2016-4-8,2016,4,8,10,4du5ea,Five Things I Learned Writing a Data Science Careers Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4du5ea/five_things_i_learned_writing_a_data_science/,Dogsindahouse1,1460077319,"1) There are several roles within data science, each with its own vocabulary. There isnt just a general data scientist position -- there are also data analysts, data engineers, business analysts and statisticians. You can find your perfect fit within the broad tent of data science teams.

2) You can enter data science from varied backgrounds, in many different ways. The people I interviewed came from very different walks in life. Some of them were academics, others were software engineers. Some have competed their way into the field with data science competitions which were open to the public.

3) Getting a data science job involves solving real-world problems. Some of the people I interviewed were only able to break into the field by dedicating spare time to solving data science problems on their own. They didnt sit around and wait for interviews--they used their skills to demonstrate how they could add value to an organization.

4) Data science can drive massive social impact. Not only for corporate problems, but long-standing social problems as well. The case studies I looked at have shown that data science helps charities operate much more efficiently in sub-Saharan Africa, improving thousands of lives.

5) There is going to be a shortage of data scientists. According to McKinsey, the US alone will face a shortage of 150,000+ data analysts and an additional 1.5 million data-savvy managers. This is driving higher salaries and better work-life balance for a career path that is much in demand from both the employer and employee side.

-- background --


I did not graduate from a specialty program or top Data Science university. I attended a state university for computer science and graduated with my bachelors in 2014 and will be graduating with a coursework-masters (no thesis) in May 2016. My coursework focus was on algorithm design and analysis, AI, big data architectures, and distributed system programming. I took on hard projects in my distributed coursework by implementing things like distributed file-systems, distributed hash tables, and sophisticated peer-to-peer networks from scratch. These projects gave me a ton of ammo to discuss in the interviews and the knowledge gained from them allowed me to move into Hadoop, Storm, and Spark with relative ease since I understood the core problems the respective framework was solving. My most proficient language is Java but am comfortable with Python as well.


-- the interview process --


The interesting interview was with the Director of Data Science. After a small algorithms problem we walked through (at a high level) how I would solve some problems in Map-Reduce and discussed architectural advantages in Spark. I was upfront in saying I had a less experience in stats and machine learning comparatively and he assured me it was something they would teach the right candidate. They then gave me a ""work-trial"" project which was to implement a portion of an existing production pipeline they had written from native Python into Spark (from data query to training a ML model and finding accuracy) for which I was paid double my current hourly rate. I think they gave me this project since I am still a student without a ton of industry experience. Upon completion I gave a small presentation on the work and received an offer. My day job will consist of designing, implementing, analyzing, and testing distributed machine learning pipelines using Spark, Scala, Python, and some other back-end services like AWS.

I'm working on a problem where I'm forecasting daily data for up to 30 days out.  One issue I'm noticing is that there are a few observations that appear to be outliers.  An example is say normally a Monday brings the largest quantity of the weekly total.  Say 4,000 of the total 5,000 weekly quantity.  But this Monday was a holiday, so instead this data was reported on a Tuesday.  Is there a way to systematically detect that the 0 that will occur on the following Monday is an outlier?  And the 4,000 that will occur on the following Tuesday is also an outlier?

I'm thinking something to do with a rolling median, but is there a way to make this two dimensional?  I just want to find outliers with respect to the day of week.

I enjoy programming a lot but it is the *everything else* part of what I have to do that I hate. When you work as a data analyst a lot of the time you can do ""modelling"" till the cows come home but usually what happens is that management won't know what it means, won't listen (because only ""they"" know the answer) or they will disagree with the model and you will be told to change your model to fit with managements hunch. Usually, you just end up producing tables with the average of something in it and some pretty bar graphs. 

I would love to work in a job where the results of analysis are a) useful and b) used. 

It seems to me that the methods employed in data science could be applied to situations where this is the case. 

We went to a meeting at work where we met with some ""Data Scientists"" who were going to build us this fabulous model for predicting ""something"" but my organization could not even present to them the question they wanted answered. 

I studied traditional statistics within an economics degree years ago and have an excellent level of knowledge of SAS programming and intermediate to advanced in SQL.. I have dabbled in many other languages from Python to R to Javascript but my main two are always SAS and SQL.

I am considering enrolling in a computer science degree at a reputable Australian university which allows students to study entirely online. 

My question is that while I have passed mathematics courses at university up to what you would call ""Calc III"" I am just not gifted at mathematics. Given that would I be better off simply pursuing a career in software development ? 

Do data scientists work on machine learning projects within software projects ? For example, a computer role playing game which learns how to adjust its  characters attributes according to the choices of the player ? 

Data science does seem really interesting to me but I am very wary of the fact that I am not of gifted intelligence I am just a normal person so I don't want to send myself down a career path for the gifted. 

If neither will work out, there is a big wide world out there and I am sure I can do something.

The field I am in now is getting stupidly competitive, with all of the degree holders from overseas coming to Australia and the popularity of the position I am thinking it is time to jump ship among other reasons.

Econ. Ever since, I've been working at a company in the top 30 of the Fortune 500 doing modeling with healthcare data (primarily with SAS and SQL, with some Excel and VBA as well). All things considered, it's a great gig for now, and I'm pulling close to $90k a year. That said, while the job requires a lot of data manipulation and familiarity with healthcare data, it's not that challenging from a statistical standpoint (the most challenging thing I might do is some regression analysis - nothing like machine learning) and frankly I'm not super passionate about healthcare in general. Long story short, I enjoy the programming/data side (I also dabble with Python/R in my spare time), but not really the subject matter.

As a result, I've recently begun looking into going back to school for a masters in statistics which would hopefully put me in position to gun for a job with more interesting and challenging work (ideally something along the lines of a statistician or data scientist). I actually did take the GRE last month and did fairly well (95%+ percentile in verbal/quant/written sections).  Anyways, some of the questions I had:

1) While I did take Calc 1-3 in my undergrad years as well as stats classes like Econometrics, I didn't take Linear Algebra, which seems to be listed as a prerequisite for many (if not all) statistics programs. I was wondering what people's advice might be to getting around this hurdle? Taking an online class? Taking a class at a community college?
2) Is getting a master's even a smart decision here? Would I be better of continuing to learn more about data science/stats off of MOOCs like Coursera? Furthermore, while I am interested in the course material, there has to be something said for cost. Could I expect to see a significant boost in salary with the masters (short term/long term)? After all, taking ~$20-40k in additional student loans and giving up a year of potential earnings, whilst manageable, isn't appealing if the increase in earnings after earning the masters is minimal.

3) This might be a dumb question, but would a profile like mine even be competitive for a top masters program? Programs I've been looking at have included Berkeley, University of Washington, Johns Hopkins, CMU, UNC, NCSU, etc.

I just wanted to share a thought after reading many blogs and articles like ""How to spot a fake data scientist"", ""10 questions to master for a data science interview"", etc.

Data science is imo a vast area where you need coding, business and statistics skills, not even talking about new fields as AI, deep learning etc.

I have the feeling a data scientist is a unicorn as we all have our strenght and weaknesses regarding one or more of the 3 big area of expertise I mention above. Thus it can generate a feeling of being a fraud amongst us: ""I'm good at this and this but I can't do what this guy mention in his article, does it mean I'm not worthy?"".

Problem is - I keep having second thoughts on if it's the right academic direction for me. I'm not academically trained and kind of fell into my role in the first place because I'm a dweeb with VBA/SQL and you guys probably understand better when it's information overload on a particular subject!

And theres a stage of Data Engineering where you have to work out how models are going to be deployed and consumed

But once the basics are in place (this might take 2-3 years), in my experience theres actually not **that** much data science work to do. its usually quite straightforward to get a 95% solution to a problem in a few weeks  and in a team with 10 or 20 data scientists, Im really curious what keeps people busy.  in my experience actually building models doesnt take long. especially for tree-ensemble models which tend to work quite well out of the box in terms of dealing well with outliers, missing values, etc.

Leaders talk a lot of talk about the amazing cool things theyd like to do with data but in my experience the bottleneck is more around building the products that use the models, not the analytics themselves.

Do you spend months trying to get that final 1-2% performance out of your models?

Do you have front-end skills that you can use to hack prototypes?

Do you spend a lot of time reading/writing blogs and papers, and answering questions on Reddit and Stackoverflow?

They seem pretty similar based on the available data (free, NY and SF programs, 7 weeks of projects and coaching, then interviews with partner companies) except that Insight has been around longer and I know a few people who have done it, so I understand it a little better. Also, the Data Incubator has a ""paid"" option, and the application process is way more work!

Specific things I'm wondering:
- Are their placement rates similar? 
- How similar are the companies they draw from?
- How well do they prepare you for the job? For interviews?
- Data Incubator's application asks more extensively about geographic preferences. Do they have partner companies in these other cities, or is this just to gauge interest for possible future new locations?",10,12

Traditionally a chop shop is somewhere people take hot cars to dismantle them and sell off the parts individually. So, you'd have a beautiful car that can do so much, but its engine that could take it from 0-60 in 4.2s is now being used in a Honda Civic and it works, but it doesn't belong.

Similarly, what I meant by a chop shop was: a company that hires a ""data scientist"" because the manager went to a conference and their only take-away was that a DS would increase profits ten-fold, but once they've got their hire, they're using him to use VBA to create reports in Excel, but discourage any growth or development, because they don't need you to ""forecast sales"", right now, just carry on running the reports we tell you to.",9,17

TL;DR: After not getting into medschool again, I have chosen to pursue data science gradschool. I have 2 options: spend the next year taking computer science/math courses in attempt to apply to a top tier program (either masters or phd), or should I rush to get my application in at a newer program that is more expensive but has a great sounding program? Any input would be helpful!

my background: I have a degree in chemistry, and for the past 4 years I have been working in a molecular pathology lab as a research assistant, and have been volunteering/other stuff in attempt to get into medical school. After 2 years of getting waitlisted and rejected, i have decided to take a step back and investigate other career paths (aka getting a masters). Working in a research lab and being tasked with extracting, coding, analyzing, large data sets from lots of independent, clunky, and non-linked clinical databases has got me interested in pursuing a degree in informatics. I see the enormous amount of value that machine learning, data mining, data analysis, visualization, ect... can bring to many industries and I am very excited to continue down this path.

I have strong critical thinking and quantitative analysis skills, however i am a novice programmer and my calculus needs some work (currently spending ~3-5 hours a day to improve this on top of my full time job). Since medschool let me know fairly late into the gradschool application cycle, i am faced with 2 options:

1)  get my application in to a few of the schools that have not passed the deadline and pass the programing/calculus competency based exams they offer. The main one i am interested is the Galvanized masters in data science through the university of new haven. This is a boot camp company that has teamed with a university to offer a 12 month super intensive data science masters degree. I've spoken with some students and professors there and the program actually sounds really impressive. They also have a big focus on connecting you with companies to get a job both during and after the program. My only concern is it is a newer program, it's pretty expensive (SF cost of living so crazy), and it's name is not as widely recognized as other institutions. 


2) Spend the next year taking classes, continue working in the lab (for not much money), and try to leverage my diverse background to get into a program with more name recognition. 


the second option is difficult for me in a few ways. First, i've been mentally prepared to make a big life transition (into medical school) for 3 years now and the thought of waiting around another year (year and a half actually) to start school while making 28k/year sounds really unappealing. There are also a number of other factors that are a lot cleaner if i was to start school in aug, but i'll spare the details. If anyone has any words of wisdom to offer, I would be extremely grateful. These past few weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions and I could really use some guidance. ",13,0

This is inevitable in my opinion. Is it happening now? and if so, what are you doing to prepare for the ensuing flood of graduates from these MS in data science programs?

As for me, I'm a statistician who hasn't been working as a 'data scientist' for too long. My plan is to go back to traditional statistician jobs. I'm already at a place where I'm the statistics expert while everyone else is a ML or CS expert, so that's my plan in about a year or two.

I am currently doing a school project as per the title. I am currently writing a web crawler to get two different files : one for MMA fighters with as much stats about them as possible, and one for all the fights which already took place.

My goal is to find the best indicators of success in a fight. Things like ""If a fighter is taller than his opponent, he will probably win the fight"". The final goal is to elaborate a formula which, for two given fighters, tells which one is more likely to win statistically.

I'm sorry that I can't put this in better terms, but data science is really not my field, I am just very interested in it.

I would love to go in depth, but again, I'm not doing statistics alone as a subject.

I have found out through the previous link a website called [Metacademy](https://metacademy.org/browse) which gives you several ways to follow a subject, either based on topics or MOOCs and also there is Roadmap which helps master a topic on your own.

After doing a bit of Machine Learning reading, up to Linear Regression(also Multi-variable) from the Trevor and Hastie book, The Elements of Statistical Learning, I have come to the conclusion that it is better to pursue Statistics to continue forwards.

But looking at this, is confusing me, and I'm currently confused about the direction of course I should be heading, so I have decided to do the Coursera MOOC, Data Analysis and Statistical Inference from Duke University taught by Mine C Rundel. While, I also have my eyes on Joseph Blitzstein's Harvard Probability course(Stat 110) and Statistics One of Princeton(MOOC).

I'm also considering taking the Datacamp Intro to Statistics taught by the same professor as Statistics One to follow the MOOC through the slides available(as the course is closed).

Please comment on my direction.

If I told you I wanted to become a teacher, doesn't matter what kind, I would like to think anyone reading this, would have a clear image of what that is, and how someone could become a teacher. Easy enough, yes?

When I approach 'data science', and I have been half-heartedly researching it for a year or so now, the path gets a bit convoluted. I can give you the, 'a data scientist knows more programing than x, and more stats than y' answer, or post a venn diagram or chart of 'how to become a data scientist in 10^23 easy steps' or say that all one has to do is learn R, Stats, Python, Machine Learning, etc, etc and know how they apply to finding value in a data set answer, BUT that still seems really nebulous. 

So my question is this.
Can someone(s) please distill the all-encompassing 'data science' term for me a bit? Maybe break it down into some more defined areas, with somewhat clearer career paths? 

Just to clarify what I am looking for with the teaching example again. Say I do want to become a teacher. I would decide I want to teach a certain subject, or a certain grade, or both, depending.

New to reddit, so apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit and for any mistakes I may make in the future. 

Today I had an interview for a position that has quite the bit of potential. Essentially it is being the only person so far to measure and optimize a huge (really huge) company. Using anything from Google Analytics to Mix Panel to the companies countless other marketing tools to get the job done. 

I have done some previous analysis in the past, but the data was streamlined from an online marketplace since it was digital marketing/adverting. I imagine with this new job, should I get it, it won't be that easy. 

So I guess the question is where would I even begin with such a daunting task? How would I get the data let alone measure it? There are so many variables and my head is spinning, and from what I understand from the interviews there is no one else doing this, it's a whole new area with me being the only one working in it. It's exciting, but I'd like to send some follow up emails to ask the right questions and get a general idea of how to proceed to show initiative.

I plan to graduate from the Univeristy of Michigan with a Double Major in Data Science/ Computer Science and Minors in Business Analytics and Writing.

My dream is to work my way up to a consultant in my mid 20's to 30's  and then settle down in a management role at a large company after. Again my dream is also to earn a hefty salary, enough to support myself and family in any endeavor I take.

I have read almost every post on this subreddit and talked to many data scientists personally and I know this dream is farfetched. However I am determined.

So the question is, can any of you experienced Data Scientists give me specific advice that I can put towards making my dream a reality? It can be anything from what college classes to take to what internships and jobs to pursue.

I've recently have taken a great interest in Data science (like everyone and their grandmother). I know variations on this question have been asked a few times before, but I was wondering if any of you have had experience transitioning to the field of data analytics through accredited cert(s). 

I'm a recent graduate with a BSc in Biochemistry, and would like to pursue a Master's in data science; I've been doing a regiment of self-study, including python, bayesian probability and statistics, but want to test the waters before committing to a more rigorous environment.  

Living in Toronto, I am considering the Big Data and Advanced Analytics Cert offered by the Chang School. Would this be a good stepping stone, or should I just cut out the middleman and apply for the master's?

Sounded like an easy project at first. However, the more I dig in, the more confused I make myself. I'm kind of at a loss about how to start and would like some thoughts about how to approach.

The data set includes:

* date
* time of delivery
* revenue
* lat &amp; long
* type of product
* fulfillment location (where it was shipped from)

I've tried using DBSCAN, based solely on geo-location, but that doesn't take sales volume into account. A tight cluster of delivery addresses is worthless if they haven't ordered frequently or with large order sizes.

https://github.com/peacing/DataScience-Tutorials/tree/master/Udac-MLE/capstone/data

The issue I'm having is that for Elasticnet and Lasso regression, the coefficients are 0 for all features. I've tried different values of alpha to see if less regularization would at least allow one of the coefficients to become non-zero, but haven't had any luck.

I know L1 Reg produces sparse solutions, but what's going on here? Is it just that none of my features are important enough? I'm using features like No. of Bedrooms, No. of Reviews, Review Rating to predict the listing price of a property.

The notebook where I'm fitting the different regression models [can be found here](https://github.com/peacing/DataScience-Tutorials/tree/master/Udac-MLE/capstone) and is called regression-regularization.ipynb.

I have a question about a particular paper which is about converting categorical data to numerical (the paper is under URL below):

http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sboriah/PDFs/ChandolaCBK2009.pdf

The authors describe 4 heuristics that can be derived from categorical data -- this is in order to map categorical data to numerical. These heuristics are d_m, f_m, n_x, f_x. They also provide two examples y and z and the values of the quantities above computed with respect to dataset in table 3. I am able to lock into their values exactly for d_m and f_m but I cannot reproduce n_x and f_x. 

Could someone read this paper and try to derive these values? I basically take it their equation (3.3) shows summation of reciprocals of arity for A_x set (i.e. the set of mismatching attributes) -- I can't reproduce -5.45 and -7.90. 

Please note I already contacted the authors -- one responded that Dr. Boriah is the person responsible for these calculations but he is apparently not reacheable.",1,2

TL;DR
I need advice on a bachelor's degree.

NLE;WM (Not Long Enough; Want More)
I did a quick browse and search, and it looks like I'm in exactly the opposite position of most people that come here asking for help. but I'm getting ahead of myself.

I love data. I see patterns everywhere I go, I analyze those patterns (even the ones that I know are meaningless), and I do what I can to learn from them.

I'm also really good with computers in general, and Excel specifically. And I program and understand databases.

For the last 9 months (and about 2 years out of the 4 I worked at my last job) I've been a ""data analyst"". At my last job, this meant running KPI reports, and making data jump through hoops in Excel. At my current job, it means actually designing reports to answer specific questions, finding ways to extract and correlate data from various systems, and provide (brief) analysis of that data to stakeholders.

I'm good at (and really enjoy) my job. I just have one problem: No degree. My current employer is receptive to a tuition reimbursement program, but first I need to find a degree program.

2) As a high schooler, what can I do now (and in the summer) to get a headstart on the data scientist track? I'm pretty comfortable with python and have taken some intro data science courses (numPy and Pandas in Python via Udacity, R course via coursera) and I really like statistics.

An algorithm is a series of steps with rules that help us solve problems and accomplish goals. And when we structure these steps and rules the right way we can automate the algorithm to establish Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). And it is this A.I. that helps us do our analytical heavy lifting so we can focus our time on doing the things that were good at the things we were hired to do.

A.I. is changing our jobs, our work styles, and our business cultures. A.I. helps us discover and focus on the key subject matter expertise that makes our human capital good, really good at what they do. But using A.I. in the work place does get complicated. It gets complicated because there are different levels of algorithms used to implement A.I., each varying in their use and impact. To better balance our human capital with our A.I. capital, here are the top 10 algorithm categories used to implement A.I., Big Data, and Data Science.

We're talking tech companies with five + teams of PhD data scientists. Instead, they are working on problems using mixed effects models, decision trees, survival models, and so forth. Of course, as a statistician, I prefer to work with standard statistical procedures, so I don't mind at all. However, it was it was still puzzling given how much talk there is about ML there is on sites like this and Quora. Are many of you really doing ML work or is that the exception to the rule. These experiences plus the recent flowing data post*** got me thinking about what other data scientist actually do at work.

For what it's worth, I ended up at a start up doing a lot of ML work. Of course, they'd be better off using mixed effect regression with splines, but that's a different story.

Let's say that in a supervised learning problem, I have a training dataset D comprised of samples x and their corresponding labels w. From this data, I attempt to learn the true distributions p(x|w) with some estimate q(x|w) . This estimate could be a simple parametric distribution p(x|parameter) where I learned the parameter from training data for each class) or it can be the full bayesian distribution p(x|D for each class) with the parameter integrated out). To classify new instances, I want to use the Bayes classifier that maximizes the posterior given the new instances and the training data above some confidence value. So for example if I have 3 independent samples, I can say q(w|x_1,x_2,x_3) proportional to q(x_1 | w) q(x_2 | w) q(x_3 | w) q(w)$. My question is: how do I deal with data that is highly unlikely (small q(x|w)) under all classes? What is the bayesian approach to do this? I can think of heuristics like if the likelihoods for a given sample x fall below a threshold, I reject it and try to collect new evidence. The threshold could be computed by finding the regions where most of the mass is located and samples outside of that are outliers. If I had the true distributions, then I wouldn't have this problem, but since I have estimates, I want to be able to consider the case that my model may be wrong. Rejecting a sample doesn't sound very Bayesian to me. To illustrate what I mean, I can provide the following example: I have 2 classes with equal priors p(w) and the 2 estimated conditional distributions: N(0,0.1) for w_1 and N(0.1,0.1) for w_2. If I want to classify new instances and I measure x_1=0.043, I get q(w_1 | x_1) = 0.5175 and q(w_2| x_1) = 1-0.5175. Since I'm not confident about the class, I measure a new sample x_2 = 0.042. Then, q(w_1 | x_1,x_2) = 0.5374 and q(w_2 | x_1,x_2) = 1-0.5374. It looks that I'm leaning towards class 1. However, if I measure a new sample x_3 = 3, I get that q(w_2 | x_1,x_2,x_3) = 1 due to the fact that the likelihood q(x_3 | w_2) &gt;&gt; q(x_3 | w_1). Since I only have estimates of the true distributions, x_3 seems like an outlier and shouldn't have that much weight in classification. What is the Bayesian way of dealing with this problem?",1,2

Do you just have stored procedures that are constantly calculating this lagged variables on the back end and then you just read in that data when a transaction comes through?

- 5 years experience in financial services doing business improvement and change management.  
- Advanced Excel skills.  
- Basic working knowledge of SAS, SQL and R.  
- Extensive experience preparing business cases, dashboards and reports

Throughout my career I've been responsible for developing dashboards and ah hoc-reports, and providing simple descriptive statistics using Excel and MS Access. However, I've forgotten much of my college level stats and calculus. So far I've completed Khan Academy's Algebra II, Trigonometry, Probability and Statistics and some pre-calculus to revise the mathematics I haven't used for years. 

My plan is to quit my job and study the following topics full time for 3 months:    
- Single variable calculus - using MIT and/or Khan Academy     
- Probability and statistics refresher using this course: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/index.htm

2. Would I have enough working knowledge after the course to get a job as a junior data analyst / data scientist?    
3. From a junior role could I work towards a career as a data scientist by learning on the job and studying further in my own time?
