^(~~*yes, I am fully aware that gif says 2015/2016, but you get my point and its so cute so....*~~)

Wow! What a year 2016 was for EXO.. Lets take a moment to appreciate some of the things they did: first double title release, first solo, first sub unit, first *new* Japanese track release, [~~first time dancing with canes~~](https://vine.co/v/5AWJVBWl7wl), first dramas for some (plus awards! *i'm looking at you baek!*)... never mind all the records they broke like winning the daesang 4 years in a row, becoming triple million sellers and Lay's solo album breaking records on the Hanteo charts for solo artists. Across all the members (past &amp; present) the boys released a total of 10 albums *(not including multiple versions or singles/OSTs)*. 


I mean... I could go on forever or you could watch [exo sexo's new video showing everything the boys as a group accomplished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZKLPt8eXM4&amp;feature=youtu.be)... *I'm not crying, you are!*
2016 was seriously such a blessed year and I am sure I speak for all of us when I say I can't wait to see what 2017 will bring. ^(*insert emotes :xiuyell: :suhomg: here*)

This week we have Chanyeol's new drama ""The Missing 9"" and the Seoul Music Awards to look forward too!  

We have about 23 new subscribers join us this week!  In case you are new, Casual Convo is for a general discussion on just about anything (EXO, Kpop, life).  It's also the place to post those neat EXO finds you make (that don't warrant their own post)!  So if you're new, or if you have something you'd like to share - this is the place!

86,2017-1-16,2017,1,16,14,5o8x6r,Official r/EXO Discord Chat,jamiepiper,1484543019,"Hi everyone! You may have heard that r/exo opened up a Discord Server a few months ago, but we never really put an official announcement out there. You can access it by clicking [this link](https://discord.gg/puP3bds) anytime or by clicking the link in the subreddit's sidebar under About. 

#What is Discord? 

Well, [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a free text and voice chat platform that is available through your web browser and also by download on [Windows/Mac](https://discordapp.com/download) or your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&amp;hl=en) &amp; [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-gamers/id985746746?mt=8) devices. 

Discord was made for Gamers originally but KPOP servers have popped up like crazy and are taking over since the platform makes it very easy to share images, gifs, videos, links, and to just chill and talk to tons of people who love similar things (like exo, haha).

#Information on our Server

Our server has been set-up with several chat channels so you can stay up to date with all the members. Each member has their own channel to chat and post photos/videos in, there is a fandom channel for fan art, fan fiction and fan videos and even a music bot so you can jump in and listen to exo (or other music) with other people. There are always people around to chat with, especially during live streams. 

You will find the same team of moderators over on the r/exo server plus a few more. We enforce the same rules as the subreddit on the server, so please be mindful of this. If you look in the 'welcome' channel you will find all the enforced rules. Warnings will be issued if you break the rules but after several offenses the mods reserve the right to kick or ban you. The mods work very hard to supervise the chat as much as possible but we ask people to let us know if there are any issues that may come up.

The welcome channel also has a *'new to discord'* section for people who are new to the platform. It outlines the basics of how to use everything but it is very easy and takes no time to get used to it. Plus all the members are extremely nice and will be willing to help you out when you join. 

##[**Official Link**](https://discord.gg/puP3bds)

Please let us know in the comments below or by PM'ing me if you need help with discord. 

We hope to see everyone join up and chat with us all! 

&lt;3 love the r/exo mods &amp; r/exo discord mods!

It is a bit long, so give yourself a bit of time to do it ~ note, not all sections are mandatory, so watch along the top to see if there is a note that you can skip the section if you feel you don't want to answer it/or don't know how to answer it. It will be up for a total of 2 weeks and afterwards we will release the information in a nice document. We look forward to hearing from you!

You may have heard already but Japan broadcasted a [big portion](http://i.imgur.com/mV35Zvb.jpg) of the EXO'rDIUM last night and my brain is already exploding at the thought of high quality performances. ~~someone get me that upload right noooooooow~~.

We have had about 24 new subscribers join us this week! If you are new or haven't introduced yourself before and feel comfortable enough to,  please do so in the comments below! *Please tell us your bias, I swear we won't spam you with photos.....*  

For those who aren't aware, this thread is designed for everyone to post about whatever topic you want, whether kpop/exo related or not. This thread is also a good place to post things that do not warrant their own post (maybe a throwback, or a fan edit ect).

The Census is still going! We will be leaving it up for another week if you haven't had the chance to take it yet. It is a bit long, so give yourself a bit of time to do it. Once you get past the mandatory questions you will reach a question allowing you to skip the rest of the sections such as concert and acting related sections or to continue on. Note: these sections still aren't mandatory even if you only want to answer a few questions here &amp; there. Once the census is closed, we will release all the information in a nice document for you guys to all review. We look forward to hearing from you!

* what style, musically, do you hope their comeback is going to be like this year?
* what do you want to see included on their album?
* what concept do you want them to take on?
* what activities/shows/variety do you want to see them do?

I'm super duper happy and over the moon right now because I'm planning on attending Exo's LA show in April. I've never been to a kpop concert before and this will be my first one, so I wanted to get all your opinions! 

I know that the floor is GA. The venue seems pretty large though, and I guess I'm nervous that either a) I won't be able to see Exo from behind people and b) people will be really aggressive. Does anyone have experience on the floor? Was it too crazy? Or was it worth it? 

Otherwise, I guess I'd consider getting the closest seated ticket I can get. I want to get as close as I can, but also be comfortable. 

Any opinions and advice are most welcome!!! 

(P.S. Anyone know where I can buy a V2 lightstick? They're sold out on like...every website ever...I'm so emo because I /really/ want one for the show but I can't seem to find one right now. Do y'all think this will be sold at the show? :/)",26,14

EXO has been my bias group since 2013, a few months before XOXO came out. I didn't like them at first. I thought ""Mama"" was superfluous, indulgent, and above all cheesy. But that Kai though... his eyes, his moves, all burned into my soul. Once I heard ""History"" it was game over. To this day, it's still my favourite EXO song.

After getting to know the guys, Chanyeol chose me. I am his. I would lay down in traffic for that kid. Lay was my EXO-M bias (because I come form a time it was OKAY to have two biases in EXO) and I still love him dearly to this day. In the k-drama of my life, Chanyeol is the good looking, aloof love interest, and Lay is that wonderful, supportive, sweet second lead. Damn.

I run an EXO fan club and it's my pride and joy. It's hard to balance my free time, real life, and k-pop, but I am sure my fellow noonas will understand this. My boyfriend is pretty tolerant of my k-pop love, as has been hearing about it for 4 years now. He thinks the music is pretty good, but it's really not his thing at all. He doesn't say much about the fact I have bias wallpapers on every device, but I'm sure he thought it was odd I had a thing for young Asian men all of a sudden. He did once accuse me once of being too obsessed so I do my best to keep my k-poppery to myself on a secondary Twitter, Tumblr, etc. What do your partners think?

Nice to meet you all :)",54,31

Author Description:

&gt; Yifan pokes at the hourglass, and after deciding that it is probably will not explode, picks it up gingerly. The dark blue sand grains shift in one half of the hourglass and a single grain falls to the bottom bulb. *You have two months to live.* Yifan realizes with a jolt that this is an indicator of his life.

&gt; He narrows his eyes. It has to be his mother's fault. It has to be.

If you are one of those new subscribers, and wondering what the purpose of this post is, Casual Convo is for a general discussion on just about anything (EXO, Kpop, life).  It's also the place to post questions or neat EXO finds, or show of some of your fandom talent (when they don't warrant their own post)!

**About our weekly event:** Every Saturday at 7PM EST, the members of this sub meet in our Cytube chatroom. Once gathered, we queue and watch EXO related videos; chat and fangasm together. The content ranges from concerts, fancams, variety, MVs, interviews, dramas, FMVs, etc. This goes on until everyone leaves or gets too tired, so even if you show up a few hours behind, we will most likely still be in there.

From it we have created a new plan that we hope everyone will be just as interested in.

#Changes
* **Name:** We used to called this event EXO-L Showtime, but we realize that was probably confusing to most subbies. Going forward the events will be called *EXO-L Weekly Watch: Theme Edition.* 
* **Date+Time:** We are moving this to Sundays now and it will begin at 2PM EST and go on for a certain amount of hours. When the rough schedule is posted the day before, there will be a estimate for how long the event will go on for, we assume it will be anywhere between 4-8 hours, allowing people more time to join when they can.
* **Themes:** Every week will have a theme, it can be anything from member-related to song-related or even movie days. A rough schedule of ideas will be posted the day before the watch and themes will be posted a month in advance so people know when particular themes are happening. When the rough schedule is posted the day before, please feel free to leave comments with recommendations of things you would like to watch! 
* **Layout:** There will be significant improvements made to our cytube channel for the launch date this Sunday. You will be able to post image links now with previews and things will be much brighter so it is more enjoyable.

#Upcoming Schedule 

* **Sunday March 26th @ 2:00 PM EST:** Xiumin Birthday Edition 
* **Sunday April 1st @ 2:00 PM EST:** EXOrDIUM Concert Edition
* **Sunday April 9th @ 2:00 PM EST:** EXO Anniversary Edition
* **Sunday April 16th @ 2:00 PM EST:**  Sehun Birthday Edition 
* **Sunday April 23rd @ 2:00 PM EST:** Luhan Birthday Edition
* **Sunday April 30th @ 2:00 PM EST:** Tao Birthday Edition
* **Sunday May 7th @ 2:00 PM EST:** Baekhyun Birthday Edition

#Cytube Notes - Please Read


Please note that our cytube is going through some changes, so you will need to make a few adjustments possibly when you arrive. 


1. You will see a small panel below the chat that will have Display Modes &amp; Themes. From there, change your theme to **LIGHT** or **BOOTSTRAP**, this will make the chat much more readable. If you check off the text that says Fluid it will make your chat + video player much bigger. 

1. If you are new to cytube, along the top there are a few different things to pick from, Select Options then go over to **Chat** and turn off Show timestamps in Chat. This will make the chat easier to follow as well. 

1. You are now able to paste links into the chat and photo previews will appear! Wooo!

- I know tickets are randomly drawn at the hotel near the date. Are there any kind of benefits to getting the best ticket/closest seating, such as will premium package buyers receive closer tickets ? (Vs the deluxe, superior, or economy packages?) Or is it all random? 

-From experience does anyone feel the tickets will still be good placement for a venue of this size? Especially with the concert being special encore shows? The venue is enormous and I know global package tends to get better tickets than most but I'm concerned due to the encore shows and venue size. I know either way it will be a fun experience but I'm hoping to have a general idea.

Thank you for any tips and info! :)",6,10

22,2017-5-5,2017,5,5,19,69dzb2,170504 Kris talks about respecting and understanding hip hop culture,brunchingermany,1493981909,"Recently, iQiyis new show The Rap of China  held a press conference to give us a better understanding of the program. Buying the rights from South Koreas Show Me the Money, the show is to follow a similar concept in showcasing the countrys hidden rap talents. There are four producers on the show: Kris Wu, Wilber Pan, A-Yue (also known as Chang Chen-yue) and MC Hotdog.

Kris Wu sat down for an interview with Sina and touches upon some interesting points. We have translated the interview which discusses views on the show, hip hop, and what he hopes to achieve.

**Sina:** This time you are participating in the contest style program as a producer and it requires strong professionalism. Did you feel uneasy before coming [on the show]?

**Kris:** No, because Ive always been doing hip hop music so I have an understanding about the cultural background, including hip hops current direction and Chinas current situation regarding hip hop. Like I just said, Chinas current hip hop music type is 70-80% trap. Ive also heard a lot more new school type music, not just rap. I also hope to bring the program more different forms of expression. I have a lot of confidence in this [topic].

**Sina:** Do you have a lot of confidence in taking on the role of a producer too?

**Kris:** I think, this time, each producer (Wilber Pan, A-Yue, MC Hotdog) has a different expertise. I also have my own advantage. Its more about how we can all work hard together to bring Chinese hip hop music some new blood. So, its not really a thing I can do on my own, it needs the hard work of everyone.

**Sina:** Some netizens believe that the producers are considered more mainstream and wouldnt be able to truly represent the voices of underground hip hop, what do you think of this issue?

**Kris:** Firstly, I think depending on what kind of circle you are in, you will be affected by that circle, this is definite. Out of our three producer teams, the ones that are considered more underground are our teachers, MC Hotdog and A-Yue. Wilber and myself are considered to be working more in the public eye, doing more mainstream things. But personally, Ive always wanted to use different ways to make hip hop music more mainstream and allow the mainstream audience to accept hip hop, so Ive been trying to find a bridge like this. How I can combine the melodies that the general public likes with hip hop but not lose the foundation of hip hop is something Ive always been trying to do.

So like the question you just asked, I think its because of the different environments. If I was in the underground music circle, my musical style and the lyrics I write may be different from the music that Ive been releasing because I wouldnt need to cater to the general public at all. But because Im currently in a more mainstream environment, my goal is to allow more people to access and enjoy this type of music. So, when Im making my music I will consider the feelings of the general audience more.

**Sina:** So the music youre currently making does try to cater to the public?

**Kris:** Right, because I think in order to make a music genre, including its culture, universal and broaden its boundaries, you need the public to expand their understanding. So how do you get the publics appetite? You need to take a familiar melody and put it in something new that youve created. After theyve listened to it, theyll think ah, it sounds quite familiar, it sounds quite beautiful, but it doesnt sound like the ballads I usually listen to and has a lot more beats to it. That way, it might be easier for them to accept, that is my method.

**Sina:** The attitude that hip hop lyrics present is the essence of this type of genre. For example, are there any topics that inspired you and made you want to express yourself?

**Kris:** I dont actually have anything I really want to express right now, Im quite well, right now. (laughs) You may be referring to the more rebellious attitude, to to me, I dont wish to write music that way. This is indeed the image that people have toward this genre.  They think that it needs to give a fierce hit, but its actually not like that always. There are a lot of hip hop songs that cover different types of normal situations like walking on the streets, walking on grass, when by the sea (simple feelings like that). Its not something thats definite. The type youre referring to is more of the gangsta rap type from back in the day, thats one type but not everything is like that.

**Sina:** Have you ever asked the production team why they asked you to become a producer? And what is the main reason this program attracted you?

**Kris:** Ive never asked about the reason why they chose me. I believe they must have heard my music, that makes the most sense. I also didnt really promote myself.

As for my decision, I did have a lot to consider about doing this reality show. I really think that its a pretty good platform to promote hip hop culture. If you want something to do well, one persons hard work is not enough. You need more fresh blood mixed together to push the entire market forward and attract a lot more music producers to do hip hop music.

Perhaps some music producers will say, The ballads I make earn more money and sell better. I have needs everywhere and hip hop has such a small audience. I dont know where I can find investors so how could I maintain a living? But now, we want to use this way to allow more people get into it and create more demand for it. This way, it will make the market consider it. So, I think, although I cant say [the program] will definitely be successful, since no one really knows, it is definitely a good start.

**Sina:** You mentioned earlier that you are trying to mix hip hop with current popular music to make it easier for the public to accept the genre, so when youre choosing contestants will you be more likely to choose the ones that have a more mainstream feel? So for example, the contestants that are less likable, you wouldnt consider them?

**Kris:** Ive been thinking about this issue too. I dont have a good answer right now, it would probably depend on the contestants performance. Of course, I will go toward the ones that I think are more well rounded. The ones that have possibility of becoming popular will get plus points. But if your style is very underground yet you performed very well and if youre very good and have a lot of talent, Ill think since you can handle this you must be able to handle other things too. You will have potential (I would consider that).

**Sina:** A lot of hip hop contests overseas have a battle segment, both sides will diss each other, are you worried about being dissed by a contestant?

**Kris:** No, if youre better than me you can diss me. But if youre not better than me, dont diss me.

**Sina:** The three producer teams will definitely have some moments of conflict, have you thought about how to handle that?

**Kris:** I have never thought that wed have conflict.

**Sina:** What about if all three teams want one contestant?

**Kris:** Ah, then it would depend on who the contestant picks. If everyone chooses the same contestant, itll be up to the contestant.

**Sina:** Earlier, A-Yue and MC Hotdog said theyre strict producers, even straight up said losers go home early type of words. What about you? Will you go the powerful route of giving criticism or very gentle?

**Kris:** Im definitely going to be very strict. When it comes to music, you must be very strict in order to pick the truly best contestant. But I think my attitude will be kinder, I might not say much.. (laughs).

**Sina:** Do you remember when was the first time you listened to hip hop?

**Kris:** When I was around 10 years old. At the time, I was overseas and I liked to play basketball. Basketball is also a sport that is dominated by black people and hip hop comes from American black culture.

The mainstream breakthrough of hip hop started in America in the 90s, that was considered its golden age. Back then, I was still very young and in 2000 I stared to pay a lot of attention to it and really liked it. When I played basketball, I heard a lot of hip hop. When I watched basketball, they always played hip hop, so I really grew interest in the culture. At the time, I would bring around an mp3 player and it would be pretty much filled with hip hop music.

**Sina:** Who did you listen to the most in the beginning? Did you have any special crazy fan moments?

**Kris:** The most obvious (that Id imitate) is hip hop style clothing. At the time, Id wear baggy clothes because it was really popular to wear oversized pants and t-shirts, the really big ones. As for music, Id listen to the ones everyone at the time was pretty familiar with, like 50 cent.

**Sina:** Are there any hip hop works that influence your personal musical style a lot?

**Kris:** Every year its different. Every year, there are new musical styles that come out. Hip hop is actually changing really quickly- whats popular today may be changed into something else tomorrow. It will always be changing.

**Sina:** So would you say the risk in doing this type of music is pretty big? You said hip hop is frequently changing, so you could be eliminated easily.

**Kris:** Yes, a little. Hip hop and EDM types of music change faster than ballads. Ballads will always be based on the melody, when a song depends on whether the melody sounds good or not, the changes in the music wont be much. But hip hop and EDMs changes in element are greater.

**Sina:** Nowadays, a lot of youngsters like hip hop, what do you think needs to be prepared in order to enter the hip hop circle? Or, what should they do?

**Kris:** First, I think you need to understand the cultural background and find a hip hop artist that you like. You need an idol, every person needs someone to learn from in order to grow. I think this is very important. I think right now were missing a platform, missing a method to allow them to join and express. This is also another reason why I came on this show. Before, the contest shows mainly focused on finding singers, people who sang well or are good looking, but The Rap of China is different. Its entirely based on your musical talents and only focus on hip hop. You cant get through with just singing love songs here, but if you sing well youll get extra points, definitely.

**Sina:** Do you think the way you dress is important when it comes to hip hop? Most people would start from copying the fashion, right?

**Kris:** Its okay. But I feel like if you want to dress that way you should understand why you are dressed that way. For example, why do I wear such baggy pants? Why do I wear my pants at my crotch and expose half my ass? You need to understand the origin. A lot of hip hop fashion is baggy because back then the people were very poor and could only wear their parents hand-me-downs. So their clothes would be really big, they wear them from their youth until they get older.*** Why do they wear do-rags? Why do they style their hair like that? This is a culture, they need to understand the culture before they start dressing that way. Although, it is your freedom if you want to wear it without understanding the culture, but if you dont understand it I think youre missing the significance.

*** = This is referenced in Killer Mikes song Thats Life

*We wear our fuckin pants big*

*Because our mothers were too poor to buy our size*

*So they had to buy two or three sizes up*

*Call it what it is n----: poverty*

*Its fuckin poverty*

Author Description:

&gt; Wolves are roaming the Earth with only one goal in life; to find their Master. The dangerous animal strikes fear in the population and the cities have reached their limits, unable to take in any more refugees. Everyone were left with one question as they hid behind the safe walls that had been built to protection them from the evil; how can one human being control such a wild animal? How can they create that strong connection with a wolf that they can make them do whatever they want? It seemed impossible, it *was* impossible.

&gt; The Government soon had enough; all the wolves and their Masters were to be killed with no exceptions. What the Government did not know, was that the wolves could walk among them, look like them, and talk like them.

&gt; A war was on the brink between the humans and their guns and the vengeful Masters and their loyal pets; and Park Chanyeol had been thrown into the middle of it.

With a comeback fast approaching, /u/galyndean gave us a great idea for a bit of fun here on /r/exo!  We're going to do a three round song showdown!  

**Round One:** Vote for your ***least favourite*** song in each section.  There's 13 sections - so be warned!  We will remove the songs with the most votes from each category bringing the number of songs remaining in each category to four (where applicable).

**Round Two:** Vote for your favourite song from each category to determine the winner for each release!

**Round Three:** We amalgamate the winners into one final round for our favourite song overall!"")  

Note:  This is for fun, no one HAS to participate.  Don't feel like going through 13 sections?  No problem - wait for a later round!  We linked videos in the majority of sections so you can listen to each song (in case you forget what El Dorado sounds like...). You have until next Sunday to get your vote in!

I will have this post up until the dogs have successfully been found. Id greatly appreciate anyone who would kindly let me know if you happen to chance upon or have any information about them. I apologise once again for asking such a favour from you.""

94,2017-7-14,2017,7,14,0,6n29x1,"What's wrong with eXO members having ""weird"" hair?",mryakov,1499959310,"I personally think Kai's dreads looked good on him. I don't see it failing to be culturally appropriate since the hairstyle is not restricted to one culture only.

Baekhyun's long hair also provided a new look for him that was not limited to hair color changes. Note: I have been listening to their music for years but only recently have I really 'stalked' them so I'm not sure if they have tried different/weird hairstyles before.

Successfully promoting something means embracing the whole concept of it and I think the pictures they've showed us so far didn't fail in doing so. The clothes matched with the hair, the colors that were used felt right for the setting, etc.

Also, they're idols! I'm sure they can rock anything! From dreads to long hair, even mohawk or buzz cut. Supporting the decision of their managers or their hairstylists means supporting EXO as well.

But IDK I'm just a guy who likes music.

~~(Totally unrelated to EXO but) Why Does The Title Automatically Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word?~~ Edit: It's a trick! Thanks u/Turquoise-Turmoil for clarifying that :)

&gt; Oh Semi is sent into FBI witness protection after filming a crime of notorious gang leader Luhan, but it hasnt stopped said boss from tracking her across countries to prevent her from testifying against him.  After the latest and most terrifying assassination attempt, Seoul PD suggests an arranged marriage between Semi and jailed gangster Xiumin, Lu Han's blood brother, as a last resort.

&gt; Apparently family are off-limits in the Blood Brother Code.  It would mean Luhan cant kill her.

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War/Ko Ko Bop comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of this month, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

Yeah, I know, never a fun topic, but it is a necessary one; reading this now will save you headaches and lost karma points in the future.

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as don't be a dick.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!

##Where to Buy the Album

Mind you, you can buy an physical album from numerous retailers, but only the ones listed below guarantee that the sale will count towards the Korean Gaon/Hanteo Charts, which factor into the relevant Korean awards and records:

* [YesAsia](http://www.yesasia.com/us/1060861261-0-0-0-en/list.html)
* [KpopTown](http://kpoptown.com/539-cd-dvd)
* [kpopmart](http://kpopmart.com/category.php?id_category=157)
* [KTown4U](http://www.ktown4u.com/eventsub?eve_no=22933&amp;biz_no=228#)
* [Korean Mall](https://koreanmall.com/app/planning/views/268/458)
* [Kpop Plus](http://kpopplus.com/32_exo)

If you wish to buy digitally from retailers based outside South Korea (like iTunes &amp; Google Play), your purchase will NOT count towards the Korean Gaon/Hanteo charts, only your country's charts ([Source](https://onehallyu.com/topic/330894-does-buying-page-two-on-itunes-count-to-sales/)).  You should be able to digitally buy (and stream) from a SK based one and have it count towards Gaon/Hanteo, but most of these distributors are in Korean, no English websites.  This is the main reason why most i-fans buy a physical instead of digital, especially during comeback season.  Digital retailers listed below that count towards the Gaon/Hanteo (all Korean):

* [Bugs](http://music.bugs.co.kr/artist/80155940?wl_ref=list_tr_10_search)

##Why Lay Isnt Promoting with EXO (&amp; Why its Not Lays or SMs Fault)

Im only adding this section because even now after many weeks, there still seems to be a ton of misinformation all over the web on why Lay isnt in this comeback, and people blaming Lay and SM for it.  To be fair, a lot of this is nuanced and only obvious if ones paying attention to international news beyond kpop. To set the record straight, heres all the info we know and what we can accurately infer from observing the powers that be.  Special thanks to L-ia &amp; Lay stans on EXOcord for the write up.

&gt; **LAY'S SITUATION**: As we all know, Lay is unable to take part in EXO's upcoming comeback. Official statements have told us he is unable to take part because of his Chinese schedules, but political tensions between China and Korea over THAAD have severely limited his Korean activities since February.

&gt; **WHAT IS THAAD?**: THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is an anti-missile system intended to protect South Korea from North Korea. China states it opposes THAAD due to its ability to track and spy the Chinese military.

&gt; **HOW DOES THIS AFFECT LAY?**: Unfortunately, it means he's stuck between in a rock and a hard place. If he promotes with EXO in Korea, he angers his Chinese fans, is seen as a traitor to his home by the Chinese general public, and his career in China would be nonexistent. This also will greatly affect EXO's career in China if he is labeled this way. If he promotes solo in China, EXO fans see him as a traitor to EXO.

&gt; **HOW COME NCT'S/SEVENTEEN'S/etc CHINA LINE ARE ABLE TO PROMOTE IN KOREA?**: Lay has a significant foothold in the Chinese market that SM has been trying to break into for years, and in addition to that he currently holds an ambassador position from his home province. Other idols simply do not have the status that Lay has in China. Additionally, SM wants him promoting in China if he cant be with EXO in SK (because SM gains a percentage of all his studios profits).

&gt; **BUT I SAW LAY IN KOREA FOR 2 DAYS**: Yes, he was in Korea in late June, during which it was announced that he would not participate in the comeback. We assume that he had attended meetings with SM on how to proceed with his schedules in the light of THAAD. SM can't foresee when political tensions will fade, so this decision had to be made.

I hope that clears up the major confusion surrounding all of this.  With all of that said, if anyone starts asking again about Lay, or accusing him of being disloyal or leaving EXO without any good evidence, I advise you all to direct that person to this post (which will stay stickied on the sub for the next several weeks).  I understand why many people would be nervous and scared about Lays future with EXO, since some of this seems to look like what happened right before Tao left.  

Please keep an eye open on the bigger picture: SK has an Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to protect themselves in defense of an attack from North Korea.  China feels that it challenges their interests in the area.  As a part of their South Korean boycott to enact economic pressure on SK, they enacted a Hallyu ban on SK. And while the new SK president is against THAAD it is a delicate political situation involving not just South Korea, but several major world powers (China, the United States of America, Russia, Japan), so at this time we just need to be patient.

OKAY, I think I hit everything important.  We are as ready for comeback as we can be which is not at all HAHAHA! ^hold ^^me

&gt;NOTE:

&gt;The Korean term   (abbrev  in short for As expected (note the first consonant) 

&gt;EXOs hangul name also begins with  :  (note the first consonant) 

&gt; is the hangul equivalent of the sound L in english, hence  would mean EXO-L!

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War/Ko Ko Bop comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of this month, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.

We are up almost 85 new subscribers!  For those who are new: WELCOME!  This is the Casual Conversation, a place where any and all discussion happens, whether EXO/kpop related or no.  It's also the ideal place to introduce yourself, if you are feeling comfortable to do so.  

This album, guys, *this. album.* Additionally, I cannot wait for Knowing Brothers to get subbed.  I keep seeing gif sets on Tumblr and it's making me so impatient I NEED IT NOW

You can add the info about the lights as a comment too if you forget to add it in the title!  We had this request from subscribers and would like to make everyone comfortable!

**Quick Titling Change**

Just a reminder!  If a performance has flashing lights we would like post titles to have """" in the [PERFORMANCE/] as a heads up in case someone is sensitive to it. You can add the info about the lights as a comment too if you forget to add it in the title!  We had this request from subscribers and would like to make everyone comfortable!

Questions will be posted every other day and we invite everyone to participate!  Some of the questions will be similar to our last W.A.O. discussions, and we have news ones for you as well - including this starter!

**1.  What is your favourite EXO moment???**

Does it have to be a monumental moment in EXO history?  (Like that first win?)  No! Just something involving EXO that you love! (Maybe a hilarious or touching interview, Chanyeol's badgering of the @weareone.exo Instagram).  Add your's here!  I have to think about mine and add it to the comments.

Also if you have an idea for a question, you can always message the mods!",8,9

&gt; A case of dyed pink hair, an argument with *la madre*, and a freak encounter with an EXO member in the park after being hit in the head by a plate finds Leigh Lee on a plane to Seoul the next day, with little recollection of how she got there and EXOs maknae intent on calling her *hyung*. Shes also clutching Luhans passport, missing her own, and widely mistaken for the second oldest *boy* in the group when she doesnt speak a word of Chinese. And to make matters worse, Luhans happily waltzed off to China  *without* permission and *with* Leighs phone  and expects her to fill in for him without being caught while he tries to hunt down the Mafia.

&gt; It wont be for long, he said.

&gt; He needed a new dictionary.

27,2017-9-4,2017,9,4,23,6y0s2n,Casual Convo #133 + A Newbies' Guide to EXO &amp; our Subreddit!,anigym6,1504536992,"**HELLO EVERYBODY!**

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War: The Power of Music comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of the Ko Ko Bop promotions, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!

Author Description:

&gt; EXO is a unit of 9 superpowered individuals that was established by the Sanctity Mission (SM). SM, comparable to the UN of today, is a coalition of approximately 8 planets that vowed to work together to prevent threats against all of them (these 8 are formerly called League of Planets, or just the League). Each of EXOs 9 members comes from 9 different planets, the 8 of the league and the 9th one being Earth.

&gt; The mission of EXO is to patrol the boundaries of the League of Planets, protect from outsider and insider threat, and to report to the SM council. We begin our journey with EXO just having received a transmission from their member Yixing, who acts as their representative in the SM, that they need to prepare themselves for a very strong threat.

&gt; This is a LIVE fic set (actively releasing small chapters, characters accepting Q&amp;A based on current storyline, texts &amp; personality updates, etc.) in a universe in which EXO has powers and is in the process of attempting to save the world, with a few side gigs.

71,2017-9-11,2017,9,11,2,6z9p84,Casual Convo #134 + An Encore of A Newbies' Guide to EXO &amp; our Subreddit!,anigym6,1505065865,"**HELLO EVERYBODY!**

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War: The Power of Music comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of the Ko Ko Bop promotions, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!

As the title says above, we are looking for **at least** two EXO-Ls for our moderation team! 

Below is our list of qualities we want in a moderator who we will be working closely with.

**You MUST:**

* Be subscribed to /r/EXO
* Active on /r/EXO
* Knowledgeable of our current rules, *but* is very willing and interested in taking on rule development (and redesign) in the near future.
* Team player
* LOVE EXO, both former and current members! We are an OT12 sub, therefore you need to be supportive and respectful of all of the guys.

And although not necessary, these next skills would be a tremendous help in the improvement and reliability of our sub. Please do not be deterred by the following list. These are NOT requirements, and will in no way lean against you in the decision to become a mod.

* People in the eastern hemisphere that will increase mod availability when other mods aren't normally around
* Language skills (Speaks/reads Korean, Mandarin and/or Japanese)
* Web design and coding experience, particularly CSS (if you've got Reddit code experience, even better)
* An interest in maintaining our wiki - especially managing the Extended Video Masterlist.

So, if you've got everything on our must list and are interested, message the mods (or comment below) and let us know what you can bring to the /r/EXO table! This post will be up and open for 2 weeks (until November 12). One of us will message you back to schedule a live chat via discord with you.

Also, for those not interested in the position but would still like to leave feedback or suggest improvements on our sub, go ahead and comment below your thoughts! After all... YOU are necessary to the growth and activity of this sub. YOUR input in major issues is always a good thing, and more opinions are always better.

47,2017-11-15,2017,11,15,16,7d2hzv,(171114) EXOs D.O. Opens Up About His Love For Acting And Cooking For His Members (soompi.com),filamjam,1510730618,"Source: [Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/2017/11/14/exos-d-o-opens-love-acting-cooking-members/)
&gt; EXO member D.O. was recently featured alongside his Room Number 7 co-star Shin Ha Kyun in a pictorial and interview for Magazine M, where he opened up about his latest roles, acting, and hobbies.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; D.O.s character in the film, Tae Jung, is a young man in his 20s struggling to survive in society. He is naive, but desperate enough to get involved with drugs and gangs for money to pay off his debts.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; D.O.s life as a popular idol and actor is worlds away from Tae Jungs harsh version of reality, but D.O. said he could still relate to his character. I havent realistically [had those problems myself], but since I started life out in society early for my age, I know the feelings of frustration, said D.O. He also revealed that his personality is similar to Tae Jungs in how he keeps things to himself and prefers to observe rather than lead.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; Tae Jung has the phrase, There is no need to try so hard to satisfy everyone, tattooed onto the back of his neck. D.O. said he came up with the idea of his characters tattoo during discussions with the director and added, It fit really well with Tae Jung.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; D.O. has been appearing non-stop in films since appearing in Cart in 2014. He explained, I have a lot of ambition for acting. I discovered a fun aspect of life through acting. I get surprised when I notice my emotions changing and maturing whenever Im doing a project. I feel a lot for the characters that I play. When I acted out Tae Jung, I imagined his past, thought about how difficult it mustve been for him, and understood him more. I hope that as I gain more experience, I will be able to better express my change in emotions. The EXO member also explained that he finds it hard to give up any roles that pique his interest.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; When the interviewer asked him about his short hair and if it was for his upcoming film Swing Kids (literal translation), D.O. answered, I have filmed six scenes. I am playing the role of a North Korean who falls in love with tap dancing. Im currently learning how to tap dance and its really fun. Its different from memorizing stage choreography. Its almost like playing the drums with your feet and feels like Im learning a new instrument.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; The EXO member named films Birdman and Cast Away as the most recent and favorite films hes watched respectively, and shared that he goes to the movies late at night when there arent people around. Outside of performing and acting, D.O. expressed how he has a love for cooking as his hobby.
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; I like making and eating delicious food, and people around me like eating my cooking too. These days, Im good at cooking fish. A few days ago, I invited all the EXO members and made them braised pomfret, fried rice, grilled short rib patties, and clam soup, revealed D.O.",0,46

XOXO - Repackage
Love Me Right
The War - Power of Music

But I Realised I can't Buy XOXO, because I would need both Korean and Chinese Version, because Exo-K &amp; Exo-m

&gt; Since he can remember, Chanyeol has felt this indescribable Itch under his skin; always nagging -urging him to do something. Creeping and crawling up his spine and digging itself into the back of his skull. But he had no idea what it meant or why he was plagued by it.

&gt; Until he met Kris.

It's your friendly neighborhood mod Kelsey here, aka the chick who does the sub banners!  Well, the chick who USED to do the sub banners, because after this post I will be officially stepping down as a moderator of /r/EXO.

TBH, this isn't quite how I imagined leaving, especially after 2.5 years.  However for a variety of personal reasons and timing, I know I can't push off this decision anymore.  Not that I still don't adore EXO, but I'd rather my adoration feel more like a fun hobby I can indulge in when I choose to.  Unfortunately, modding really doesn't allow for that.

However, it's not all doom and gloom!  /u/99101004 aka Jamie, our former moderator, is back on the ticket, and will be bringing in a whole team of long standing subbies to run this puppy to its fullest potential!  They have a real vision on how this subreddit can function, and I can't wait to see the results of their efforts.

Thank you all, every one of you, for coming here and making this place what it is, and for giving me an absolutely fantastic 2.5 years as your mod!  &lt;3

As you may have seen in our [Casual Convo thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7hf1l7/exol_casual_convo_144/) this week, /u/anigym6 has decided to step down as mod after 2.5 years on the sub. We are all very sad to see her leave, but the new team is very excited to get started on helping build r/exo back-up. 

You may know me already from the subs discord server or as a previous mod on r/exo under the username *jamiepiper*. But if you dont know me then, Hi! I am Jamie and I own the exo [discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) better known as exocord and my ult bias is Xiumin. I discovered exo during the CMB era and since than I have been an active member in the exo fandom community, trying to meet and expose more people to exo. I wont spend too much time on myself as I would like to officially introduce you all to your new moderators below. 

I have thought very carefully about who I wanted to join me on this team to help on the sub, some of them you may recognize more from this subreddit and others you may know more from our [discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP). But I guarantee you that they are all active members of the fandom who are Mods and Managers from exocord who all do a great amount of work on things like master lists, welcoming people and organizing group watches. Also they all love exo a lot, so I guess that is a bonus. 

#Welcome to all our new mods~

**/u/mochismyeon**  Hi! My name is Ang and Im thankful to help the mods and be apart of this team on r/exo, I will also be working on keeping all of exos variety up to date! Ive known about exo since 2014, but actively joined the fandom during the Call Me Baby era. If you happen to see me on exocord, I am (usually) actively talking about my love for [mochi cheeks](https://78.media.tumblr.com/836fef68c090eb12941eb30697cc9de6/tumblr_inline_ovqq96ZDrc1uip2hn_540.gif) and the occasional screams for shinee + various other groups that I love. 


**/u/carinabon** Hey guys! Im Carina, I am really excited to mod here at r/exo. I love Park Chanyeol, especially his big reactions and his genuine words. I found out about exo through Roommate when Chanyeol was on the show during Overdose era. I currently am a Manager on the EXO discord. Im also a big Red Velvet &amp; Seventeen fan and cant wait to get to know you all! 

**/u/joyceberry** Hi everyone! Im Joyce, and Im super excited to help moderate r/exo. Im an active member and local class clown of exocord, so I really look forward to helping manage the subs content and discussion. I discovered EXO around Love Me Right era, and have never looked at Yankee hats the same since. My bias is Xiumin, and Im also a huge f(x) and Seventeen fan! If you ever need advice, photo card referencing, or general shenanigans, my DMs are always open :) 

**/u/ladidalia** Hi all! Some of you may know me as Lia and one of the mods over at the Discord server (: Ive been a casual EXO fan for ages, but finally fell down this glorious rabbit hole during the Monster/Lucky One era with Lay stealing my [heart.](http://i.imgur.com/Z5dHuBT.gif) Im always open to talk about anything ranging from Kpop to makeup/skincare so dont be afraid to say hi! Im looking forward to help put with r/exo!


**/u/fringeoflife** Hi! Im Megan. r/exo helped me get into the fandom a little over a year ago and exocord pulled me down further. Chanyeol has had me ever since I watched him play with children on Return of Superman. Im very easily bribed by pictures/gifs of any EXO member with kids. Ill be helping update some of the master lists and making sure everyone is properly festive for EXO birthday celebrations. Im also a huge fan of Seventeen and SF9. Im always down for watch parties and excited to get started!

**/u/Xaille** Hey there ~ Im Sarah, a mod from exocord. Ive known exo since teaser era but didnt really get into them until Baekhyuns drama, [Moon Lovers](https://i.imgur.com/iBzyNCh.gif) came out. Baekhyuns the guy I could never get rid of so I ended up ulting him. Ill mostly be in charge of Instagram updates, the Exocord Photo Collection Master list and helping out with the subs banners. Im a graphic designer that loves to game and eat food. My inbox is always open, so feel free to ask any questions or just chat away!

**/u/Kerthiya** Hello! Im Shana. Ive been into Exo since teaser era. My bias is Kris and Im really excited to be a mod here on r/exo. Ill be doing updates about Kris, Luhan and Tao for the most part and working on the Advertising Master list to get it up to date and keeping everyone updated on the newest cfs. [I like to help people spend their money on exo fan goods :)](https://i.imgur.com/7PNU164.gif) 


**/u/wistfulove** Heyo! Some of you may know me as Wist :) I've been a part of this fandom and this sub for 3 years now and am happy to be able to be more involved. My bias is [Baekhyun](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DevotedAlarmingConch-max-1mb.gif) and Im quite active on twitter and our discord chat if anyone wants to chat :3 I will be doing our fandom discussions like Throwback Thursdays and Fandom Fridays. If anyone has ~~[rude](https://78.media.tumblr.com/5ea1099ebcce0114caefd72e53df021e/tumblr_omlbw0377p1us89nho3_500.gif)/[soft](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uiO97x0POuM/Vu67oINvNjI/AAAAAAAAG00/oEJYUzBeM2k/w265-h353-n/xiubaek%2Bgif%2Bbackhugging%2B2.gif) gifs, exo pouting pictures, and exo pan pictures~~ fan art, fan fic, or videos to recommend feel free to let me know!

#Sub Feedback &amp; Discussion

On another note, we want to make it known that we will not be making any immediate changes to the sub, so do not panic! We currently have a lot of ideas on things we would love to do over the next few months to help improve the subreddit but after long discussions on this, our biggest concern was hearing from the community first before we put anything into action.

So here is your time to have a say in the future of r/exo! Please let us know in the comments below or by filling out this [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/avuj9xLo0xFOx9Ch2) if there is anything you would like to see tweaked, changed or even added on the sub. If you are unsure, here are some things to think about:

* Is there something you wish we were doing more of as a community? 
* Is there anything you would like to see more of like Group Watches, Discussion Threads, etc? 
* Is there something in the rules that has always bugged you and was hoping to get adjusted? 
* Are there master lists and other resources that you wish we had?

Again, we are so happy to be joining the community again as mods and look forward to hearing what everyone has to say! Please do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have or give the smallest (or biggest) feedback.

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and Im super excited to bring you r/EXOs CC #145! I feel like quite the [Lucky One](https://78.media.tumblr.com/e6724119b3c7fa64e4c09ddb4bc279bb/tumblr_o8gkzxfpJa1sb2ekfo1_500.gif). I just want to introduce myself again and say that I am very excited to introduce a new phase of CC for the sub. Ill do my best to keep you guys updated on fandom trends, remind you of upcoming events (so we can squeal about how excited we are), and starting with CC #146, help manage our new-and-improved selling threads! [Ooooh fancy~](https://media1.tenor.com/images/78bc8846c49dbb016a23622e18f5bc2e/tenor.gif?itemid=5288904) But really, the main point is to have you guys talking and telling us about whats going in your life, whether it be k-pop related or not! 

Since you made it this far, theres a little bit of homework to help us all get to know each other a little better :) Please comment with your name, bias, and what Harry Potter house you think youd be in. For bonus points ^that ^dont ^exist, you can include the house you think your bias would be in. If you dont like Harry Potter, thats okay! [We still want you to comment](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2fb6db056bc226cd39ad3bdbf5b93d93/tumblr_oti3v0jN6p1s3z68no1_500.gif) hahaha~

There is a lot to come so please buckle up because [its going down, down baby](https://pa1.narvii.com/6528/7020cc6db96bac3ac697de33bf8bf993654b0b77_hq.gif).

As a final note, Id like to advertise our subs Discord server! Its essentially a chatroom with a lot of cool functions, and of course, tons of EXO-L. If you dont know what that means, you can read all about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/index/discord) or [just click this to join us](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP). Hope to see you there! 

Thank you for reading,

---------------------------------

#Sub Updates

Since we have revamped the rules, title formatting, flair system, and much more, here is a shortened highlight reel of the changes weve been making! All elaborate rules can be found in full [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).

###Sub Activities

* **Casual Convo** - Going to become a bi-weekly pin with more conversation. Mods will be in there a lot keeping conversations going and discussing social happenings in the fandom. We miss our lively community!
* **Throwback Thursday** - This will become a monthly open discussion that will be posted 5 days before the first Friday of the month, when we will host a 'Throwback Night' to group watch videos together - a lot will be based around the content that gets posted throughout the week by subbies! 
* **Fandom Friday** - This will also become a bi-weekly thread that will be more submission-based, discussing cool things everyone saw that week rather than strictly mod recommendations.
* **ICYMI** - In case you missed it threads! Mods will be posting ICYMI threads on the days of BIG events like concerts or award shows. YouTube playlists will be made with collections of fancams that people will be able to add to. These can act like your one-stop-shop access pass to the event if your alarm didn't go off that morning ;) 
* **Galaxy Bazaar** - This will be a monthly thread filled with subbies buying, trading, sellings, as well as cool group orders. Dont know what a group order is? Just wait, and all will be revealed~ The name will be changing to ***Ex'actly the Right Price: r/EXO Buy, Trade + Sell thread*** 


###Submission Titles
Weve made adjustments to our titling format and flair system to ensure that our subbies can more easily share content! We intend for it to be more easy and relaxed, as the purpose is to spread information and recent happenings quickly. Weve lined out everything for you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_title_format) but if you have any questions, please dont hesitate to message the mods and ask! Any and all feedback is appreciated.

###Submission Rules
1. **Use Stage Names in Titles:** Don't forget, we were all new to EXO at one point! In order to help people learn the members, please make sure you are using the boys stage names from SM when posting and titling new content. This will make it easier for new fans to identify members more easily, as well as improve the subs search/archive. Feel free to use real names while commenting.
1. **No Clickbait Content:** No links to koreaboo, allkpop, asian junkie, onehallyu or buzzfeed are allowed. These sites are run on clickbait titles that are misleading, and typically rumors. Please message the mods for approval if there is something you think **needs** to be posted from one of these types of websites.
1. **No Repeat Posts:** Take a quick look before you submit to see if the content you are submitting has already been posted.
1. **Raw + Subbed Videos:** Before posting an English Subbed video please double check to see if the raw version of the video has been posted already. **(A)**  If it has been posted, please make a comment with the English Subbed video and mods will change the flair letting people know the English Sub is now available. **(B)** If there is no Raw version already posted, please post it with the flair ""VIDEO (ENG SUB)""
1. **No Rumors:** Please avoid posting rumors until there are official statements made from SM, EXO, or any of the members official studios. 
1. **Fan Work + Humor/Meme/Crack Content:** Are you an artist, writer, or video editor and want to share your work? We want to see it! Please post in one of our dedicated Fandom threads as a comment rather than a new post by itself.
1. **Selling + Trading Goods:** If you are selling EXO goods, please do not make an individual post about this, instead put it in our selling threads.

We will be keeping the [Google form open](https://goo.gl/forms/avuj9xLo0xFOx9Ch2) just in case there is anything you would like to see tweaked, changed or added to the rules and sub in general.",44,7

* **SPOILER:** [The unreleased half of Electric Kiss was playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/byunificial/status/944080952384294912)
* **SPOILER:** [Unheard/unreleased Song playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/chenkunsuki/status/944085763511042049), we are thinking its Track #7 from the album: ""Lovin You Mo""
* **SPOILER:** [Unheard/unreleased Song playing outside the venue](https://twitter.com/michen92/status/944074497749016576), we are thinking this is another part from Track #7 from the album: ""Lovin You Mo""
* **MEET &amp; GREET** Each show will have a small meet &amp; greet for only 30 people who will get a special venue copy of Countdown (when it comes out), todays show's meet &amp; greet was Baekhyun, Chanyeol, Chen &amp; D.O! 
* **SET LIST** I haven't heard anything yet saying that the set list was changed, so it should still be the same as [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPjCfmGUEAA2NPN.jpg) (but all the original Japanese songs that were sung in Korean at Elyxion in Seoul, were sung in Japanese for these shows) 

#171222 EyXiOn

[Here is a thread of translations](https://twitter.com/byunificial/status/944131430359080960) from the show (I am going to do some highlights from it below, all credit does to byunificial:

* EXO had a screen inside the venue for Jonghyun that said: ""Jonghyun sunbaenim, who had always shined brightly on the stage with his passion-filled music has left our side. The reality that we cannot be with him anymore is heartbreaking. A true artist, Jonghyun sunbaenim. We miss you and love you so much. We will remember you forever. - EXO"" [1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRpC3aUVoAAEfSn.jpg) [2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRpDtv2UMAEYRlj.jpg)
* Suho said the back of kyungsoo's head looks like a microphone. 
* Chanyeol was speaking in Japanese about how the tension of the concert was high today, and he suddenly couldn't think of what to say next so he said 'uhhh...' and then the rest of the [members began harmonizing](https://twitter.com/byunergy/status/944208269202952193) [**(LIKE OLD TIMES)**](https://twitter.com/hotvscuteyeol/status/944195821087744000)
* Baekhyun asked everyone: Are you hungry? I am too. We are going to eat curry when we get back to our hotel. Eat curry today, everyone! Let's eat together '' Ah-ah. I'm not telling you where! **(FLIRT)**
* They dedicated Into Your World/Angel to Jonghyun. Suho said: Before our last stage, we want to discuss something with you all. Jonghyun was a friend, a hyung, a producer to EXO &amp; has recently passed away. Not only us, but I am sure many of you are hurting inside. For our beloved Jonghyunnie, we will now perform 'Into Your World.'
* During 'Into Your World', Chanyeol shouted out Jonghyun's name, something about being happy together that I didn't manage to catch. 

Some other cute Fan Accounts:

Welcome to our new-and-improved buy/trade/sell thread, where you can comfortably spend your money and gush over pretty merchandise. These will be going up monthly, so you can be sure theres always going to be something new to catch your eye! Feel free to comment about the following:

As a final note, Id like to quickly mention group orders. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0cLMJ0i52ng5OaL0sB7hYdj_Mi5oBRseRA6tZOxoVo/edit) is a great beginner primer for group orders, which are typically hosted through Twitter. There are a few inaccuracies in here, but otherwise its a great introduction to those unfamiliar with what they are. In the future, Ill be posting a few cool group orders that have been catching my eye or seem popular with EXO-L. 

Again, please remember our disclaimer and exercise caution before sending money to anyone. Check their account activity, their posted proofs, how they treat others, etc. This weeks chosen GO is for [lightstick accessories](https://twitter.com/berryyeol/status/939982517771239424) in light of the current and upcoming concerts!

This year instead of it being just a general 'wish' project, the focus was actually around showcasing Chinese traditional cultural and folk customs to youth who may not know about them. He partnered up with Director Zhang Jing who made extremely beautiful mini films focusing on different handicrafts around China. See the extremely beautiful content below!

I've never worried about authenticity before since all the signatures I own I've gotten directly from mwave. However I know they don't sell SM artists and have been searching tirelessly for an EXO signature or even just a Baekhyun signature and have come across a lot of what I deem to be fakes just from studying their autographs from fan signings and stuff. 

However, in my searching I came across a [post](http://cafarnaumbox.blogspot.com/2016/02/list-of-sellers-selling-genuine-signed.html) of ""legit sellers"" and the author of the post said that most of exo's signed albums, even when legit, are signed actually by exo's managers and not by exo members themselves. This was my first time hearing this and I was wondering if this was known to be true? In case the day never comes where I can get a fansign signature myself I feel getting my hands on a signed promo is my best bet, and it would feel really bad to spend that much money on something the boys never even had any part of. I will say that the author of the post is a bts fan so idk how she would know exo's signature methods so well, but I didn't become interested in signed albums til very recently, so it could be something well known in our fandom that I overlooked. So I was hoping someone here would know better than me :)

Thanks!! ",3,1

Ship: Baekhyun x Chanyeol  
AU: Artist!Baekhyun AU, Modern day  
Rating: Teen and Up Audiences  
Status: Complete  
Description: It is later, and Chanyeol regrets this a lot. Baekhyun is stumbling around the bar, spilling his drink on strangers and trying to dance, but the dancing is more like awkward swaying and doing just that is hard enough for him to manage without falling over, hes already that drunk, and its not even eight.

D.O. has had a big year. Weve seen him in the movies Room No. 7 and in Along With the Gods: Two Worlds. He won a boatload of awards (mostly for his role in the 2016 film My Annoying Brother) including the Baeksang award for Most Popular Actor (Film), Blue Dragon Film Award for Best New Actor, JIMFF Star Award, Korean Film Shining Star Newcomer Award, and the Asia Artist Awards Popularity Award for actor. 


AND OF COURSE all his activities with EXO as well. 


Heres a little trip down memory lane

Its the day of birth of our soft, squishy dancing machine!!! Kai, we love you so much and hope you have an amazing year and laugh a lot and are on 100000 more magazine covers. 


Kais solo dances have always been some serious show stoppers and this past year was no exception. Both [EyXiOn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXh3CgfYj7c&amp;ab_channel=Mr.Destiny) and [EXOrDIUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWDhmAMw4k) had beautiful Kai solos where I had to remind myself to breathe.

[He's also managed to find a way make the Touch It choreo cute and dangerous at the same time? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDiVdCCZF0) [Power choreo had the same effect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66wSZKzlxJs) 

This was also the year of Model Kai. Including group shoots, he was on the cover of or in something like 23 magazines!?!?!

And let's not forget his lead role as Lee Shi-kyung in the KBS drama Andante and his upcoming Japanese drama Spring has Come.

Kai, you've shown us just how multi-talented you are this year and every second of it has been amazing. Thank you for everything. Happy birthday bub!

I hope everyone had a great beginning to 2018! I've spent the beginning of the year in far too cold of temperatures, but that's okay, because there's nothing quite like curling up under a blanket and watching some fancams...or concerts...or dance practices...or all 3 for hours upon hours...

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #148! 

We are well into 2018 and of course, EXO are having a great time. Tao [released a new single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q_3tQuZ3g0), Chanyeol is [currently taking over Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeANWAVHT5z/?taken-by=real__pcy), CurlyHun is [somehow cuter than ever](https://twitter.com/milkteu/status/954706352147804160), and Yixing has been making waves for his [strict judging](https://twitter.com/IdolProdSubs/status/954268878766358529) in Chinas Idol Producer. The Twitter memes were glorious, and people have been praising [Yixing (and Taemin as well)](https://twitter.com/kimtaem/status/948963810081165312) for their judging abilities as it gives insight into how difficult their own training was. 

One of the most powerful recent moments is of course, Power being played at the famous Dubai Fountain! [Here](https://vimeo.com/251414481) is the super-cool video of the official water choreography! I didnt cry watching this. Nope..[not even once](https://m.popkey.co/602be2/rzqKX.gif) 

EXO-L,  what have you been up to these days? How are your New Years resolutions panning out? Can anyone explain to me how to [stop listening to Been Through](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/8e/58/838e581023a35eeb7492aa7838480f5f.gif) on repeat for hours?

Welcome to **Ex'actly the Right Price: r/EXO Buy, Trade + Sell Thread #2**! Just as reminder of what these threads are for, subbies are free to comment the following:

1. Items youre selling, photo/price are preferred (but optional)

1. Items youre looking to trade, and for what.
1. Items youre looking to buy 
1. Tips for great deals, group orders, or rare merch (links to Twitter, eBay, etc. are allowed but within reason, please dont spam)
1. Giveaways or free items 

These rules apply to both official and fanmade merchandise!
 
Shana (/u/Kerthiya) and I have compiled a small amount of group orders on Twitter that people might be interested in. This is in no way comprehensive, just a tiny taste of the different items available. People do group orders for slogans, calendars, notepads, apparel, SUM Cafe goods, and so much more!

For probably too long, if I'm being absolutely honest...

So I am curious, what are your fave dramas or movies an exo member has participated in?

    

Let me start with a couple of fan favourites~

Everybody should watch [Moon Lovers](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f1/fd/c9/f1fdc94c024281dd6af19c6d4bdf964b.jpg) - Baekhyun you have my heart. [Waaaaah so absolutely handsome](https://78.media.tumblr.com/686c54f7a9cdb4886eccbf754747e503/tumblr_odgd7n2M7K1r9f1l9o2_400.gif)~. Also what a dumb, [the absolute sweetest boy for not eating the cucumbers](https://youtu.be/xtvK35NNsfw?t=1m3s)

 

[Falling For Do Jeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRw8CfSfF68&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN), mostly because of this entire OST (thank you Xiumin) - a very beautiful web drama!


 
I will finish this by talking about D.O.

Pure Love. Probably **the** best movie I have ever seen in my life. No exaggeration. If you haven't, I recommend this movie and I hope it lands to the very top of your list of what to watch next. [Please watch this movie, but bring tissues](https://pa1.narvii.com/6464/38c77756546741bb13bcb4684ff1e955fd60489d_hq.gif)

208,2018-1-29,2018,1,29,8,7to09y,"r/EXO's Monthly Throwback Discussion + Group Watch Night: February 2nd, 2018!",wistfulove,1517181792,"Here's a wonderful welcome and explanation that Jamie posted last month for our new throwback discussions!

&gt;Welcome to the updated Throwback Thursday thread! These events/threads are a great way for new fans to learn about older amazing things that happened~

&gt;**ABOUT**   
We heard your feedback and decided that this thread would work better as a monthly open discussion + group watch instead of a weekly post. Every month it will be posted 5 days before the first Friday of the month, when we will host a 'Throwback Night' to group watch videos together - a lot will be based around the content that gets posted throughout the week by subbies!

&gt;**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**  
Easy! Start by sharing some of your favourite throwbacks below in a comment with a link~ If you are having troubles thinking of things, why not think about your favourite award show/end of the year performances from the past! Or if you are new to the fandom, ask a question, like ""hey, I really like Chanyeol, what are some great things he has done in the past?"" and than the community can send you great things like this.

&gt;The mods will then gather throwbacks together and create a playlist for us to watch together on Friday Feb 2nd.

&gt;**THE GROUP WATCH**  
When: Friday Feb 2nd  
Time: Starting around 9PM EST --&gt; [Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180106T020000&amp;p1=250&amp;p2=224&amp;p3=70&amp;p4=749&amp;p5=136&amp;p6=333&amp;p7=145&amp;p8=235&amp;p9=47&amp;p10=240)  
How long will it last: These group watches are typically between 2-5 or so hours long. Its totally open so just drop in whenever you feel and see if anyone is there.  
Where: [Cytube](https://cytu.be/r/exocord)

We're super excited to see you guys there! I personally found so many unseen videos and made a lot of friends through these group watches, so we hope you can all attend!

Hi Everyone! Its Carina, your friendly neighbourhood mod. I hope you guys had a wonderful week! Here is [r/exo]( https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/)'s Casual Convo #149!  

I think everyone should take a moment to catch up with EXO on the [ICYMI]( https://twitter.com/i/moments/954414330493124608) thread! Thank you Jamie for taking the time to compile it all. 

We also had The EyXiOn in Saitama this week, if you havent seen pictures and videos, do yourself a favour and peruse our ICYMI for [day 1]( https://twitter.com/i/moments/957153020814417921) and [day 2]( https://twitter.com/i/moments/957532263893295105). 

I think my favourite part of this week is a tie between [Electric Kiss being performed on Sukkiri]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ieEIz94V0) and the Dubai video we got on [vlive]( http://www.vlive.tv/video/56745) 

EXO-L, do you have any favourite moments from this week? Tell us about your week!

Ive seen a couple fan accounts saying how dance line is so much more sharper and precise in person than on video - saying a camera does it no justice, do you agree?

Hi Guys! Carina here.  Hope yall had a great week! Here is [r/exo]( https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/)'s Casual Convo #150!  150!!! WOW! 

I think everyone should take a moment to catch up with EXO on the [ICYMI]( https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7uuijh/180127180202_icymi_exo_weekly_news_updates/ ) thread! Jamie makes life so much easier with these!

We also had Nature Republics Green Nature EXO Fan Festival this week, if you havent seen pictures and videos, do yourself a favour and check out our [ICYMI](https://twitter.com/i/moments/959790454395908097) 

I think my favourite part of this week was the trailer for Taos new drama, [Negotiator]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrx_4v63BJk) It looks so good! I cant wait! 

What are you guys up to this week? Anything youre looking forward to from EXO?

Edit: Kris is actually doing good in China. He has stated before that he wanted to take part in the music production for EXO but we all know that that didnt end well. SM only recently let members write lyrics. 

Im no music expert but I think producing is entirely different than writing/lyric composition. I brought up this question because of [an article](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7941809/exos-the-war-song-by-song-breakdown-band-producers) Ive read on how the album The War came out to be.

Wondering what EXO has been up to this week, click through to the [ICYMI](https://twitter.com/i/moments/959791774259601408/) thread! 


This week EXO was in Taipei for The EyXiOn, if you havent seen all the highlights, click through for pictures and video compiled by our lovely Jamie.  [The EyXiOn in Taipei Day 1](https://twitter.com/i/moments/962386081084669952) and

Such as adopting an animal from WWF, planting trees or donating to charity. A lot of the members fans do things like this every year, for example Chen's fans have been planting a forest of trees every year on his birthday and Xiumins fans tend to donate to charities like the Global Multicultural Welfare Association or donating to Childrens funds to help with different various ailments. 

Bringing this over to our [exo discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP) first brought lot of support, and we wanted to officially invite everyone of [r/exo](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/) to participate as well!



**EXOcord + r/EXOs BIRTHDAY GIFTS FOR EXO PROJECT**

For each EXO member we will be offering 3 different charities to choose from, and you will vote on which one you would like/have most interest in donating to. We want to offer different charities from across the world that showcase each members personalities as best as possible (so sky is the limit!). If you have any ideas for particular members, send me or [/u/99101004](https://www.reddit.com/user/99101004) a message!

For the months that have multiple member birthdays, ie. Sehuns and Luhans birthdays are both in April - we will offer three charities in total to choose from. We will evenly distribute the donations to the charity of choice (half under Sehuns name and half under Luhans) at the end of the month.



**XIUMINS BIRTHDAY PROJECT**

Since Xiumin's birthday is just a little over a month away we want to discuss the charities and begin donations. 



&gt; Please vote for ONE charity below that you would like to donate to [here](https://goo.gl/forms/9p5wCMvoQBfTmMTk1). If you have already voted on our [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP) page there is no need to do it twice!

* One Warm Coat https://www.onewarmcoat.org/aboutus/

One Warm Coat is a national non-profit organization that works to provide a free, warm coat to any person in need.

* Coffee Kids https://www.coffeekids.org/

Coffee Kids empowers young coffee farmers to create thriving businesses and a sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families.

* World Wildlife Fund https://www.worldwildlife.org/ 

Our mission is to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. 



Our donation pool is already open! 

If you are comfortable with donating (even $1 is helpful!) our donation pool is already open on PayPal. You can donate up until March 25th, as we will be donating what we have received to the charity under Xiumin's name with the most votes on this day.


https://paypal.me/pools/c/81LR0gg5Uf



If you are cautious about donating to us, we will post all receipts showing which charity we have donated to. We  have chosen to use Paypal Pool to donate to since it is against PayPal's policy to profit from this system and they can shut down the account on there if it is used incorrectly. If it is used incorrectly, the pool will automatically be shut down and the money will be returned immediately. 

Again, any question or concerns you are free to message me or [/u/99101004](https://www.reddit.com/user/99101004) - or even join our [exo discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP) to get to know us better!",13,16

If you don't know me, join our [exo discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP) and find out how much I talk about this. [CHANKAISOO](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOqOZwVV4AA4tDt.jpg) - the ultimate subunit of my dreams. Not only does ChanKai love D.O. with their entire hearts, they would work so well together as a subunit

~~Need convincing? No? Ok well I'll post them anyway because this is a whole post dedicated to my passion~~

Kai has said before that he wants to have a [duet with D.O.](https://streamable.com/d753r)!!!!! It isn't too much of a surprise that Kai picked D.O., we all know how much Kai loves Kyungsoo (really, it isn't a surprise all he does is shower him with affection)

And Chanyeol is definitely on the same page - with their duets online, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI1V23xLzpU&amp;ab_channel=EXOChanSooWeAreOne) - even D.O. being on Chanyeols soundcloud singing ['Love Yourself'](https://soundcloud.com/realpcysc/love-youselffeatdo?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=email). 

All three have such [amazing dynamic](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236311672325799946/405237708026281984/KaiSooYeol_TheEve.gif) with each other, [do I need to further explain?](https://78.media.tumblr.com/bbccd89d6b3a0d6a1797801fbb5a3aac/tumblr_orkz7tClfe1u94j5lo1_500.gif) And if we look at it from a purely outside perspective, a rapper, a vocal and a dancer would be an amazing subunit. But with Chanyeol working hard as a singer, Kai as well (the Universe album proves it) it would be my dream come true! 

^^Also ^^SM ^^please ^^stop ^^making ^^the ^^three ^^stand/sit ^^together ^^like ^^CBX ^^does, ^^my ^^poor ^^tiny ^^heart ^^can't ^^handle ^^all ^^the ^^dreaming

  

So I am very much am looking forward to reading who you would love to see in a subunit together - and don't hold back! I expect to see paragraphs~ 

Tell me who you want to see, why you would think they would work good as a subunit, go wild and tell me your dreams!",42,20

Id also like to draw **special attention** to EXOcord and r/EXOs birthday donation project for [Xiumin](http://78.media.tumblr.com/aad39e2d057ae7482145e6b6b6773318/tumblr_inline_otpm3qmsUD1sc3ygs_250.gif)! In light of more members requesting not to receive physical birthday gifts anymore (~receiving our hearts instead~), we have decided to join in on the many other EXO-L donation projects to commemorate our lovely idols and help others at the same time. All information can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7wx158/exocord_rexos_birthday_gifts_for_exo_project/).

129,2018-2-23,2018,2,23,10,7zkdoy,How did you discover EXO? Were they your first KPOP group? Do you think they made an impact on your life?,mochismyeon,1519350491,"As the Olympic closing ceremony rapidly approaches with over 5 million people to watch EXO perform, many new fans will join the EXO-L fandom. It got me curious as to when you discovered EXO and KPOP! 



The very first time I saw EXO was through tumblr way back when. A lot of people I followed became KPOP/EXO blogs and I remember being very confused of how people could keep track of 12 members all at once. Don't even get me started about how confused I was by how they wrote down dates ~~seeing a date like 120518 was so confusing. I even remember looking it up and got nothing but more questions, poor lil me~~

I don't think I *actively* joined the EXO fandom until 2017 (starting with our [exo discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP)) but tried my best to follow without Twitter or Tumblr to tell me what to start with.

EXO weren't my first KPOP group though, I can't remember which video I had seen first, but [Ring Ding Dong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roughtzsCDI&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) or [Lucifer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww9UjJ4Dt8&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) had been the first videos I have ever seen of KPOP. Today SHINee still stands to be my bias group along with EXO. 

Speaking for EXO, they have definitely made an impact in my life - they brought me into a very loving and welcoming community I didn't think I could ever find. I saw the way different way artists interacted with fans, with their members, I learned about new cultures and trends, and EXO has gotten me involved with so many things I could never imagine involved with ([like our birthday donations for EXO members](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7wx158/exocord_rexos_birthday_gifts_for_exo_project/)) and I am very grateful to many many things they have done for me.

Also a big happy hug to r/kpop for showing me the discord servers to join and because of them I discovered my favourite community and somehow fell more in love with EXO~",31,15

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #153! 

I CANT REALLY BE COHERENT THIS WEEK BECAUSE EXO PERFORMED AT THE [OLYMPICS](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/r5eMWCOMbhUxZ-oJwXGJw5fnr8EHq2iS-lGtKM3ZguBa4Yb6HZiQLVzvdIHFKHNymPz1tGOIgCG1fograODVkOh232HKqkOOjeSa7VSODwOT49rPOOpN3Hpc6r9zGQPkmJpGy1kpNA=s0-d)! Get caught up with the [EXO x Olympics ICYMI Thread](https://twitter.com/i/moments/967194833596006400)!!!!! 

In addition, I wanted to bring your attention to our latest information regarding ~~SheepWatch~~ Lay: 

&gt;**Where is Lay?** Wondering where Lay has been? We broke it down for you below, but the most important thing for you to know is, Yes, Lay is still a member of EXO.

&gt;**Lay's Situation** As we all know, Lay is unable to take part in EXO's current comebacks. Official statements have told us he is unable to take part because of his Chinese schedules, but political tensions between China and Korea over THAAD have severely limited his Korean activities since February 2017.

&gt;**What is THAAD?** THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is an anti-missile system intended to protect South Korea from North Korea. China states it opposes THAAD due to its ability to track and spy the Chinese military.

&gt;**How does this affect Lay &amp; EXO?** Unfortunately, it means he's stuck between in a rock and a hard place. If he promotes in Korea, he angers his fans, is seen as a traitor to his home, and his career in China would be nonexistent. This also will greatly affect EXO's career in China if he is labeled this way. If he promotes in China, fans see him as a traitor to EXO.

&gt;**How come NCT/SVT/etcs China Line are able to promote in Korea still?**Lay has a significant foothold in the Chinese market that SM has been trying to break into, and in addition to that he currently holds an ambassador position from his home province. Other idols simply do not have the status that Lay has in China.

&gt;**I saw Lay with CBX!** Many of you have probably seen the CBX + Lay photo by now, which signifies a step toward EXO reuniting as 9 again. However, this is not a process that will only take days, weeks, or even months because of several reasons. First, and most important, THAAD IS NOT OVER. Yes, China and Korea are taking steps to better their relations, but politics are finicky, and changes do not occur overnight. Lay has also gained traction for his solo career in China this past year due to this, and he still has predetermined schedules that he has committed to. As for EXO, they have prepared the winter album and Japanese album as 8 for months now, making it difficult for all of them to suddenly adjust to 9 members without knowing when political tensions ease. Things do seem to be moving in the right direction regarding politics, but in the meantime, however long it takes to have Lay back in EXO, the only thing to do is wait and support all the boys in their activities.

I also wanted to remind you all of r/EXO + EXOCords birthday charity donation project for Xiumin! All information can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/7wx158/exocord_rexos_birthday_gifts_for_exo_project/), please help us adopt some [adorable animals](https://pa1.narvii.com/6480/83e639369670aeaa88ab21858179af587ced9d67_hq.gif).

**ABOUT**   
Every month this thread will be posted 5 days before the first Friday of the month, when we will host a 'Throwback Night' to group watch videos together - a lot will be based around the content that gets posted throughout the week by subbies!

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**  
Easy! Start by sharing some of your favorite throwbacks below in a comment with a link~ If you are having trouble thinking of things, why not think about your favorite EXO cover or teaser from the past? Or if you are new to the fandom, ask a question, like ""hey, I really like Chanyeol, what are some great things he has done in the past?"" and then the community can send you great things like this.

The mods will then gather throwbacks together and create a playlist for us to watch together on Friday March 2nd.

**THE GROUP WATCH**  
When: Friday March 2nd  
Time: Starting around 9PM EST --&gt; [Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180106T020000&amp;p1=250&amp;p2=224&amp;p3=70&amp;p4=749&amp;p5=136&amp;p6=333&amp;p7=145&amp;p8=235&amp;p9=47&amp;p10=240)

In light of Xiumin's (and now Sehuns) recent message about no longer receiving gifts, EXOcord &amp; r/EXO has teamed up to create a Birthday Project for each EXO member that will benefit more than just the KPOP community. Going forward, for each member's birthday we will be collecting donations for a different charity of choice voted by our discord &amp; reddit members to than donate in each of the EXO member's name for their birthday.

**How it works:** For each EXO member we will be offering 3 different charities to choose from, and you will vote on which one you would like/have most interest in donating to. We want to offer different charities from across the world that showcase each members personalities (or powers!) as best as possible.

**Months with Multiple Members:** For the months that have multiple member birthdays, ie. Sehuns and Luhans birthdays are both in April - we will offer three charities in total to choose from. We will evenly distribute the donations to the charity of choice (half under Sehuns name and half under Luhans) on the member with the latest birthday in that month.

**How we collect:** We are using PayPal Pools in order to collect for these donations. A link will be posted for each PayPal pool for the different Birthday Projects. You can donate any amount (even $1 helps) at any time until the deadline date. Your name will not show on the feed, so don't worry about doxxing. If you are cautious about donating to us, we will post all receipts showing which charity we have donated to. We have chosen to use Paypal Pool to donate to since it is against PayPal's policy to profit from this system and they can shut down the account on there if it is used incorrectly. In the case that the money is used incorrectly, the pool will automatically be shut down and the money will be returned immediately. Please note, Unfortunately PayPal pools is not a tool that is available in ALL countries around the world, so if you would like to contribute and you are from one of these locations please send /u/99101004 or /u/mochismyeon a private message.

**How to vote:** We decide what charity to donate to through vote! If you are not in our [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/tD8U5VP) where voting takes place and you would still like to vote, please upvote the comments below for the Charity of Choice for each project!

WELL.

So, not to exaggerate but this is literally all I ever talk about, ever ..... 

Ask literally any person on [EXOcord](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) I am like 99.9% sure I mention Curtain at least once a day (these are actual facts) ~~and no stapler when you see this not the REMIX~~

Suho. Curtain. That is all 

Actually it isn't all I AM NEVER DONE TALKING ABOUT THIS. We have had one snippet in [Malaysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo5pxdXc0jU&amp;ab_channel=GuardianAngelSUHO) and that is probably the last time the song 'Curtain' has ever been brought up again. His sweet honey voice is so beautiful and amazing and this song is genuinely not talked about enough in terms of how amazing of a vocalist Suho is.

Junmyeon, super bunny leader of my heart and of my tiny boys EXO, if there is ever a chance you see this AS YOUR #1 SUPPORTER OF ALL THAT YOU DO - I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH PLEASE JUST SING THE FULL SONG LIVE

This being said, [stream support and love Curtain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG_xrO_7y2g&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN)



SO TELL ME R/EXO: 

What song makes you react like me on a daily basis? What did you think when you first heard this song? Tell me why you love this song so much and why it deserves more love!

These don't have to just be solos by the way! It can be a track on any EXO album or an OST you feel like it deserves more attention! Sorry if the title is a bit misleading ~~

There is also without a doubt one aegyo moment that has shattered my heart and soul from the moment it happened. I have never seen anything so cute in my entire life [please watch if you want to smile](https://youtu.be/vmBYdhJaJhE?t=2m27s). If you haven't seen EXO on knowing brothers and want to see where that amazing cuteness happened it was on episode 85 you are welcome in advance

D.O. just made me laugh with this bit of an interview he did while promoting [pls watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWmpP9jmryY&amp;ab_channel=SBSRunningMan) and this is full blown 100% aegyo without even trying good bye [I love a man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjOlfn_6WvY&amp;ab_channel=%EB%9A%9C%EB%9A%9C) ~~this is definitely my favourite moment but shh nobody has to know~~",18,17

~~But if were being honest, I don't know what to say either~~

This will probably get emotional and deep so let's just JUMP STRAIGHT INTO IT

^I ^think ^I'll ^format ^this ^as ^if ^I ^was ^actually ^saying ^it ^to ^them, ^I ^feel ^like ^it ^might ^be ^easier ^to ^phrase;


Thank you for being apart of the public eye for so long and allowing ~~blessing~~ the public to see all different beautiful sides of yourself. I know you must be constantly stressed out, speaking so carefully at all times when the public is watching and waiting for you to make a mistake. All the late night practices you do, all the events you go to, flying out back and forth and getting little to no sleep. But still having time to go on Instagram or VLIVE at 2-3 in the morning just to speak to us. 

Thank you for getting so excited to see EXO-Ls no matter where you are - how emotional, surprised and happy you are to win each and every single award, and being so respectful to those around you even after all these years. Treating every moment as if you had first debuted. 

Finally, thank you for being my happiness. I cherish every moment with you, knowing you do the exact same. I will support and love you no matter where you go and what you do. Your love and happiness mean the absolute world to me so I hope you take care of yourselves and each other, and are constantly surrounding yourself with things that make you happy. 

I [love](https://streamable.com/u8wfa) you [EXO] (https://33.media.tumblr.com/13362edac70ec145471d4143a225f8bc/tumblr_inline_nyqnnf4IAb1s6t527_500.gif) 

  

I DID SAY IT WAS GOING TO GET EMOTIONAL. So tell me, if you were to attend a fansign who would you want to talk to? What would you say to them? It can be to one bias, or two, maybe all of them? Leave no details behind!
I am expecting novels from you guys, because I know how much you all love EXO~~",16,14

This year Xiumin alongside Suho blessed us with [the most soothing documentary about Korea from above ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGEh8w0ZK-M). He debuted (again) in Japan, [this time with CBX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6m2rA8rUt4&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=harulin0326). He may be the eldest in EXO, but he's still [young and free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfbRLbMuGSs). 

We were also blessed with multiple variety shows featuring Xiumin. On It's Dangerous Outside the blankets he [jammed out to all kinds of songs while sleepily getting ready in the morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAnmaHlhZ0) and also [discovered the fun of VR games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q_kItL8_-E). Most recently he was a guest on Life Bar with fellow SM artists Changmin and Mark, and showed off [some dancing skillls](https://youtu.be/dQCLYRUaUIg?t=159) while there.

I don't have a great way of introing [this clip from EyXiOn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5EwCbllkZg) except that it leaves me without words. Main dancer Xiumin rise.

If you're a photo collector or a photo appreciator or just anybody human really, take a gander at [this collection of photos from the fansign for The War](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0S1oYbif0kDMEgyVUctb2szR2c). So many full gummy smile moments.

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #157! 

TODAY IS A VERY SPECIAL CASUAL CONVO, BECAUSE IT IS OUR MINSEOKKIES BIRTHDAY~ Our very own [xiukitty](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/9f/02/299f02c7379994a20662899efe7d4941.jpg), [xiuhamster](https://i.imgur.com/Bp6N5We.jpg), [xiusquirrel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236311672325799946/396867667723550734/8c4dd71578.gif)- whatever animal ears you put on him, hes still the very same [cutie](https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/29164827/Xiumin.png) we all love and adore. His last year has been [particularly wonderful](http://pa1.narvii.com/6368/2a9faa466b4963214c61243127bd6aafd9433197_hq.gif) for him. There is a lovely birthday [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/870c68/happy_xiumin_day_3/) up that you can read and comment at, but because this glorious day happens to fall upon my weekly column (thank you, fate and Mysterious Exoplanet Gods) and there [can never be too much love in the air for EXO](https://media.giphy.com/media/rON1W7dL0YUtq/giphy.gif), Ill be doing a ~~not-so-small~~ segment of my own :3 [Strap in and lets get to it!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/52b7de6562e5a1da5ec2e20921594874/tumblr_inline_o35v4cOdXz1sd4p8l_540.gif)

Without further ado, here are **12 highlights from Minseoks 27th year**~ (in no particular order)
                            
1. Its not a surprise that everything Minseok touches sells out. A few recent occurrences of this are **a)** MLB renaming an entire product after him just because Minseok wore it in their advertisement and fans loved it- thus, Minseoks [Legendary Acorn Bag](https://twitter.com/saminseok/status/977013153790803968) was born! **b)** He also sold out [six varieties of Suhorang dolls which represent the Pyeongchang Olympics](https://twitter.com/Morocco_EXOL/status/966478654707589120) just by being photographed buying them! **c)**Not to mention, his skincare was shown for TWO SECONDS next to him in a preview of Its Dangerous Outside The Blankets, and of course- [the entire line sold out](https://twitter.com/saminseok/status/955010166021222400).
                            

2. Minseok decided the only thing he wanted to do during Touch Its choreo was [make] (https://twitter.com/xiu_baos/status/963783524871372806) [moves](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVroZyeVoAAQ9jF.jpg) [on Suho](https://twitter.com/SuhoBr/status/970018166263992320)...please, boys, youre in public!

3. Baekhyun and Chen crowning Xiumin as the [leader of CBX](https://twitter.com/kyungsoo_stan/status/852743048911962112) and he of course filled his role as [beautiful](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwldMYnVIAAkbF-.jpg) [flower](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/0e/70/c40e70e1a87fe6a725faa2f6c8a37175.png) [boy](https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5621/30390542820_58091976b2_o.jpg) spectacularly~ Our Minseok may deny that hes the glue of CBX, but the other boys know this and constantly remind him~

4. That one time Minseok decided to [practice emotional manipulation on Sehun and Baekhyun](https://streamable.com/v2b02) at the Nature Republic Fan Festival ~~this xiubaek moment oh my GOD~~

5. [CBX](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWtN9uMU8AAjZjv.jpg) was brought to China as [guests of the South Korean President Moon Jae In](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVSN5VPXcAE7ngL.jpg), attending the Korea-China Economic Trade and Partnership event to help ease political tensions. Their presence there is an incredible honor, and brought us the now-iconic and long-awaited [reunion with Lay](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRDietfVQAArIwN.jpg).

6. A month prior to his birthday, Minseok wrote a lengthy message on the EXO-L app to let us know he would like to stop receiving physical gifts from fans because he is content with our love and support~ The [message is incredibly sweet and endearing](https://twitter.com/baekbaecon/status/960550040648400897) and I can only imagine how many more donations to charity EXO-L have done in his name since this announcement! [Xiumins fans are known to be very charitable usually](https://twitter.com/ElsaWorldwide/status/960589338235961344), so this mustve been a great boost for that. Check out the results of our very own charity project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8715r6/exocord_rexo_adopted_3_animals_from_the_wwf_and/)!

7. At the legendary [Pyeongchang Olympics performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKCKn5RhbAw) we saw our normally shy Minseok get [all up](https://78.media.tumblr.com/0ca343bf6df33eedd19dc446aff0ec25/tumblr_p4pn73X3hD1x4d0b6o1_400.gif) [in the cameras](http://78.media.tumblr.com/603d0f3870147763a82168b31811f5f2/tumblr_p4q0i8ZVNZ1tytutbo4_r2_400.gif) [face](https://78.media.tumblr.com/232d857dd26573ca6a0c1fbbb95f995b/tumblr_p4pn73X3hD1x4d0b6o2_r1_400.gif) and it couldnt be a more perfect example of how much his confidence has grown~

8. [The Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYZ17woSNMw) and [Touch It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py2CLyMzIIk) have very sensual choreos, said no one ever, at least not while watching Xiumin perform the CUTEST mini renditions of these dances at their 170813 fansign for The War. How he can do those moves and then get shy about it, I have no idea.

9. That unfortunate moment when Minseok was unknowingly cast into Team Wasabi at EXO Cup and his spirit momentarily [left his body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SMb4dNhcLU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=37)

10. This last year was definitely Xiumins Year of Variety! He was a guest on [Its Dangerous Outside The Blankets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4SZwWP5H8) and recently was announced to be a permanent returning cast member for the continuation of the show. His most recent guesting was on [Life Bar](https://twitter.com/byunificial/status/974294482509225984), where he drank and talked with popular Korean celebrities alongside TVXQs Changmin and NCTs Mark!

11. Speaking of NCTs Mark- we all know hes Minseoks favorite junior at SM, so it was no surprise to fans when the two cuties linked up to release possibly the [cutest SM Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfbRLbMuGSs) of last year! Young and Free was one of Minseoks most recent solo ventures out of EXO, and showcased his beautiful voice as well as an [adorable choreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNTBIQpUNsU) that no one can resist bopping along to :)
                            
12. LAST BUT NOT LEAST! [Xiumins cut of the MAMA 2017 Album of the Year Daesang acceptance speech](https://streamable.com/ky4iq). As we know, our Minseokkie doesnt often speak at award shows or music shows, but after a very tense start to the 2017 awards season, and a very heartfelt speech by the other EXO members, Minseok was able to give this beautiful speech to EXO-Ls. Its a heartwarming moment and something I cherish very dearly. 

And just for fun, three viral gifs that broke Twitter just because this man existed. Powerful.

* [When Minseok invented aegyo and made more grown men fall in love with his mere presence](https://68.media.tumblr.com/49bdb283a654c9ffd91930471d7e7ea1/tumblr_ot4zu3jIDg1uwlz2bo2_540.gif)

* [When the choreo for The Eve first broadcasted and he spared no lives](https://78.media.tumblr.com/761cc944117b97bc19000d487c5011c4/tumblr_ote1akmAy11s3z68no1_400.gif)

And finally,

* [That time he merely existed and spoke words yet was the most beautiful thing on this planet](https://78.media.tumblr.com/ad76744d3516ff7dca8e9d0a78e180ac/tumblr_otfrfjNuFW1ucynxso1_400.gif)


Happy birthday, Minseok. You mean the world to us.

For live performances goes to this particular EXO-CBX performance ['Girl Problems'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWrAjVWZAiU&amp;ab_channel=FSGXOXO) 
;) and acoustic version of ['Call Me Baby'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imH-NCfpFiM&amp;ab_channel=SBSEntertainment). I also cannot fail to add ['Touch It'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGYabPApOIU&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=KBSKpop) (it has everything you could ever want in one video, also the dancers face - need I say more). 

Pretty much all of [Power Comeback Stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVfhHBo3-FY&amp;ab_channel=KBSWorldTV) are beautiful and should be watched repeatedly for all hours of the day~

And I know we at exocord have our famous Love Me Right vs Call Me Baby debate, but listen, ['Coming Over'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gM1vQ6MQw&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) is prime and should not be questioned 

 

To end this I want to say; watch Koreas #1 idol group at the [Olympics!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKCKn5RhbAw&amp;ab_channel=Olympic)

 

So tell me, what are some of your favourite EXO performances?

These events/threads are a great way for new fans to learn about older amazing things that happened. It's almost EXO's 6th anniversary, so we hope we can watch old videos and celebrate their successes together!

**ABOUT**   
Every month this thread will be posted 5 days before the first Friday of the month, when we will host a 'Throwback Night' to group watch videos together - a lot will be based around the content that gets posted throughout the week by subbies!

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**  
Easy! Start by sharing some of your favorite throwbacks below in a comment with a link~ If you are having trouble thinking of things, why not think about your favorite EXO cover or teaser from the past? Or if you are new to the fandom, ask a question, like ""hey, I really like Chanyeol, what are some great things he has done in the past?"" and then the community can send you great things like this.

The mods will then gather throwbacks together and create a playlist for us to watch together on Friday March 2nd.

**THE GROUP WATCH**  
When: Friday April 6th  
Time: Starting around 9PM EST --&gt; [Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180106T020000&amp;p1=250&amp;p2=224&amp;p3=70&amp;p4=749&amp;p5=136&amp;p6=333&amp;p7=145&amp;p8=235&amp;p9=47&amp;p10=240)

As we all know EXO's 6th year debut is coming up in just a short number of days (April 8th, 2012 to be ex'act), so the mods in r/EXO decided that the best way to show our love and appreciation for our boys is to share some of our favourite moments of each year from their official debut.

Each day will have a new discussion, today will be the year 2012, tomorrow will be 2013.. and so forth until 2018! [Woo](https://pa1.narvii.com/5938/00359bd089aec05672b372dd55bd1fa47e7130ec_hq.gif)~

 

So my beautiful EXO-Ls, what are some of your favourite moments from 2012? Here are some of mine!

I absolutely loved EXO debut [showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtt6WzsiS0g&amp;ab_channel=uglynezz) in Beijing. They looked so happy and excited it makes my heart grow absolutely fond!

When EXO-M received the ""[Most Popular Group Of The Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUSCNxON9ok&amp;ab_channel=EliNY)"" and EXO won ""[Best Outfit Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJXtReYFEo0&amp;ab_channel=LittleangelofJanuary)"" at the 5th Music Billboard Awards. Legends only~

Their presence at the [MNET Asian Music Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmack0mr4Mk&amp;ab_channel=MnetK-POP). Seeing all of them up on stage has always been so beautiful to see because no matter how big the stage is they manage to fit it like they were born to be up there!

2013 is *the* year for EXO. Their album XOXO broke the 12 year physical album drought and sold a million copies (this made EXO the fastest selling KPOP artist~)
EXO and EXO-K also won many awards that year from the same album!

2013 is also the year Koreas Official National Anthem released, Growl. [Thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) for this beautiful song. 

EXO-K had performed at the 2013 [PyeongChang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsvE7Km2Vw&amp;ab_channel=SMentEXOLive1) Winter Olympics Games Closing Ceremony (imagine years later they would perform again in South Korea in front of millions more~)

EXO-K performed many of their songs at the [Seoul Girls Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmo3p-MbgI&amp;ab_channel=outbackexo) and EXO-M performed at the [13th Top Chinese Music Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKKKqu0aE_Q&amp;ab_channel=%E2%98%86boonyi%E2%98%86%5B2%5D)

The Mnet Asian Music Awards let us see the amazing stages of [Growl and Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycql_T6Fc9c&amp;ab_channel=MnetK-POP). EXO has never failed to entertain their viewers - look how incredible their stage was! Kai vs Luhan was so amazing to see~

And of course, the amazing [Chogiwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2MZI6t2sC8&amp;ab_channel=Paola) was born. Along side Wolf [food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8MHFTlglcs&amp;ab_channel=HanaMasnah) and [noona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjF5GHtU4Vw&amp;ab_channel=HanaMasnah) version. 

My personal favourite, EXO on [Happy Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIB7bMBFfaA&amp;ab_channel=WISHeeStar) - which still remains my favourite show to watch to this day!



To end this lets look back -

2014 was the year they won four daesangs -

Their album Overdose came to life, along with one of my favourite videos from [EXO-K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BroPlHaDPK0&amp;ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29).

EXO started doing more endorsements like [Nature Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOWWRLwTH9M&amp;ab_channel=103oclock) and people just couldn't get enough, aren't they [adorable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlPOq0QPLYw&amp;ab_channel=1127subs)? [Waaaaah~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG7E1Bk8VZ0&amp;ab_channel=beautytap)


Endorsement!EXO rise~
Here are just a couple of my favourites: [Sunny10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOj3oZ_aI0&amp;ab_channel=EXOTICSubs), [KOLON SPORT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh1Ic4hxQvU&amp;ab_channel=%EC%BD%94%EC%98%A4%EB%A1%B1%EC%8A%A4%ED%8F%AC%EC%B8%A0KOLONSPORT) and [EXO K Pepero CF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG4WVE0qfss&amp;ab_channel=ryyy_ghrrbf)!

EXO being [cute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6JZFq1g9OY&amp;t=14s&amp;ab_channel=HuiZhenLim) constantly brings a smile to my face - also how silly and playful they all are. Can't forget EXO-K at the [RCY Red Cross Youth Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iME5VMvTg4U&amp;ab_channel=1127subs)!

Of course, they continue to dominate any stage, whether it is at the [MAMA's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfOBe38biyA&amp;ab_channel=MnetK-POP) or a simple [comeback stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdJp4MSXG5w&amp;ab_channel=MBCkpop).

Their album EXODUS exceeded one million sales, Call Me Baby broke records staying on Melon for 45 weeks and [Love Me Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqaVryDRd0&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) for 42 weeks straight. [Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfsla_Uh80) reached #1 on the real-time music charts (the [Chinese version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-qm0xh0VK4&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) following close behind in second). The track had also achieved an all-kill on melon within the first couple of hours it had released in Korea. 

EXOs single [Love Me Right ~romantic universe~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ueo4r-ZnX8&amp;ab_channel=avex) was the highest selling debut for a Korean artist in Japan.

Forbes Korea also named EXO their most influential celebrities. 

* Lays book set online records for his autobiography Independent 24 - 68,537 copies of it were sold within 24 minutes.
* Baekhyun OST [Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMWXVc3WAYs&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) (from the drama EXO Next Door) was the first web drama OST to top charts from music stores like Melon, Genie, Olleh Music, Naver Music, and Soribada. 
* Xiumins web drama [Falling For Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRw8CfSfF68&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) is the most drama with over 24 million views ~~trending fairy indeed~~

Chanyeol and Baekhyun starred in an episode of [Return of Superman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CAS7WW9dOL4) and snatched our whole entire hearts, and D.O. starred in a [Pure Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJtSquWl8tU&amp;ab_channel=DramaFever), a movie that will absolutely floor you. 

EXOs year in 2015 was nothing short but exceptional, winning 4 daesangs at the [Seoul Music Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnCzSvFzAg8&amp;ab_channel=namja12four), [Golden Disk Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcjZi3XZAfQ&amp;ab_channel=%E6%96%BD%E9%9B%B2%E7%80%9A) + [speech only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM7mqN-3j08&amp;ab_channel=parkboomde2ne1) and [encore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTnTTSf1-m0&amp;ab_channel=zhangwenxiang), [Melons Album of the Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uQY0O-XuHc&amp;ab_channel=NetteGonzales) and [MAMAs album of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCRkUBrCrRg&amp;ab_channel=k-Luv).

This makes EXO the group to win three consecutive daesangs for album of the year~ so so so incredibly proud.

Baekhyun sang at the South Korean national anthem at the [International Olympic Committee Meeting Opening Ceremony](https://twitter.com/DO_A_hae/status/960462996911702016)

EXO sang at the closing ceremony at the [Winter Olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKCKn5RhbAw&amp;t=49s&amp;ab_channel=Olympic) in PyeongChang. In 2013 EXO-K performed also at the PyeongChang closing ceremony.

KOMSCO (Korean National Mint)  is creating commemorative medals for EXO. They create these medals in honour of Korean historical figures and landmarks - EXO is the first KPOP star to have these medals made. We are producing an official commemorative medal in honor of top Korean idol group EXO, who is standing at the center of the Hallyu wave, and we plan to release it sometime in mid-April.
They are the first group to receive this honour.

79,2018-4-11,2018,4,11,13,8beaut,Happy Birthday Sehun!!!!,fringeoflife,1523419678,"Happy Birthday to our dear maknae! Last year even [Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/exo-sehun-birthday-style-evolution) celebrated this fashion icon's birthday right after his legendary conquering of [Paris Fashion Week](https://imgur.com/a/oeTEZ), so who knows what will happen this year.

Sehun hit 13 million followers on Instagram recently and has blessed us this year with plenty of [aesthetic posts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BesFToIg_69/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=oohsehun), [spoilers](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZ0Tqfg_uj/?taken-by=oohsehun) disguised as [aesthetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcOku02ASbP/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=oohsehun) posts, and even some [Instagram lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji0DdYMD9HQ&amp;ab_channel=SEHUNBUBS).

He lived out his [fashion dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZFoXMHxEwA) in [Hong Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bVkEtaJW6s), and had some phenomenal moments for us during [Exordium DOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qZGb8Au07c) and [Elyxion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MBddwX0kQc).

Sehun also contributed to EXO's domination of magazine covers this past year, including the Jan 2018 Leon magazine (link) and July 2017 [Marie Claire](https://imgur.com/a/hhGqH). Tom, [Super Elle](http://78.media.tumblr.com/82236e465d328fbb8ffcc769b975bf12/tumblr_oupv9xhOiE1qhmxnlo1_400.gif), and 1st Look all featured Sehun this year as well.  [He also rocked orange hair like no one else ever has](https://imgur.com/a/Xg1M7).

Sehun, Suho and Chanyeol went to the [Skechers K-Pop Dance Competition](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yVwg8HcUzCK920-ZaQ_WoqZS9s72Kl6S) and Sehun looked super adorable there.

[AngelHun](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/331149899678744577/433469662966054922/unknown.png) did community service in SunDuk Home the day before EXO left for the Dubai fountain show and spent time with the children. [He also sponsored meals for them.](https://twitter.com/joeunhana/status/952841309726765056)

He spent much of the end of 2017 filming for his new show on Netflix, Busted.The first [script reading](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/331149899678744577/433469433613254657/unknown.png) for his new drama Dokgo happened in March. Its looking like this year will be even busier than last year for EXOs maknae!

It has been a while since we let people know about our Discord server which is a [Chatroom for EXO-L &amp; KPop Stans!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/193010ac9f0f9de507dd0d8ed72bf6b2/tumblr_p76xsvatsx1roqbgyo5_r1_400.gif) Learn about it below and come try it out~ 

###What is Discord? 

Well, [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a free text and voice chat platform that is available through your web browser and also by download on [Windows/Mac](https://discordapp.com/download) or your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&amp;hl=en) &amp; [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-gamers/id985746746?mt=8) devices. 

Discord was made for Gamers originally but KPOP servers have popped up like crazy and are taking over since the platform makes it very easy to share images, gifs, videos, links, and to just chill and talk to tons of people who love similar things (like exo, haha).

###Information on our Server

Our server has been set-up with several chat channels so you can stay up to date with all the members. Each member has their own channel to chat and post photos/videos in, there is a fandom channel for fan art, fan fiction and fan videos and even a music bot so you can jump in and listen music with other people. There are always people around to chat with, especially during live streams. And on that note, a lot of our server members are multi-fandom and we all enjoy and talk about many other groups as well which has created so many wonderful friendships! 

We hold weekly group watches for the shows that the exo members are on, we watch concerts together and spam photos of the boys all the time~ It really is so much fun! 

###But I have no idea how to use discord! 
Ahhh no problem, If you are new to the platform you can [click here](https://goo.gl/cBAkt2) for a quick crash course on how to use the platform. It may seem intimidating at first but it is actually very easy and takes no time to get used to it. Plus all the members are extremely nice and will be willing to help you out when you join. 

##[**Official Join Link**](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP)


We hope to see everyone join up and chat with us all! 

&lt;3 love the r/exo mods &amp; r/exo discord mods!

Youre turning 28 and man, it has been a busy year. [Shall we recap some of the awesome stuff Lu brought us in the last twelve months?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/a6/3d/39a63d8b9718fc310e254d6389b7204b.gif)

Luhan owned the small screen, having filmed [Running Man China Season 5](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/160841120360/keep-running-running-man-china-season-5) (now known as Keep Running!) all over China, even flying to [Prague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYLWYYmxyew) to cosplay like the [prince he is](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7e43b3f5cd10f89a6fb73175dce6ca7a/tumblr_oscysfB1yM1ralgblo2_1280.jpg). He became more boyfriend than we couldve thought possible in [Date Super Star](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/161952095135/date-super-star-s2-masterlist) where he was overall soft. Special highlights include: helping find homes for stray kittens and  [puppies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJInP5YLKls), [dressing up as a soccer ball because why not ](https://78.media.tumblr.com/e185d29c5ceff10dfa4dc3f1be8bab90/tumblr_oqve87Sknh1ralgblo5_1280.jpg), and [learning how to be a firefighter](https://imgur.com/a/lSDHq). He showed many sides of himself to fans! On a more muscular note, he starred in the TV drama [Sweet Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0h7tS5OJqQ) with his newly announced girlfriend [Guan Xiaotong](http://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/41641fb0ly1fkat28x2yqj21s02dckjl.jpg) that is coming out later this year, which involved him going through [boxing training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojTNNW2NpyI) and [working out like crazy..like really, a lot](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWe30kWg_3o/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=7_luhan_m). Thanks for all the imagery, Lu. 

As if all that sweet and sappy wasnt enough (disregarding the boxing), [Fighter of the Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwfnQRAsWdg) was released, where Luhan starred as the main character. The show churned out [52 episodes](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/160101121380/fighter-of-the-destiny-masterlist) having brought in over **27 billion views!!!!** Absolutely amazing! His most recent projects have been Keep Running Season 6, which has just started, and filming [Hot Blood Dance Crew](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/172965912650/hot-blood-dance-crew-masterlist) which is [airing currently](http://78.media.tumblr.com/07c0ee26ea2870d170f15195c9abc30c/tumblr_p62ovwoavv1ralgblo4_1280.gif) as well. Its been great to see him bring those tracksuits back out!

Over the last year, Luhan has blessed us with a lot of new music, but that doesnt mean China isnt still appreciating the old! His album Reloaded, which was released in 2015, is still on the Mainland China music charts. [It has been on the chart for 100 weeks, and been at number 1 a total of 41 times](https://twitter.com/luking0420/status/971530553848508416). This past year he continued his Xperience Series which started a new mark of him finding his sound musically and continues to be [his journey of self growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCl8QpTrOrE). 


MUSIC FACT TIME! 

* Throughout the year he released 14 songs, including remixes and 7 music videos. 
* Venture sold (digitally) over 2,565,478 copies, Imagination over 1,784,090 copies and I over 2,337,087 copies.
* In the CHN Billboards, What If I Said, Roleplay and Set It Off reached #1!
* XXVII won Album of the Year at the Asian Music Gala.
* [Winter Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYVIlFVnRQE), [What If I Said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1eaeSbOxH4), [On Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRZijQItrP4) won Top 10 Songs and [Skin to Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9JDCV63_I) won Best Music Video at the Fresh Asia Chart Festival
* Luhan also won the Asian Music Influence Award and Baidu Brand Digital Equity Most Valuable Male Artist

Phew, dont you get tired reading all those accomplishments? Thanks for working hard for us, Boss Lu~ Its clearly paid off. :)

While his studio may call him Boss, theres a certain restaurant that prefers the term Colonel, bringing us two **extra special** CFs: [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3-vZtcF7Y) and [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXx5UD1l5U). Sit down before you watch them, just trust me on this one. Luhan signed a deal with [Adidas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBv4aV1WY0I) and [Coca-Cola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QnnyfKTlhU), because why not have a refreshing glass right after you work out? He also did work with [Louis Vuitton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WboTWy6Gg), flexing his high-fashion chops and infuriatingly handsome face. We certainly didnt have any lack of Fashion Lu, and heres to continuing the trend in your 28th year and bringing in more of that ~~ohmy~~ gold!

While this is just a quick run-through of what hes been up to in the last year, be sure to catch up with his day-to-day activities through our ICYMI threads, posted weekly!  From [his 27th year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSPJjkP9GfA) [to now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQKtC2h7lqk), Luhan has worked very hard and I hope he enjoys his very special day, eats delicious food, and knows he is loved by so many fans worldwide. My parting gift to you are these beautiful photo albums of a time when Lu looked  [absolutely gorgeous](https://imgur.com/a/s3WLf), [comfy as hell](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1wpahg9b18mvOo0FHdzCxxO3oLg5eVtZL), and [so adorable you just want to squish him even though hes now 28 and thats not weird at all.](https://imgur.com/a/7jPRS) 

##Happy birthday, Luhan~

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #161! 
But MORE IMPORTANTLY,
## **[HAPPY BIRTHDAY](https://media.giphy.com/media/V2SHmN2Wrxphm/giphy.gif) [TAO!!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7b66dad374fb16325ad9b7b1962011c3/tumblr_inline_o2licxPXF61snj0ne_500.gif)**

This past year has been a big one for Tao, with everything from new music to a [wax figure](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/981005651257147392) that will be unveiled on his birthday. Will they get two cakes, one for each Tao?

He released the banging singles [Hater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se860tf5M_w) and [Beggar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XifpfhFR-Kk) this past year and performed both at [the YSL Beauty Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04TWoaEFqn4). Beggar (Remix) was the theme song for [Electric Daisy Carnival China 2018](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/986123128727257088). If thats not the statement of the century, [I dont know what is.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/6947a20c89cbadac7d6bf5fb79307f88/tumblr_inline_nkgxd2RQLW1t4nslm.gif) Hater was #1 on the [Fresh Asia music chart for 4 consecutive weeks](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/973047248706723841), the longest a song is allowed on the charts. [Legends only~](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2f4e0fb78a567a4c0d352d0a0ae0bdf6/tumblr_inline_oivf6l6f501s62ouj_500.gif) The [first show](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcCiVMnU8AI4jdd.jpg) for Taos [IS GOD](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/983919174241083393) Concert Tour [just wrapped up in Shanghai](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/985693729615790080) where he had the chance to perform [Beggar](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/990947009124159489) and many other songs. The [visuals](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcEPp9iWsAA8Hse.jpg) are enough to [heat up your laptops](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcCwcfcWsAAKMbA.jpg), and were looking forward to [more fancams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPQvAcB2I94) coming out! [Thank you](http://cdn58.picsart.com/168258797001202.gif) for working so hard on your music, we appreciate every song! 

In the world of television, Tao is the [Nations Producer/Main MC](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/975216351043248129) for the official Chinese spin-off of Produce 101. Its been garnering a lot of attention, so please try to tune in! The first episode aired April 21st and will continue for the next few months. Cant wait to see what awesome [performance advice](http://37.media.tumblr.com/244c2dbecb522c5cb89acb1197db0af3/tumblr_n4aewzkHwD1qi4jgto1_250.gif) Tao is able to gift the trainees. Street Dance of China just wrapped up a succesful season where Tao was a [team leader](https://twitter.com/SDC_Update/status/990140241078927360) for one of the 4 troupes of contestants. Whether dancing, singing, or all-around entertaining, Tao is intent on [showing all of his sides to us!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/3a72540450636cf6a0a96f95b4c0fba9/tumblr_inline_n4lsrty2QP1ql6qbh.gif) 


Outside of the music realm, Tao worked with the Kering Foundation to create a PSA about their [#ICouldHaveBeen](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbx9QNFHH5V/) project working towards eliminating violence against women worldwide. This is an incredibly important statement to make and I hope he knows how [proud his fans are.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/871d12d80a6ed8e5bf691c6f36862795/tumblr_ou6hx3FZ1W1r9f1l9o4_540.gif) He also was recently announced as the [YSL Beauty Music Ambassador](https://twitter.com/TrendingWeibo/status/984594344807141377). Taos drama [Negotiator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrx_4v63BJk) reached [1 billion views on Chinese platforms](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/961845528332914688). No biggie, not like [thats a ridiculously huge number or anything](https://78.media.tumblr.com/427531c62bbead56a81b0e097fc95903/tumblr_inline_nqit17Vsyh1s230lw_500.gif) Congratulations to the entire cast and crew!
Whether Tao was singing for us, dancing his heart out, mentoring young professionals, or making a [fool of himself on Instagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZgfGhziDBg), he made his last year *HIS* and EXO-L cannot wait to see what else he has up his sleeves for us!

What have your favorite moments with Tao been this year? Leave your birthday wishes for [our panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsJLLEwUYZM) below!

This year Baeks been busy with CBX in both Japan and Korea, Instagram, and you know, just [singing the national anthem for the IOC at the Olympics](https://twitter.com/do_a_hae/status/960462996911702016). No big deal or anything

Lets start with his instagram post from [last years birthday](https://twitter.com/my0nen0n1y/status/992590206145462272), a great example of his love of close up [deadly af](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaX6US1A8Cz/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo) selfies. We were also blessed with only the [CUTEST BABY BAEK PICTURE EVER](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYBOdxqAmYw/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo) and some A+ photoshopping [skills](https://www.instagram.com/p/BU_meVtAlgR/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo). Were so lucky that he trusts us enough to have a public instagram and I hope these blessings continue for a long time.

This past year was also THE year for CBX. It started with a Japan debut mini and [the greatest anthem to money ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNwYapPXNkw) and continued with 
[CBX stages for ElyXiOn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrduS5D_maw) shows and these last few months of a [first Korean comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib674A1yMtg) and [first full album in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sIaUu2igUY).

By the time youre reading this, we may know more about [Priv,](https://www.instagram.com/privenewyork/) the mysterious teasers that have been going on for a month for what looks like a clothing line designed by BBH. The instagram account keeps talking about a press release on May 6, so well have to wait just a tad bit longer to see more.
 
One of the big things on the horizon for Baek is participation in the [One K unification song](https://twitter.com/dyo_00/status/990758842148511744) to be released in August. 20 idols are contributing to the song which is meant to be a symbol of the unification of the peninsula. This is so, so exciting beyond the world of Kpop and just goes to show the power of music in tense situations and even in political unrest. What a proud moment to be an Erie.

Heres some of my favorite looks/performances from Baek this year - this [killer airport look](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jSRJDoaAlh8IGNRcn6KDf5WBfp_7xBed), this [Cloud 9 performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FMBCi7d1Eg&amp;t=1s) and last but not least, everyones favorite totally-not-stress-inducing performance, [The Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71mb092scrM&amp;ab_channel=CENTENARY). 

What about you? What were your favorite Baek moments from this year? Leave your birthday wishes below!

Last week was jam packed with two birthdays for Tao and Baekhyun and I can still feel myself coming down of the buzz of Taos new concerts and all the new fansite releases for Baekhyun!

Unfortunately as we enter into a new week, it is with a heavy heart that I share the news of Kai's father passing away from a chronic illness. Kai speaks the sun, stars and planets of his father who encouraged him to do dance and continue on with his dreams. Kai and his family have requested for the funeral and events to be remain private so the mods have decided that we will not be allowing any photos, videos or content in relation to these events out of respect for those who are mourning.

EXO-L, let's be strong this week for Kai, the other members and for CBX as their new Japanese album and concert drops this week. 

Let's love!",8,6

After two very successful birthday projects, one for [Xiumin (raised $405)](https://imgur.com/a/zKHG7) and one for [Sehun/Luhan (raised $440)](https://imgur.com/a/XOsel) we are back with our month of May birthday project for Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suho! 

**How it works:** For each EXO member we will be offering 3 different charities to choose from, and you will vote on which one you would like/have most interest in donating to. We want to offer different charities from across the world that showcase each members personalities (or powers!) as best as possible.

**How we collect:** We are using PayPal Pools in order to collect for these donations. A link will be posted for each PayPal pool for the different Birthday Projects. You can donate any amount (even $1 helps) at any time until the deadline date. Your name will not show on the feed, so don't worry about doxxing. If you are cautious about donating to us, we will post all receipts showing which charity we have donated to. We have chosen to use Paypal Pool to donate to since it is against PayPal's policy to profit from this system and they can shut down the account on there if it is used incorrectly. In the case that the money is used incorrectly, the pool will automatically be shut down and the money will be returned immediately. Please note, Unfortunately PayPal pools is not a tool that is available in ALL countries around the world, so if you would like to contribute and you are from one of these locations please send me a private message. 

*Note: Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suhos Birthday all fall under the same month therefore the donations will be collected as 1 project on behalf of ALL 3 members. The donation will be made on the last members birthday - This month being Suhos on May 22 @ 12am KST.*

###Charity of choice:

[**Free Korean Dogs**](https://www.freekoreandogs.org/)

* Korea / Canada / USA
* About FKD: Our goal is to end the Korean dog meat trade. Our international rescue and adoption program saves hundreds of dogs each year from the Korean dog meat trade. We also promote public awareness to create a cultural shift from cruelty to compassion for dogs in Korea. We are an international community of volunteers and animal welfare activists.
*  Our donation will go towards helping feed, vaccinate and bring over dogs who have been rescued from the meat trade in Korea. 

*Free Korean Dogs received the most votes, so we will be making the donation to them and hopefully be raising enough money to fully save, support and adopt a dog in Tao, Baekhyun &amp; Suho's name.* 

**Deadline:** May 22 @ 12 AM KST 

**Donate Here:** &lt;https://paypal.me/pools/c/83TmwGLNrt&gt;",0,9

Lets give Suho all the love today and appreciate all hes done in the past year!

Suho is  of the best ship of the past 5 years - Suho x [Suhorang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soohorang_and_Bandabi) - and it goes all the way back to last June when he updated the EXO-L official website with this [glorious phone wallpaper](http://fy-exo.com/post/161412552127) and adorable message. The [Pyeongchang Olympics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbOceHCF_I2/?taken-by=pyeongchang2018) account and the [EXO account](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbO8xamFwGC/?taken-by=weareone.exo) on instagram have both been used to show how much Suho loves Suhorang and the [Olympics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfdGlg5FH6P/?taken-by=weareone.exo)

Suhos updates on the EXO-L website extend way [beyond just caring for our phones.](https://twitter.com/bunnymye0n/status/960462971590737921) 1 Day 1 Suho has kept EXO-Ls fed for a while with cute caring messages and beautiful selcas. Probably the biggest single contributor to his selca collection was [The Last Kiss](https://twitter.com/EXOXOXOID/status/969417484024475649), the [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl8VAc6e9ng) he starred in from December to March. He shined on the stage as [Prince Rudolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRKtaWudMA&amp;feature=youtu.be) for those 4 months and did so well that hes been cast in [another musical later this year](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/976668367120560128?s=21). Suho was thrilled with EXO-Ls support of his musical endeavors and reciprocated that love with [special gifts](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/969126586325729280) on his last performance.

Suhos acting and singing arent just in musicals. The drama [Rich Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtByCUDKKw) is airing currently on Wednesdays and Thursdays with Suho starring as [Lee Yoochan](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/989845177354174465), a genius programmer with no facial recognition. He had not one, but two song collabs with Jang Jae-in, [Dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHj0S8-hwQU) and [Do You Have a Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjHAA2rmK7I). 

As leader, Suho is at the forefront for any big EXO events and this year had so many opportunities for him to represent the group. When EXO became the first K-Pop group to receive commemorative medals, [Suho was there at the recognition ceremony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBk1qM8gbE&amp;ab_channel=%EB%A7%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%BC%EB%A6%ACMYDAILY) When EXO travelled to [Dubai](https://twitter.com/exo_schedules/status/953957995532161024) to watch Power as the first K-Pop song to be used in the Dubai Fountain Show, Suho reminded us how this win was for K-Pop, not just for EXO. EXO has won so many awards in 6 years, yet [Suhos acceptance speeches](https://youtu.be/b7RZcr_WO3Y?t=51) are still consistently humble, thankful, and appreciative towards other artists, EXO-Ls, and those who have inspired them. 


What were your favorite Suho moments this year? Were you a fan of his [airport looks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoU6absPm2ey-PQLWf7DcF0HCMDu4jVB), or maybe more fond of [Suitho](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UN_BFWpTefleN77QtwjMvViAaHp-AHtt) with [glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBwnfhPK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be)? Did you enjoy the [hip rolls of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDFFfuYO380) and love how [Suho looks at EXO-Ls?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlpQoJjA1vk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Probably the biggest single contributor to his selca collection was [The Last Kiss](https://twitter.com/EXOXOXOID/status/969417484024475649), the [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl8VAc6e9ng) he starred in from December to March. He shined on the stage as [Prince Rudolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRKtaWudMA&amp;feature=youtu.be) for those 4 months and did so well that hes been cast in [another musical later this year](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/976668367120560128?s=21). Suho was thrilled with EXO-Ls support of his musical endeavors and reciprocated that love with [special gifts](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/969126586325729280) on his last performance.

Suhos acting and singing arent just in musicals. The drama [Rich Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtByCUDKKw) is airing currently on Wednesdays and Thursdays with Suho starring as [Lee Yoochan](https://twitter.com/kimjunmyeonnews/status/989845177354174465), a genius programmer with no facial recognition. He had not one, but two song collabs with Jang Jae-in, [Dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHj0S8-hwQU) and [Do You Have a Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjHAA2rmK7I). 

As leader, Suho is at the forefront for any big EXO events and this year had so many opportunities for him to represent the group. When EXO became the first K-Pop group to receive commemorative medals, [Suho was there at the recognition ceremony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBk1qM8gbE&amp;ab_channel=%EB%A7%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%BC%EB%A6%ACMYDAILY) When EXO travelled to [Dubai](https://twitter.com/exo_schedules/status/953957995532161024) to watch Power as the first K-Pop song to be used in the Dubai Fountain Show, Suho reminded us how this win was for K-Pop, not just for EXO. EXO has won so many awards in 6 years, yet [Suhos acceptance speeches](https://youtu.be/b7RZcr_WO3Y?t=51) are still consistently humble, thankful, and appreciative towards other artists, EXO-Ls, and those who have inspired them. 


What were your favorite Suho moments this year? Were you a fan of his [airport looks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoU6absPm2ey-PQLWf7DcF0HCMDu4jVB), or maybe more fond of [Suitho](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UN_BFWpTefleN77QtwjMvViAaHp-AHtt) with [glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBwnfhPK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be)? Did you enjoy the [hip rolls of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDFFfuYO380) and love how [Suho looks at EXO-Ls?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlpQoJjA1vk&amp;feature=youtu.be) 

Hope everyone has an amazing week!

Before we begin, I want to thank everyone once again for aiding us for Tao, Baekhyun and Suho's birthday donations. It means a lot to /u/99101004 and I to see EXO-Ls join together for a meaningful birthday present~



I want to first congratulate Sehun on becoming [VOGUE's best-dressed man](https://www.vogue.com/article/louis-vuitton-resort-2019-exo-sehun-best-dressed-menswear) at the 2019 Louis Vuittons show for the second year in a row!

Our sweet Lu deer, although he was under the weather, still attended a [charity event](https://twitter.com/mybabydeer/status/1000589610047553536). We hope our sweet deer feels better after getting plenty of rest!

Baekhyun's [Lined Magazine](https://linedstore.com/) cover (the same one Kai was on a couple months earlier) is releasing in June and we are so happy to see him thrive with Priv.

We're all super amazed with Kris' release of ['Like That'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1HAMUAXzbs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=KrisWu) and topping charts worldwide, as expected of course. 

Also Tao's hard work on his concertIS GODand to the release of his song ['Misunderstand'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kacRVXiyK8&amp;ab_channel=PreciousZTaoBar2)~

 

What exciting things have you all done over the weekend and what plans do you have for this coming week?

The mods put together a small quick hit about what is going on and what we generally know about the new military requirements in South Korea. We will continue to update this as more information is released, feel free to discuss in the comments below or update us on other information you may have found\~

# NEW ENLISTMENT RULES IN KOREA

Males in Korea ages 18\-35 are required to enlist for about 2 years in the military. The social stigma is that males should enlist by age 30.

**28\+ International Age (Includes Xiumin):** Cannot delay enlistment for any reason  
**25\-27 International Age (Includes the majority of EXO):** Can delay through overseas travel (6 months at a time, up to 5 times in one year, the total time length of these permits cannot exceed 2 years)  
**KEEP IN MIND:** This doesnt change WHEN people have to enlist directly. But it does make it harder for people to postpone enlistment.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EXO:** Before these new regulations took place, idols were able to travel freely without restrictions. With these new regulations idols will not be able to travel overseas/have as many schedules outside of Korea as they once did. As listed above, they can only leave Korea 5 times in a year, making it hard for idols to do promotions and concerts internationally.

**WHAT ABOUT XIUMIN?** Xiumin was able to delay being enlisted into the army by going to school and working toward obtaining a PhD. Through these new rules, any male Korean citizen will not be able to delay this process by going to university and obtaining a PhD. As of right now, we are unsure of how soon he will need to enlist and will not tolerate any spreading of rumours about what is happening until SM gives us confirmation.

**WHAT ABOUT LAY?** Lay will not be affected by any of this since he is EXOs only Chinese member and is not required to complete military service.

**FOR NOW....** These new regulations have already been put into effect on the 29th of May of this year (2018). As always we will not tolerate any hate towards former or current members. We will not allow any false or malicious rumours to spread, so please refrain from posting fake rumours until SM officially releases a statement regarding their idols and enlistment dates.",24,49

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #167! 

Stop what youre doing and stream Kris new MV for [Tian Di](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1Zk8MJUPE&amp;feature=youtu.be)- personally this might be one of my favorite releases from him ever! And he is looking mighty fine in that video~ To help you cool off from those visuals, heres a video of Chanyeol [drenching himself in ice water](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj3gCyeHBs0/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=real__pcy) to show support for Koreas first hospital dedicated to treating Lou Gehrigs Disease. The Ice Bucket Challenge has been making a comeback amongst idols because of this hospital, and I hope they receive a lot of support in the wonderful work that theyre doing.

I AM SINCERELY SORRY FOR NOT MENTIONING THIS LAST WEEK BUT BAEKHYUN [NOW HAS A TWITTER](https://twitter.com/B_hundred_Hyun/status/1005254328829919232) jESUS my apologies for the late reminder, I just figured that every EXO-L had imploded by now from the very concept. 

As always, catch up with the recent happenings with the latest [ICYMI thread](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002946343118110721)!

I mean like, not just title tracks, but from concerts or other performances too, even CBX or Solo songs. I feel like if you immediately asked me what my favourite choreo was I would question what you meant, like do you want me to pick one that I am most impressed with... One I would show my friends who don't listen to exo? or like, the one I just all around enjoy the most? They are both very different. 

I think if I had to narrow it down: 

* **One I am the most impressed with:** [Electric Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcdLVKYsHHU) &amp; [Blooming Days](https://youtu.be/UdjEoGzXxmI) (CBX \- mainly because they also sing it live every time as well)
* **One I enjoy watching the most:** [The One](https://youtu.be/mSMz_uRYRwo) (CBX) &amp; [White Noise](https://youtu.be/aQV7hfHxIco) ..... ok and maybe also [One &amp; Only](https://youtu.be/pfHuoL_aQI8)

So tell me, what are your favourite? Is it a personal fave in terms of you enjoy watching it the most, or is it one your most impressed with? Link some videos if you can for new fans who may have never seen yet\~",20,31

EXO has been extremely hard at work for us, we should all cool off by watching their [Nature Republic CF](https://youtu.be/tl1rCpiQvvk). We could not have seen this coming.... maybe ever..........
If that doesn't help cool you off maybe you can look at Baekhyun relaxing on the [beautiful island of Jeju](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkMFfCLgc22/?taken-by=baekhyunee_exo)!


Our CBX boys and our dear Yoona were also chosen as the 'Honorary Ambassador's of Safety' by the City Government of Seoul and we could not be any more prouder than we are of our boys. 



To spice up this weeks Casual Convo, let's throw in a discussion question?

**If EXO could collab with any group or artist, who would you like it to be?**


If you don't know me, you should know I absolutely love and adore SHINee. It certainly helps when both of my groups love each other dearly as well~

Both groups are very much fans of the other - they have [danced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogu-8XjPOO0&amp;ab_channel=SBSEntertainment) to each others songs before, and let us certainly not forget [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQewn5Rgwx8&amp;ab_channel=TsaiMinya) absolute beauty. Taemin and Kai have sang together with Taemin's song ['Pretty Boy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fKhWic1yg&amp;ab_channel=MnetOfficial) and we are all still waiting for more.

I'd also *love* to see a collab between Key, Boa and Xiumin. Please SM make it so!

192,2018-6-28,2018,6,28,5,8ucyh3,What's a song you didn't like at first but then grew to love?,Xaille,1530130514,"There's always that one song that pops into my mind that still blows me away today, and that's: 

**El Dorado**

When I came back into Kpop, it was during Monster/Lucky One era, so after listening to the Ex'Act album, I went on and looked through more of EXO's discography. I remember the first time I heard El Dorado. I was driving to work around 8 in the morning and I was almost there, I had EXO's discography on shuffle, when all of a sudden I started paying attention to the lyrics some more... *""They're singing about El Dorado? Why are they singing about El Dorado...Sail... sail... sail?? This is weird.""* (My first instinct pictures 'The Road to El Dorado' movie, so my confusion got even more far out there...) I thought it was weird and skipped it (*BIG MISTAKE*). 

Then heard it again another time while I had EXO Youtube videos on shuffle at work (I'm a great employee) and heard Baekhyun's vocals. I was floored. I couldn't believe what I was listening to. My ears were in heaven, who's voice was that? I quickly switched to the Youtube tab and saw Baekhyun belting out that note and I was instantly in love (this may or may not have solidified my biasing Baekhyun...) In that moment I was like *""wtf why did I ever skip this?""* and replayed the video. 

Sometimes it takes more than one listen for me to truly realize how great (or bad) of a song it may truly be. If I think a song is ""bad"" now, I'll give it one or two more listens to really decide if that's how I feel or not. 

What's a song you've come to love? I'm really interested in how you've found out that you actually really love whatever song it may be! When was your *""wtf I'm crazy for skipping this!""* moment?

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #170!

Its been yet another busy summer week for EXO! As the temperature rises, so do our spirits~ Kris threw down another [ridiculously nice photoshoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8vg194/kris_wu_gq_china_july_2018_issue/) for GQ while Luhan was...well, he was letting you know that the deer [be everywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8vkl3y/luhan_x_troyboi_lu_remix/) with a fresssssh new remix of Lu! Lay has been making us all [cry on Instagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8uzmwk/180630_lay_instagram_update_i_am_truly_grateful/) and is now back in SK for unknown reasons! EXO-L gave him a very warm welcome and trended a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/morningpassages/status/1013716969495908352) to let him know how much wed missed him being in the same vicinity as the rest of the boys.

Speaking of, we just wrapped up the annual EXO-L Japan fanmeets, a classic time full of games, silliness, and our beloved boys doing extremely stupid things. Catch up [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8v3b79/180629180701_icymi_exol_japan_fan_club_adventure/) All other news updates can be checked out at the latest [ICYMI](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8utusn/18062329_icymi_exo_weekly_news_updates/) :) 

I wanted to give a special note to CBX, alongside SNSD Yoona, to be appointed [Honorary Safety Ambassadors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kec8VwiiUoA) by the South Korean government! Its a tremendous honor for our boys to be recognized this way and we are all very proud~

As a final note, mark your calendars for Friday at 10PM EST for our catch-up of CBX's Reality Show! For those of you who haven't been able to watch CBX's reality show yet or are only a few episodes in, we will watch all subbed episodes starting with Episode 1! Join us for some [fun with CBX](https://pa1.narvii.com/6393/58124a51b0d7556c7b0094dd508c48e4d39d7856_hq.gif! 

Dont forget, our [2018 Census](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8tnvqg/rexos_2018_census/) closes this Sunday at 10pm EST! Please help us make our community better with feedback, as well as thinking very very deeply about your EXO preferences~

13,2018-7-3,2018,7,3,22,8vs2n9,Do you have a favourite photo of your bias?,mochismyeon,1530623454,"We all have one, you cannot deny. There is ONE photo you see every once in awhile that makes your heart thump and you smile for absolutely no reason (but if I'm being real, thats every picture I see of them smiling). 

If you are not into the social media/fandom side of EXO outside of the reddit community, you probably do not see the absolutely INCREDIBLE photos fansites take of our favourite boys. I can guarantee that a fansite is the one who captured this favourite moment and bringing my point back around, if you aren't on Twitter or our discord server you might miss a lot of these photos. 
These fansites are also the reason why we have video's from concerts, fanmeets, etc!

One of my favourite fancams is from the CBX Fansign from a Xiumin fansite (who does by the name of [SCHNEE](https://twitter.com/SCHNEE326)), the video she uploaded is so absolutely cute and super adorable, [Xiumin is truly a curious kitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91w_tfPoOOU&amp;ab_channel=SCHNEE%EC%8A%88%EB%84%A4)



Here are only /some/ of my favourite photos from the boys, I will leave that to all of you~ but I will include a list of my favourite fansites for each member!

And to our OT9 fansites on twitter: [Blue Spring](https://twitter.com/BlueSpring_xo) and [Serendipity](https://twitter.com/EXO_Serendipity)



For our boys in China a lot of them have their fansites over on Weibo, which is harder to access than twitter so I recommend joining our [exo discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) to be able to see so many pictures and more! 

While these are only a couple of my favourite fansites and their photos, tell me in the comments who you most look forward to seeing preview pictures of after an event! 

So please~ share your favourite picture of the boys, what are some of your favourite fancams, tell me who you shed a tear for when you find previews that look exactly like hq pictures (candy crush I'm looking at you)!",24,16

I finally got it to pair (I pressed the yes button really quickly so it could finish configuring) and Im wondering, will it give me problems on the day of the concert if the Bluetooth has a hard time connecting? Has anyone else dealt with this problem? It was connecting just fine a month  ago, maybe its my phone? ",7,6

45,2018-7-7,2018,7,7,5,8wnerl,Do you think that EXO's winter releases would do better if they weren't marketed as Christmas/Winter releases?,VallasC,1530908803,"I got to thinking about this because there are other groups who do really well with two mini albums or one full, one repack, and one mini. Generally EXO's Winter Releases do pretty awful when it comes to Music Video views and overall attention from the public and the fandom. Lightsaber is literally a STAR WARS collaboration and still pretty much no love.

I think this is because these tracks and these stages are all presented as filler inbetween main comebacks. When I think ""When was the last EXO comeback"" I pretty much never think of Japanese releases, and only sometimes view the Winter albums as *real* comebacks.

The really interesting part of this is that we know a lot of the tracks on these albums are throwaways. The producers never see EXO and go on dozens of writing camps. They're sending tracks to the management which are deciding where they should go and when. Songs like Twenty Four and Been Through were clearly not written to be Christmasy at all, and a lot of these songs are only really winter themed due to lyrics.

If Lightsaber was seen and promoted as an official comeback, there's no reason it wouldn't have millions of more views. It also sucks that these Music Videos are generally shot well but are very slow and story based. 

It's just very odd to think about, because there wouldn't really need to be much more work on SM's end, just a change in style and attitude. Sing For You and Lightsaber both got music videos, if Lightsaber was full length (which we know it was shot to be full length and then edited down) and there was choreographing mixed in throughout the song in typical kpop fashion there would definitely be much more demand for those tracks.

Also, I totally get what they're doing by having these Christmas albums, and that people enjoy the winter and holiday aspect of these albums, but I'm just curious what you all think from a pure sales and demand perspective.",10,6

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #171!

I blinked and now it's July...anyone else [streaming?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4T43PncyQc) EXO have gotten off to a fun start this month with [ElyXiOn in Kuala Lumpur](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8ww5dy/180707_icymi_the_e%E2%84%93yxion_at_kuala_lumpur_master/)! Check our wonderful [ICYMI](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1015644645227761664) moment for more photos and updates of our smiling boys\~ I know they had a ton of fun with all of the [Malaysian EXO-L](https://78.media.tumblr.com/a6ee7c53fba0358720472bd92fa5c057/tumblr_inline_nr081qAWfA1smae63_400.gif)! Anyone else counting down to the Dot concert? [I'm curious](https://78.media.tumblr.com/84ca3bb5709a1d28f79344db856d367f/tumblr_inline_nswkigmIvM1sfg2yf_500.gif) about what special stages we might get to see there...

If you're craving even more, check out Episode [1 and 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8x2kkn/180708_kai_star_road_cooking_show_episode_1_ep2/) of Kai's new show, Star Road!

It seems like these boys just can't let go of the big or small screens. Why not project them onto yours while watching the newly subbed [ElyXiOn in Japan documentary!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8x2q9x/180704_exo_e%E2%84%93yxion_in_japan_documentary/) Thank you for our hard-working angelic EXO-L who help sub content so we can all enjoy! 

Speaking of angels, Chen has recently made [another generous donation](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8wm8b8/chen_donated_20000000krw_to_gyeonggido_shieung/) to charity. Thank you for always being an upstanding role model, [our Chennie](https://data.whicdn.com/images/186747567/original.gif)\~

Thank you so much if you were able to take the time to participate in our annual census! If you weren't able to, no worries at all\~ We decided to not design the census results this year in order to make changes more quickly and show you the results faster. Below you will find some new changes that we are making to subreddit based on census feedback and a summary of the results from the census. If you have any questions/comments etc about the changes, please feel free to dm the mods or send us a comment below!

# [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) Rule Updates + General Changes

Based on feedback we received from the census and speaking to some of the subscribers from the sub, we have decided to make the following changes to the subreddit:

* **Fan Made Posts** that include, covers, mash ups, fan art, video edits and reaction videos do not have to be put in a weekly thread anymore. You can post them individually using the new flair **FAN MADE.** If you are posting fanmade work made by someone else, please make sure you are linking to the ORIGINAL post and to credit them in the title of the post.. For example [""D.O. Monster Fan Art by ItalianSoda""](https://twitter.com/theitaliansoda/status/1011700591167492098)  If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comments below!

1. **Reaction Videos:** Reaction videos are now allowed on the sub, but the mods have done some research and decided that if you are posting a reaction video, you may only post OTHERs reaction videos and not your own. Posting your own reaction videos will be marked as Solicitation/Self Promotion of Goods+Services.
2. **Fan Fiction:** You are now allowed to post Fan Fiction on the subreddit. Please do NOT post any strict smut or porn without plot. This will be removed immediately. If you are going to post fan fiction, you need to post these a [text post and fill out the following format ](http://prntscr.com/k437vd)when posting in description:

&gt;**Title:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Rating:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pairing:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Genre/AU:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Trigger Warnings:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Length:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Description:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Link:**

* **Social Media Updates:** Social Media posts + EXO-L Fansite updates will be under the flair **OFFICIAL SNS.** Please make sure to only post once a day for updates for each member - For Example: When Kai posts 4 separate instagram updates, they should all go in one post called ""180708 Kai Instagram Updates"". If he posts more after you have already posted, you have the option to either remove the post and repost or post the other updates in the comments\~ This new rule is to help declutter the sub of so many social media updates that flood the feed.
* **Group Watches:** We are bringing back our Weekly Group watches every Friday at 10PM EST. The theme/schedule of the group watch will be posted earlier that day with a link to where the watch will be taking place.
* **ICYMI Threads:** We will be doing more of these! We will still be posting weekly news ones, as well as threads for events, airport dates &amp; more. Please feel free to make these yourselves and also reply in the comments with favourite moments etc or more HQ photos that come out afterwards!
* **Fan cam Flair:** We have added the fan cam flair and encourage people to share new fancams that come out from your favourite fansites! Please title these with the following format: **YYMMDD Member - Song Name @ Event** for example: [180707 D.O. - Growl @ Elyxion in Malaysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v48FXh_7-vo&amp;t=0s)
* **Photo Collections:** Our Discord Server, EXOcord, works very hard to collect all the photos of the members for different events. We are now going to allow them to post these collections on the sub for you all to enjoy and download as well. Please title these with the following format: **YYMMDD Member - Event Name \[#ofPhotos\]** for example: [170503 Xiumin - Girls Awards \[88P, 40GIFS\]](http://goo.gl/yMj5d7) All photo collections need to be more than 5 Photos in total and should be uploaded to either IMGUR or Google Drive/Photos.
* [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **EXO-L Introduction Thread:** Can you believe we hit 6k subbies already!? We are so happy to hear this. In order to hopefully help subbies feel a little less nervous about posting and commenting, we are creating a bi-monthly thread posted on the 15th that will be pinned to the top of the subreddit! This thread will be designed for people who are new (or lurkers!) to introduce themselves and tell us about who their bias' are etc.
* **Personal User Flairs:** Unfortunately, to help with the migration over to the new reddit layouts, we had to lose our pretty logo user flairs. If you use the new reddit, you will see now that there is [pretty coloured flairs with member names.](http://prntscr.com/k4358c) You can change these member names as you please and use the colours for cute sayings etc, or switch the colours around!

**Note From The Mods:** The thing that struck us the most is that we totally agree with you all when you pointed out about how you all miss the interaction that was on the sub before. The mods feel like as a result of strict rules that were put in place a long time ago and the creation of our [discord chat server,](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) we have noticed dwindling interaction, comments and posting on the sub in general. We really have been trying hard to up that by creating new threads, discussions and more for you all to participate in and we really hope that the new more laid back rules will encourage people to participate more in the subreddit and bring back a lot more discussion. If you have more ideas on things we can change, please let us know! We want to see this subreddit booming again with EXO-L who don't just lurk. That being said, a lot of you said you are lurkers but you want more EXO-L interaction - Please be sure to use the Casual Convos and discussions to talk more &lt;3 !

However, once I actually became a fan, I started meeting schoolmates who liked Kpop (I assumed they all knew of EXO) and they had more friends who liked Kpop and the chain went on and on. I started noticing the picture of Baekhyun taped on a locker that I wouldn't even have noticed before lol. There's a Korean club and an annual cultural event where at least one group performed only Kpop (and always included an EXO song!) I found OT12 EXO on pillows while out and about in Japantown and there were booths selling EXO and other Kpop merch at a street fair. I'd say Kpop is definitely well known in the teen community in my city and thus EXO isn't a foreign name. I hope they'll hold a concert here one day :)  


So how well known is EXO in your community? Have you maybe done something to make them more well-known around you?

109,2018-7-12,2018,7,12,14,8y6wuq,Did you stick with your original bias up until now or did you switch?,Xaille,1531372392,"Hey guys! Really curious on what people's bias experience is!

Personally, I've stuck with my bias. 

And I've probably wrote this in so many posts already but I'll always type it out and it'll never get old haha. I saw Scarlet Heart (Baekhyun's drama) and he got me back into Kpop and I discovered his group is Exo! I remember when they debuted, I had literally watched MAMA and dropped out of Kpop probably a couple of weeks later since school was ending and I got busy and all of my Kpop friends had already graduated. I'm so happy he brought me back because I've had the best year of my life! (I'm almost hitting my 2 year mark!)

**HOWEVER**

There was a phase where Xiumin was *really* wrecking me. Like I thought I was about to switch biases, every time Jamie (our lovely owner) posted a picture of him or sent me some gifs I think I died a little inside, he is just so attractive and it's crazy how he can just completely capture your heart. And then there's .... D.O.. oh boy. He's also another one to just absolutely kill me and it hurts SO MUCH.

**BUT** 

Baekhyun has prevailed and risen to ultimate bias, how about you?",39,21

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #172!

I'd like to open the post up by asking everyone to check their heart rates: are we all good and accounted for? Because after the first two ElyXiOn \[dot\] concerts, I'm honestly not sure mine is doing so well. You can get caught up on Days [1](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1017640294207008768) and [2](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1018180578019962880) here, and I'll update with the third after the weekend is fully done! Between all the spicy solos and adorable photos, I'm not sure I'm ready to say goodbye to ElyXiOn Era yet. Which stage is everyone's favorite? Are we all [going crazy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxdIjxSwRdM)

EXO is officially now the first non-royal figure to ever be projected onto the Burj Khalifa, which is the world's tallest building! It's truly an honor that we have our fanbases to thank. Even the [boys](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlOBHqol-qi/?taken-by=weareone.exo) have seen the news themselves! How exciting!!! 

Make sure to follow [Lay](https://twitter.com/LAY_zhang_) over on Twitter at his new official account! Word around the block is that if you tweet him ""#balance"" three times in a row, he'll RT you. Don't quote or blame me if he doesn't, though.

As a final note, I just wanted to alert everyone to the 2018 Census results as well as new sub changes! We have adjusted our rules regarding our submission titles, allowed content, flair system, and more! [Please give it a quick skim](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8x750o/rexo_census_results_rule_updates_general_changes/) so we can all begin sharing and talking a lot more about the thing that makes us the happiest: our wonderful boys\~

Please introduce yourself down below if you're reading this but haven't ever commented here\~ ;)

How is everyones week going? 

Thank you for reading,

I think that if I had to pick, I would my favourites would be a toss up between Xiubaek's Battle Scene and Chanyeol's song Hand. I think the battle scene didn't get a lot of attention because no fancams could capture it in the way that gave it justice, but finally seeing it in [HQ from the elyxion in japan](https://streamable.com/51j2d) concert made me really realize how great it was. I really liked to see XiuBaek being able to show off their dancing skills in a different way and this was the perfect way to do it I think. Chanyeol's song Hand was just so emotional and I am so happy that he was able to perform his own music for us. ",11,20

Did they film this while they were still ot11/ot12 and just cut Kris and/or Luhan and hide them with camera angles and stuff??

They dont deserve the energy of this subreddit. But again, thats just my humble opinion on the matter.

But by all means, please keep it coming!!! Meanwhile, [Chanyeol and Baekhyun](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlflGbCnZ5K/?taken-by=real__pcy) are working out...which is a whole different type of heart attack...also Baekhyun [PLEASE ](https://78.media.tumblr.com/effedf800d5d453e0b1d06d0c521d0bd/tumblr_n66h3zpW8x1sgyexeo1_250.gif)wear closed-toes shoes in the gym.. &gt;.&lt;

Kris' show [Rap of China](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/90rhcp/180714_kris_the_rap_of_china_season_2_episode_1/) just launched their second season! Be sure to tune in! Any guesses on what this season's buzzword will be? I give it at least 1-2 more episodes before he says something iconic yet again. Freestyle, anyone?

On an entirely different type of stage, [Suho](https://twitter.com/SMTOWNGLOBAL/status/1020265044376936448) is [stunning audiences](https://twitter.com/XiuhanForExo/status/1020008926144757760) in ""[The Man Who Laughs](https://twitter.com/suhoperior/status/1020969039273709569)""!

TT\_\_TT Of course our musical aficionados [XiuChen](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiiudVPU8AEmljD.jpg) went to support him! 

[Baekhyun](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1020685831504138240) kicked off SM's new Station concert series with his first live performance of [Take You Home](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/90t212/180721_baekhyun_take_you_home_the_station/)... is anyone else in their feelings?

Than I immediately went ok, any of them seriously??????? Lets be real here, I will happily get stuck on a deserted island with any member or all members. But for fun discussion's sake I guess I will pick: 

* D.O: We will need someone who I know will get creative and figure out how to take care of us. Kyungsoo seems like the type of person who would take charge, fix any problems, make sure we were eating etc. He would be the first to figure out shelter and food. 
* Baekhyun: We need comedic relief but I also will need someone who will also cry with me about being stranded on an island probably without our phones. Plus, having him there to sing is like an extra added bonus.
* Xiumin: Ok I know its not a big surprise I picked Xiu, but I originally wrote down Chen because I need someone who will be positive throughout it all, but as I typed out my response for Chen, I immediately remembered how Xiumin made it his life goal to kill a moth that got into the house on It's Dangerous Outside the Blankets. So Xiumin will be protection from anything that could come and try to hurt us, ie. bugs. 

Well there you have it.. now it's your turn.. ***If youre stuck on a deserted island, which three EXO members would you want there with you?*** ",37,13

If you somehow do not know of this legendary card, [this is it and it has changed my life for the better](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSDCLBUUIAAeOgi.jpg). ~~I've honestly looked around and I can't buy this pc anywhere and it is only slightly (horribly) disappointing :(~~

It is honestly so sosos cute and such a Kyungsoo thing to do he's just a big ball of squish ^I ^cry

All the memes that came out of this photocard.. [are nothing short](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSS4bVxVwAAni9A.jpg) of pure [legendary memes](https://pm1.narvii.com/6692/211347bee79b08a5f17ace3a020d3300b0d9725a_hq.jpg)

A close second is Chen's Blooming Day [photocard](https://78.media.tumblr.com/8217a599d5655b4175cfa000dc751720/tumblr_p70ow41U6s1v88r1oo5_r3_1280.jpg) - with the green shirt and earring and I don't know what has me so obsessed with that photocard but IT IS SO GREAT AND IT ALSO A CARD I NEED TO HAVE IN MY LIFE! I call it my Bowling Dae card ~

I don't know how the boys continuously take such good pictures, but overall I think The War had some of my personal favourites for every single member. Such pretty pretty cards~



I could in all honestly continue naming my favorite photocards but (if I don't see Xiumin hugging a teddy bear or Suho beret I'll be so very sad) I want to hear your favorites! Any reason why you like a certain photocard the most?",15,17

First of all.... A VARIETY SHOW! 

I would love a series where they all get their pets and play with them, re-introduce us to them. I mean.. I might be a little biased since my love for animals is infinite but more than a popular established idol show I would totally want this. Just the thought of seeing EXO and their pets is making me melt. And just because Chen or Lay don't have pets (or maybe they do we just don't know) I bet they'd love playing with animals too! [Chen](https://pm1.narvii.com/6259/822ac809f90fc761160fdc3b91fb7273f6355f9a_hq.jpg) and [Lay](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgjAKeUUcAAFGkM.jpg) would go around and hug every single animal they see.

What are some of your favorite things about EXO and their pets and what/who do you want to see more of?",14,20

I was only there for a short moment of Xiumin's insta, but it really makes me wonder what kind of content each member would post. Like Chanyeol said Baekhyun's insta is more casual everyday life, Sehun's is kinda abstract, and Chanyeol wants to show stuff others can't see. Kai's definitely developing his own style on Instagram as well. 

We know Suho has a secret Twitter, but if it was public, what would you think he would post? I'm thinking maybe his usual boyfriend pictures on the EXO-L website as well as **memes** As for Kyungsoo, maybe some of his food or more forehead selfies?

Well, I hope this doesn't end up lost and forgotten hehe I would really like to have new exoL friends that tell me any gossip they find out about the boys.

So, back when EXO debuted, I was a hater lulz I was a hard YG-liever stan back then and since SM was the main competition, I hated everything that came from SM. I was that kind of delusional fan back then. Nowadays I just like what I like haha

So I hardcore ignored EXO for many years until last year. 

Big Bang was kind of death, 2ne1 died also and neither winner nor ikon managed to really catch my eye. So one day I remembered this beautiful ff page (aff coff coff) and I decided to log in after years of inactivity to remember all days haha I saw a HunHan ff and started reading it. I had to google both Luhan and Sehun because I didn't really recognize any of the exo members haha and then I fell in love with that ship. (I little much too late I know hahaha)

Anyhow, I started reading more and more hh ffs, I got to now all of the members that way haha I really liked the personalities portrayed in the ffs so I started watching their MVs and TV shows to compare. I wanted to write my own HunHan ff as well so I needed to do some research. Sad to say Sehun doesn't really match with the way people describe him in ffs but IDC haha I love him regardless, he is my ultimate bias ever now, after him comes Chanyeol, and then Baekhyun. OC Luhan would be first too, but since he left :,c

I got a little offside track there but well that sums up how I fell madly in love with exo hehe

PD: I am sooooooooo excited for ChanHun's station X song. I CANT WAIT ANY LONGER FOR THAT RELEASE! 

PD2: English is not my native language, it's spanish, so bare with any mistakes I may commit please.

PD3: If you know any good Sebaek, Hunhan or Chanbaek (sorry, I don't really follow or read any other ship :c ) ffs don't hesitate to send them to me ;D I can recommend you a few good ones too.",1,1

Also something that I came across recently from Lay's [recent interview here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vhqe9eikmT3aUzofn9Nhpe5ZGMifk1LV/view): I don't think any of us had realized that Kai had had a surgery for his back/waist.

234,2018-8-24,2018,8,24,9,99svcq,What type of concept do you want to see EXO do in the future?,joyceberry,1535071275,"Now that we've got some confirmation of an upcoming comeback (we knew it was happening but hey, a news statement never hurts), I'm itching to know what our boys are going to tackle next. After Kokobop and Power, I feel even more than usual that the sky isn't even a limit for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially for the fall, I kind of want to see them in stylish nerd concepts? Like JCrew with lots of wire frame glasses. I feel like it could go well with a \~vibe\~ R&amp;B type of song, something a little more subtle but still with that catchy earworm. Dean/Heize ""And July"" comes to mind even though this entire concept probably wouldn't work very well for a promo cycle considering the type of music and dance EXO usually comes out with looool. The joke's on me because this is just an excuse for me to beg for more [glasses!exo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/7a/96/fb7a96ebb9e17e959b8482691c285022.jpg) hehehe

&amp;#x200B;

I also saw someone on Twitter talking about how they wanted a super sweet concept for EXO! Which, I don't think will ever ever happen but imagine an intentional aegyo-filled dance routine? Too powerful.

&amp;#x200B;

It's honestly a bit hard to even think about possibilities for them. SM always comes up with such creative concepts, things I've never ever think dream of in the first place. So...nerds it is ;)

I'm curious, what does everyone else want to see from EXO? I know y'all are 50x more creative than me!

&amp;#x200B;

I really really love to swim and so if we were to hang out at the beach and do those inflatable sport things on the water I would want to spend the day doing that (they are really so much fun believe me) I would imagine a mix from their Dear Happiness DVD and D.O.s, Chen and Kais third box DVD where they had their water competition. 

For both of those DVDs they looked like they were having so much fun in the pool and out in the water that it would be such a fun chill day you would want to collapse on a sofa at the end of the day. Play jokes with each other on the beach, play volleyball, guitar when were all relaxing outside of the water. 

Aaah if it wasnt on the beach I would definitely say going to a lounge cafe would be my second option because they always have those big fancy couches you would all squeeze into together and such sweet drinks (Im not a coffee person Im sorry) and it would be so warm and relaxing. 

What do you like to do that you would like the EXO members to join you with! Is it shopping at a mall or maybe going skiing with Baekhyun and Chanyeol? Cute cafe with Xiumin and Luhan? Or arcade with the maknae line? Lets be real anything you do with an EXO member would be so fun~",26,13

I'd really like to see them on Super Junior's Super TV! Imagine SuJu and EXO just playing games with each other.. goofing off. All those interactions at SMTown concerts brought to life in every single moment of the show. That's what I'd like to see. A show where they're super comfortable with the hosts, one where they can just goof off. 

Usually, I'm not very into watching things, mainly because my attention span is super short and I tend to get sidetracked easily. But I recently watched this episode with Red Velvet and actually paid attention the entire time. I think that's the charm about this show, it's that you see these veterans of Kpop talk and interact with the newer groups and seeing genuine laughs is everything I want from a show.

So what do you think their next variety should be? Or maybe even two... three?",11,12

In light of the majority of EXO member's decisions to no longer receive birthday gifts, EXO-L from EXOcord &amp; /r/EXO have teamed up to create a Birthday Project for each EXO member that will benefit more than just the KPOP community. Going forward, for each member's birthday we will be collecting donations for a different charity of choice voted by our discord &amp; Reddit members to than donate in each of the EXO member's name for their birthday. So far this year we have donated over $1000 to several charities in EXO Member's names including the World Wildlife Fund and Make a Wish Foundation.

Chen's birthday is coming up on September 21st, and we have decided to handle our birthday project a bit differently this time. We have found this amazing organization that plants 1 tree for every $1 donated. Because of this, we will be hosting the fundraiser directly on their website.  

We would like to donate the money we raise to Brazil, so if you are able to even spare $1, please select Brazil in the drop down.

With that in mind, I thought we could start a new discussion series where we talk about different things from EXO's personalities, to best songs to start off with, to best dances etc in order to help these people who are only getting to know EXO now. It can be so intimidating coming into this fandom, especially since EXO has a huge discography / filmography + so many members. So let's get started! 

**Week One: Introduce the EXO members as if you were speaking to a new fan!**

Make it a few words, a few sentences or a novel if you like! Also, if you are a veteran fan, don't forget to talk about KrisLuTao, we need to continue to educate new fans on who these members are. ",16,35

# What is a Season's Greetings? 

Season's Greetings are put out by fansites every year, they typically they have two different sets you can buy, one being a desk calendar (or wall) and the second being an agenda 'diary' that you can write in. Both feature lots of images that have never been released online and some that have. All of these orders come with more than just the calendars too, they also come with stickers, mini photo cards, pins etc (check the gifts column!). If you have a fave fansite for your fave members, this is a great way to support them in attending events and gifting things to EXO members. 

# The Masterlist

This year we have decided to make a handy spreadsheet of all the season's greetings that are being made. As fansites release info, they will be added here along with links to group orders that you can get them from! If there is a particular country you would like added for a group order column, please say what country you would like in the comments below\~ 

Please note, some of the season's greetings listed up already close at the end of September, so you will need to get your order in soon! Also, if you don't see your fave members or fansites on here, keep checking back, not all fansites have posted their season's greetings yet!

Happy ordering!!!

They love it so much that there's an entire physical (multi-level) [retail shop](https://www.soompi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SUM-Celebrity-Shop-540x405.jpg) in Korea filled with unique merchandise, specifically designed to thin our wallets out. While the merchandise can either [hit](https://img.kpopmap.com/2018/06/exo-korean-official-goods-1.jpg) or sometimes be [a miss](https://img.kpopmap.com/2018/06/exo-official-japanese-goods.jpg), there's no end in sight to the things SM can slap EXO's names on.

&amp;#x200B;

As a collector of photocards and other EXO things, my list of treasured merch is quite high, but I genuinely think some of my absolute favorite pieces of all-time are the recent 6th Anniversary goods, specifically the [medal](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaMJI1SUwAEDdxF.jpg) and tumblers ([front](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaK0a0xUwAAjRyr.jpg) and [back](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/1a/9e/461a9eeb83691344ef017825632fdca1.jpg) for your viewing pleasure). The items themselves are so gorgeous, well-made, and really meaningful because they celebrate such a milestone for our beloved boys. Another cherished piece is the [ElyXiOn in Japan hoodie](https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2017/12/14/exo_planet_4_elyxion_in_japan_hoodie_1513234563_965050b6.jpg) that reminds me of one of the most incredible moments in my life, and an unforgettable concert experience. Plus it's practical, which is always a wonderful bonus!! 

&amp;#x200B;

Comment and let me know, what's your favorite piece of EXO merch that they've released, or that you own? Something you've always wanted to have [but can't find](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0770b89affe9fc256f3e34d403261ec6/tenor.gif?itemid=9084254)? Something you wish they'd just listen to you and make already?!

**If you missed last week, here is what this series of discussions is all about:** With a new comeback lurking, we have many new people with their eyes on EXO wanting to learn who they are and what they are about but it can be so intimidating coming into this fandom, especially since EXO has a huge discography / filmography + so many members, so we have started a weekly discussion thread called the New Fan Series. We will be asking a series of questions to help new fans get to know EXO better!

i've seen EXO in berlin last weekend and i thought they were looking exhausted and stressed out a bit and i thought it was because they were preparing for their comeback. i even think i remember reading about an upcoming comeback but i can't find anything about it anymore (or i'm too dumb to look for it).

has there been a change in plans or was i wrong to begin with? it seems about time for a comeback. ",3,5

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are mine:

1. Ko Ko Bop - 394 plays
2. Monster - 384 plays
3. Boomerang - 286 plays
4. Lotto - 182 plays
5. Mask (Lay Solo) - 149 plays

Oh my god. Seeing KKB as my first, I am literally [this girl from the Berlin music show](https://twitter.com/minsikai/status/1041387533995831299) LOL. Although in my defense, I do replay the last 30 seconds a lot just for Ksoo's part &lt;3 Monster and Lotto, I'm not surprised to see on the list. 2016 was the year I dove into the fandom and I just immersed myself in their songs released that year. Boomerang and Mask too, I'm not surprised to see because I love those songs so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually expected to see more of EXO's R&amp;B to show up on my top 5. Those are some of my favorite EXO songs but I guess I don't play them as much as I thought! Though to be fair, I do skip around within songs a lot when listening to them, heh.

A few years back (I'm unable to remember the exact year, sorry!)

The song was fairly high, however it wasn't a high note.

41,2018-10-5,2018,10,5,6,9lgahs,How do you think Sehun can improve his dancing? [ Warning I kind of ranted ],SnowBrokkoli,1538689813,"Before I start this, likely very long vent, I want to preface OH SEHUN IS MY ULT. I am not specifically into KPOP or the concept of having a 'bias', but Ive sat through every clip I could find of this man and I am madly in love with his personality. I could go on for hours about it, but Ill get to the point. 

I love watching sehun dance because I love him as a person, Im thinking of whats going through his head and enjoying his performance from the view of his personality, but as a dancer, theres a lot to be desired. I dont know much about rap, and he really barely sings, but dancing is his claim to fame and the one Im most interested in. I get emotionally invested in his performances because I like him as a person, but fundamentally his dancing bothers me and often gives me second hand embarrassment. 

I dont want to compare him to Kai or someone like Taemin, because the only person you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday, but watching those dancers gives me strong emotions. Perhaps Im biased as someone who does ballet? But their dancing is in a different league and it upsets me.

I want sehun to improve, I absolutely dont want him to leave exo and I dont think theres anything wrong with 'just being a pretty face' ( seriously, have you heard of a model? ), but I want to cry over his performances because they struck me deeply, I want to look forward to his dances instead of being afraid of what people have said about him, or the second hand embarrassment Ill endure. I want to point at a fundamental skill and say, 'thats my bias'. I want him to get praise he deserves and smile about it and own his style and evolve as a dancer. Not essentially for exo, but for himself as well.

With all that said, I think his main issues are his height and stiffness. 
Shorter dancers can stop easier, meaning they dont have to slow or change their movements. They have great control and coordination, they can switch between fast and slow much easier and have confidence in their movements. As I said, I dont like to compare, but Kai IS only 1 cm shorter than Sehun. However, he does have a lot more muscle, which creates better lines and gives him more control ( not to mention his YEARS of experience over Sehun ). You can see Sehun's dancing has improved as he's gained muscle as well, so Im not saying his height is an excuse, but its a huge factor in dance. If he can control it, he can use it to his advantage. 

Stiffness. His height contributes greatly to this, but the rhythm barely moves through his limbs, his spine is very stiff and straight at all times, which affects his hips, shoulders, ect. Its hard to become captivated, as the smooth, fluid lines he's meant to be creating, become jagged, awkward movements. 

Along with those, theres lack of expression, which personally I LOVE, but is very necessary for an immersive dance. Even just the shimmer of an eye can make such a drastic difference, immersion in the music/movements is vital. There's also possible shyness, Im sure he's seen some of the comments on his dancing, and I notice he's super quiet on stage. He seems to perform much better in groups, and even better in the practice room. Also, lack of experience. I dont know much about Kai's training, but I've heard he was doing intense dance from a young age ( using Kai again because everyone LOVES to pit legends against each other ), and it really shows. It seems no one has really taught sehun these things, or, he has yet to fully adapt to them. Which is fine, I dont want dancing to become a chore for him if it isnt already, but Im so so desperate to cry at one of his performances, and not because of the quirky things he adds into his dances or for teasing another member. 

Once again, I dont mean this in a rude way at all. I just want to hear everyone's opinion, Im very passionate about this topic as a sehun stan and a dancer. I really hope he's practicing hard ( but also resting ). ",18,1
42,2018-10-5,2018,10,5,7,9lgndj,What is your favourite performance/song from The War/Power of Music era?,carinabon,1538692453,"Hello everyone! 

As Kokobop/Power era closes and we are that much closer to getting our comeback, the comeback stage and everything that comes with new music! [(NOVEMBER 2nd !!!!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/9l8646/exo_comeback_master_post_dont_mess_up_my_tempo/) 

I wanted to pose the question: ***What is your favourite performance from the last era, it can be Kokobop/Power/The Eve or any song from The War or Power of Music.*** 

Personally, I cannot get over this stage of [The Eve](https://youtu.be/EqqEZyjG6ts), also specifically [Kais fancam](https://youtu.be/q0ucNFChHo0). It is such a *stunning* performance and an amazing song/dance. I think it also really captures the era very well as their outfits are so very kokobop, they all look so incredible on this day, Xius yellow blush ^(helloooo) . **170724**, an iconic day, *(Just as an aside,* [Chanyeol](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ccfe0fb6d832f2264a1214f6c0294bb/tumblr_otxtbydhHj1riav2to1_1280.jpg) *with that hair and his contacts makes me want to jump off a bridge, how dare he look so good).*

Did you guys have a favourite song from The War/POM? I think mine is definitely Sweet Lies, I am such a sucker for the low-key vibes from this song. I find their voices so stunning in it, but the rap might be my favourite part. Theres also something to be said about Xiumin and Chanyeols voices harmonizing, it gives me chills. 

Looking forward to reading what you guys have to say! ",8,1

**Here is what this series of discussions is all about:** With a new comeback lurking, we have many new people with their eyes on EXO wanting to learn who they are and what they are about but it can be  intimidating coming into this fandom, especially since EXO has a huge discography / filmography + so many members. We have started a weekly discussion thread called the New Fan Series. We will be asking a series of questions to help new fans get to know EXO better!

So I'm wondering which one was your favorite so far? Why? Is it one particular stage that made it all or was there a combination?

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite would have to be the EXO'luXion tour. It was the first concert tour that I experienced with EXO and it couldn't have been better. I remember they performed El Dorado, My Answer, Playboy, Exodus, Hurt and Promise before they were even officially released! They teased us with a short performance of CMB even before they came back. It was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hype. Like imagine watching the performance of El Dorado and Playboy and you had no idea at all what was coming.

We were gifted with the El Dorado performance, these [wine red suits](https://78.media.tumblr.com/82b53ddce447fff8021dd6e14363d78a/tumblr_nrml9vRoEy1sgyexeo6_400.gif), [playboy in these outfits](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ad264c33b6ed7142c7aada17b91406c/tumblr_or3yk1uSBR1tytutbo1_400.gif), these [freaking](https://i.gifer.com/Tw8i.gif) [surprises](https://78.media.tumblr.com/789e4cf5c4437a8bedb1094bb4d3eada/tumblr_nl7sxfMAjJ1u964tfo1_r1_500.gif)???? and of course [Baekhyun on the piano](http://mblogthumb4.phinf.naver.net/MjAxNzAzMTBfMjU2/MDAxNDg5MTU3NTcxNzY1.2XGO6ve3MYzck8L4SVB0CLyO2dnLv2nMvL6-Fwdfg7gg.g2u1_FWRlV1QWeenM1ihXFu33kz2jKiYW2i3HtrJgPkg.GIF.cbchan0830/C6eZilUU0AAEawJ.gif?type=w800). I think these stages really showcased how magical they are when they perform as a group. The stages still blow me away all the time.

They won **The Best Concert award at the 4th 'E-daily Culture Awards'**.

**Here is what this series of discussions is all about:** With a new comeback lurking, we have many new people with their eyes on EXO wanting to learn who they are and what they are about but it can be intimidating coming into this fandom, especially since EXO has a huge discography / filmography + so many members. We have started a weekly discussion thread called the New Fan Series. We will be asking a series of questions to help new fans get to know EXO better!

# Masterlist:

I just want to start off by saying I am a casual K-Pop fan. I love and appreciate the music that has been/currently is out not just from Exo (favorite group), but to other groups in general. Anyways, my girlfriend and I are extremely exited for Exo's ""Don't Mess Up My Tempo."" My girlfriend's birthday is coming up soon, so I thought, ""why not get her Exo's upcoming album?"" After checking out the album packaging, they all look really nice! For some reason I'm hesitating to pick a version. So I wanted to hear your guy's thoughts? Which version should I purchase for my girlfriend?

**Thanks in advance!!**

Going forward, for each member's birthday we will be collecting donations for a different charity of choice to than donate in each of the EXO member's name for their birthday. So far this year we have donated over $3000 to several charities in EXO Members names including the World Wildlife Fund and Make a Wish Foundation.   


For the month of November we have 2 member birthdays! Kris is on November 6 and Chanyeol on November 27. We have decided to raise money to donate to **MusiCounts** ([https://www.musicounts.ca/](https://www.musicounts.ca/)). They are a music education charity in Canada that is affiliated with CARAS and the JUNO Awards and believe that all children &amp; youth should have access to music education. They provide instruments to those who need it and also sponsor school music programs and award scholarships. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because we have 2 birthdays in the month of November, we will be making the donation on the later of the twos birthday -- Chanyeol. We are aware it is comeback season so money is tight for everyone so our goal is going to be smaller this time. If we raised **$250 we can donate 3 Ukuleles.**  


**How we collect:** We are using PayPal Pools in order to collect for these donations. A link will be posted for each PayPal pool for the different Birthday Projects. You can donate any amount (even $1 helps) at any time until the deadline date. Your name will not show on the feed, so don't worry about doxxing. If you are cautious about donating to us, we will post all receipts showing which charity we have donated to. We have chosen to use Paypal Pool to donate to since it is against PayPal's policy to profit from this system and they can shut down the account on there if it is used incorrectly. In the case that the money is used incorrectly, the pool will automatically be shut down and the money will be returned immediately. Please note, Unfortunately PayPal pools is not a tool that is available in ALL countries around the world, so if you would like to contribute and you are from one of these locations please send myself or /u/99101004  a message

    Deadline:

November 26 

    Donate here:

&amp;#x200B;

I cant believe youre only 28 and have accomplished so much in your life. You finally released your long eagerly awaited album Antares AND IT COULD NOT SOUND BETTER!

It hit #1 in many countries and we could not be any prouder for our King of China! There are seriously not enough words to tell you guys how proud I am of Kris to finally release this album. This is all him, his work, dedication, time to perfect each song and each minute. There is not a single song by the end of the album that I did not like and this is all Kris (one critique, I am waiting for another '[Time Boils The Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp-wyHzQx4k&amp;ab_channel=KrisWuFrance)' Mr. Yifan.

You killed it in America by performing at the [MMVAS](https://youtu.be/S_XBVGPio8M) and you also attended the [AMAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6YrpUVEniE&amp;ab_channel=%E8%92%BC) (button up your shirt baby you looked COLD)

Youre the ambassador for so many high end brands like Louis Vuitton and now (NEW!) Chivas Regal! KINGS ONLY?

YOU PERFORMED IN THE [SUPER BOWL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkiRnHvDEJc&amp;ab_channel=Becca)!?! I still cannot believe you got invited to perform and was a huge success. I am so proud of you

You constant impress and serve during your show Rap of China and every performance leaves us [CRYING](https://twitter.com/wu_yi_fan/status/1048561795344920576) boy if you don't STOP 

On top of that Kris performed for CCTV [Chinas National Day](https://twitter.com/wu_yi_fan/status/1046328134214156290) and although I might have cried your mullet makes me cry harder.

I dont think anyone can swoon more when seeing Kris play basketball at the [Super Penguin Celebrity Basketball Game](https://twitter.com/wu_yi_fan/status/1040915422856372224) also nothing was weirder than seeing Kris and Justin Bieber play on the [same court together](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWMvHj-VMAAislq.jpg).  




&amp;#x200B;

Kris I adore you, I love you, you giant 6 foot something tall man of pure sweetness even though you act to like suave WE KNOW YOU. Keep doing what you do, strive for what you believe in and don't change for anything. Your fans (hehe) are always right here beside you and will support you!

&amp;#x200B;

Happy birthday 

  
  


Leave a happy birthday post or one of your favourite Kris moments from the past year!",3,1

But what is this promotion period?? There are no variety shows and SM has cancelled most of the other music shows, leaving only like Music Bank left. Plus, when KBS released the Tempo showcase, they made the title weird, making it difficult for exols to find. 

Also, one of the best producers, Marz, is leaving SM. And also EXOS ar team is bad. 

Honestly hoping Lee Sooman comes back as CEO because future EXO comebacks arent looking so good.

But this week our whole song's sales and charts should account for the win, so I'd imagine we'd have pretty high scores compared to Inkigayo. 

Could we clean sweep the wins this week, and possibly the following week? We are doing amazingly well 700k in just 6 days and doubled our youtube views compared to kkb.",5,1

Anyways, after I heard CMB a while later, I was looking it up and saw this [pic](http://save0506.tistory.com/m/36) in one of those lyrics vids. Bc of his voice and that specific pic, I was reminded of that kpop group, History (specially this [song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0z0MA1lwIKA). Like their style was similar to his look in that pic, so I literally thot Baek would be a serious and more manly idol.

Its stirring up some crazy debate and opening my eyes to a lot of people's music taste and its just a lot of fun. So lets do this: 

***EXO has an amazing discography, we all know this and I am not discrediting it BUUUT if you could delete 3-5 songs from EVER existing, What songs would you delete?*** 

A few things to keep in mind: 

1. Try not to think in terms of language versions here - like you can't delete Love Me Right \~Romantic Universe\~ but keep Love Me Right Kor/Chn versions. 
2. Pick between 3-5 songs! *You know you want to. Don't be giving me the whole ""well I like EVERY exo song EVER created"" There has to be even 1 that you skip all the time.* 
3. Keep it nice, don't trash the song because you like hate a member or something ridiculous. 
4. This is only counting EXO's discography, no solos, no subunits (no cbx)
5. If you have explanations as to why you would remove those songs or why they just don't suite your taste, please explain\~ If not, just make a list!

My wife is a big EXO fan but has limited luck in finding merchandise. We've casually browsed Amazon/Ebay, but didn't see anything too exciting there. We've also been the k-pop store here in Chicago, but that seemed to be nothing but BTS. 

She's predominantly looking for clothing (with the black jerseys from the Exordium/Tokyo concert priority - ebay has something similar but they look like knockoffs). Is there a trustworthy online kpop site for EXO Merch?

We'll also be in Japan in a few weeks. Are we likely to encounter a lot of EXO merch in Ktown/Shin-Okubo or is BTS just going to dominate all the shops there as well?

Any help is much appreciated. Thank you!",16,1

Our happy virus, EXO's #1 hypeman, our man who is as soft and sweet as cotton candy has turned 26!

&amp;#x200B;

As per r/EXO tradition, here are a few of some of the things Chanyeol has done throughout the past year that makes us unbelievable proud of him!



Chanyeol attended Yoo Heeyeol's Sketchbook recording and he [looked](https://twitter.com/Precioso1127/status/969961644808785920) absolutely beautiful, but he [sounded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOdZHSasqgg&amp;ab_channel=KBSKpop) even better. Hearing him sing makes my heart just FLUTTER.

He travelled to Shanghai for the Tommy Hilfiger Fashion Show ~~which astounded all of us~~ and maybe looked [utterly](https://twitter.com/Caramel_CB/status/1037019478633017344) model [worthy](https://twitter.com/flechazo_pcy/status/1037279654569103360). Aah my [heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Kx-KIcilo&amp;ab_channel=cbsoup)\~



Chanyeol hypes up EXO like no other, [cheering](https://twitter.com/milkysehun412/status/995607817603158016) on CBX in Yokohama, [visiting](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh0vOHLnbJm/) CBX when they were on MBC Music Core with Suho, supporting EXO's leader Suho when he [released](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgI9Jy-n2p6/) '[Dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHj0S8-hwQU&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN)', [supported](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnI1bRUnc1w/) Baekhyun when his song '[Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RduG3VkgnrU&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN)' with Loco came out!

My favourite Chanyeol is when he shares his music with us through [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/realpcysc). ([This](https://soundcloud.com/realpcysc/0lfrflz88e3g) song and [this](https://soundcloud.com/realpcysc/0lfrflz88e3g) are my favourite &gt;&lt; I get ridiculously happy hearing his work because he is so talented and he is proud to show it off to us. His Instagram [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5HcrhFPCDc&amp;ab_channel=whyhahm) he did on the 26th of November is who he is, a soft boy who wants to share his work with EXO-Ls\~

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

I hope our Chanyeol was filled with love and happiness today! 

Make sure you see our birthday [donation](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/a0gile/exol_from_rexo_exocord_donated_385_to_musicounts/) post to MusiCounts, we raised $385 for our sunshines Chanyeol and Kris\~

EXOcord (our Discord server) has been working on a [fansite masterlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1me5mj6fEJMNHH2qaaOuHCzAZSFMeTEs0augv-hlbotQ/edit?usp=sharing) for the past few weeks now that we just launched this past week. On this masterlist you will be able to find a list of fansites for each member with all of their active SNS accounts linked. At the bottom of each page you will also find a link to a Twitter List that includes all the fansites listed on the sheet. 

Keep in mind that this spreadsheet contains exclusively active fansites and all fansites who have not updated their SNS with new photos for 6 months will be deemed inactive and, in consequence, be removed from the list. We will try our best to keep this masterlist as up to date as possible, however it is not guaranteed that we will have every fansite listed so if you see/know a fansite that is not shown on the spreadsheet do not hesitate to comment here and we will gladly add it! 

A huge thank you to /u/kagomefantasy &amp; /u/asilxxy who undertook this huge project &amp; made this for everyone. ",3,1

125,2018-12-13,2018,12,13,7,a5n7i3,EXO is now 8 members. Let's discuss.,Mgpiglet98,1544654338,"(Please, if you are going to bash and argue and be a bully, don't bother commenting. I know everything there is to know and I won't be changing my mind. I just want to know if anyone else agrees. I'm aware many disagree. Be polite with your opinion no matter what.)

I have been an EXO-L since the hiatus between MAMA and XOXO. I've seen the members leave and I know what a member leaving or slowly phasing out looks like. 

I'm not mad at Lay for having a solo career because I support Kyungsoo as an actor and the other members doing things. I feel like Lay just has no interest in being in EXO anymore and should stop making excuses for not participating in their group comebacks. 

EXO have been presented to us as 8 for two years now and they never say that they're missing a member. (Yes, they've talked about Lay but not as an EXO member.) They seem to purposely say all members in reference to there only being eight of them. They never say ""all members except Lay."" It seems to me that they have accepted he doesn't want to be with them as a group anymore. 

I think the only reason Lay continues to say he is a member is because of his contract with SME and also because he would rather not rock the boat until he can quietly leave the group (as in, wait for contract to expire and leave.) I don't think he wants to leave the company, just EXO, but he can't because of contracts. 

If anyone else supports EXO as 8 and believes Lay isn't interested anymore, tell me your opinion. ",4,1

187,2018-12-17,2018,12,17,8,a6txrj,Whats going on with SMs lack of EXO promo?,chacha1993,1545001557,"SM continues to treat them like shit. Obviously not surprised, but as a huge fan of them, its upsetting. 
Theyve only done 3 music shows and the last one was today. After the way Tempo got shitted on, I had higher hopes for Love Shot to be promoted more, and now its already over! 
EXO is still SMs most popular group and they still bring in more money than anyone else. So why the bad treatment? 

Are they:
-trying to make room/give more attention for newer groups like RV and NCT by ignoring EXO? (I know this is a trend with SM).
-trying to bully EXO into resigning longer contracts? (I heard this happened with SNSD)
-not wanting to waste money on promoting EXO when they know people will buy their stuff no matter what? 
-punishing fans for boycotting certain products after the poor treatment EXO got during Tempo promotion? 
-something else?????

I just need answers. I know no one really has them, but what do yall think? 
As a big fan of EXO, this is incredibly frustrating. ",9,1

For always trusting and cheering on us, thank you so much!   
Do you know? of the truth that everyone should be happy for us to become happy!   
Therefore, let's be happy together\~ &gt;.&lt;   
What would it feel like to have a loveshot with EXO-L...? Perhaps I'd be happier?!   
In anticipation of that day, even harder, let us! love each other 

[**Baekhyun (Translation by @\_b\_bh0506)**](https://twitter.com/_b_bh0506/status/1077067826811232257)

&gt;Our Eris!   
Youve been looking forward to this a lot right? How is it? Do you think its good?   
I hope Eris like our song a lot .   
Im sorry to keep you waiting and i love you!!   
Lets do a 'LOVE SHOT'\~ &gt;\_&lt;

&gt;EXO-L's who've always been waiting, cheering us on and giving us strength from the back    
Though it's hard to express my thanks through words, I cherish EXO-L with a thankful heart.   
Whether on stage or preparing for the album, I'm working hard with that heart in mind\~!   
In the future too, please take care of me  

[**Chanyeol (Translation by @teapani)**](https://twitter.com/teapani/status/1077056303531384832)

&gt;Hello it's Chanyeol!  
There's not long left until 2018 is ending  
Everyone who spent 2018 with EXO, how was it?  
It was a very very blissed 2018 for me.  
Thank you for always being on my side  
I will always be by your side too  
Please keep that in mind!  
So until the end of 2018, in 2019 too  
Please be together with EXO!  
Love you, always

In the future too lets make a lot of happy memories\~   

[**Sehun (Translation by @SELUKAIS)**](https://twitter.com/SELUKAIS/status/1077071758971170816)

&gt;Thank you always   
EXO-Ls, who are always giving us strength/supporting us by our sides, are the best!   
I'll become a person who can repay you back.

&gt;To: EXO-L    
I still think that it's lacking even when I say that I'm always thankful...  
Because there is EXO-L, there is EXO   
Let's love for a long long time    
And even when we are reborn, let's meet again!  From. SHJM

[**D.O. (Translation by @inksoomissedit)**](https://twitter.com/inksoomissedit/status/1077061098749100032)

&gt;I sincerely thank you for always liking EXO without change and we will continue to repay you through our great sides. Thank you EXO-L!

I am a new EXO-L and this era was the game changer for me (always loved EXO since debut but never bought their albums because i always knew they would repackage albums after the original versions). Tempo &amp; Love Shot make me wanna buy this album just for those songs (tho Ooh La La La is awesome too). But i guess all this weird promo for this edition confirms my theory: What if Vivace Version was gonna be released with Allegro, Moderato &amp; Andante but with that issue between Korea &amp; China (can't remember the actual name of the issue) Lay wasn't allowed to even appear in photos? And correct me if I'm wrong, but i read an EXO-L's comment that apparently this ban of the Chinese artists in Kpop was lifted so maybe that's why SM released Vivace Version after Love Shot. Anyways, feel free to tell me if my idea for the album was better and if you agree with my theory regarding the delayed release of Vivace Version, or if it was intentional to release it later for Holidays.",3,1

So hi, EXO-Ls!!! :D Anyway, are there any collectors like me that only collect the best edition of the albums (aka repackages) or do you guys buy every edition there is of their albums? I used to buy albums randomly without checking but ever since i became a serious CD/movie collector, i have the belief that i should only buy the best version from the get go so i don't have to double dip later on with the same album with extra songs. Oh and i have no problem with people who can buy every version (the collection videos on Youtube are breathtakingly beautiful). I just wanna know if other fans think like me so i don't feel like i'm the weird one in this vast community of EXO collectors :3",9,1
346,2018-12-29,2018,12,29,16,aaja82,Which should i buy?,JCFT199523,1546069032,"Option 1: Don't Mess Up My Tempo (Vivace Ver.)
Pros: OT9 Photos.
Cons: released after Love Shot but doesn't include the Love Shot bonus tracks.

Option 2: Love Shot
Pros: most complete version of the album with 15 tracks.
Cons: No OT9....(Lay isn't my bias but i love having the group being complete after 2 years.) 

I usually just buy the repackaged albums because they're the most complete (and thus the best) editons of albums but i'm conflicted here. I know Lay is only in 1 of 15 songs but i love seeing him there and i love both Tempo &amp; Love Shot. I want both songs! Should i make an exception to my ""only repackages"" rule and buy both? ",8,1

We started in March of 2018 and over the year together we donated a total of $3040 to 6 different organizations around the world. 

This year we are planning to do things a bit differently:

1. We will be hosting a 1 YEAR LONG fundraiser for the organization, [One Tree Planted](https://onetreeplanted.org).
2. The staff will be hosting giveaways for EXO Fan Artist Commissions for those who donate (This means we will be giving away 12 fan artist commissions in total, 1 for every birthday).

**Why did you pick One Tree Planted?** [For Chens Birthday in 2018,](https://onetreeplanted.giv.sh/fundraisers/fnd_e8f0594fa769cbce) we donated to this organization and we fell in love with the initiative and work that they are doing all over the world. To make it simple: They plant 1 tree for every $1 that you donate.  

**I will donate less if we are only donating to ONE charity.** In order to keep you interested, for every member birthday we will be changing the area in the world that we will be donating to. One Tree Planted plants trees ALL over the world! For example, for D.Os birthday we can donate the trees to California and for Chens birthday we can donate the trees to Vietnam. 

**I dont want my money to sit for 1 Year!** One Tree Planted actually gives us the ability to host the fundraiser right on their website, meaning as soon as you donate money it goes directly to them rather than having anyone on our staff be a middle person. 

**Why arent you giving away albums anymore?** We would like our project to benefit EXO-L as a community too. Therefore we think that giving away commissions to your favourite EXO-L Fan Artists will have more of an impact on peoples lives than giving away another album that you probably already have.

# We really would like to hear your feedback on this before we launch this project within the next week, so please comment below or message the mods :) ",2,1

Lay went to America and the [best interview to exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jujiQQU_9Rs&amp;ab_channel=BuzzFeedCeleb)hit the internet at buzzfeed.

Chanyeol invited EXO-Ls to celebrate his [birthday](https://exo-l.smtown.com/Board/Details/9551111) with him, or as I say, him showing off his halloween costume since he wasn't able to before (all jokes aside we got soft) and a thank you to Suho for MCing!

D.O. attended the [Blue Dragon](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1065993930586505217) Film Awards.

To celebrate the fantastic year by our lil actor Soo\~, lets go through some of the amazing things he has done in the last year!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

When Kyungsoo STUNNED us all during these photoshoots in [High Cut Kor](https://twitter.com/EXOXOXOID/status/1070096163221594113) and [Allure](https://twitter.com/allurekorea/status/1066930527536467968) magazine.

When he won the '[Popularity Award](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1048154856790380544) at the BUIL Film Festival\~  
The animated movie he was in was also shown in [China](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1017016872259055616) and it won the Best Animated Feature Film Award at China's [Silk Road Film](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1051848773989588997) (first ever in Korean Film).

'Along With The Gods 2' has reached 10 million movie goers in just 14 days. [It is the first franchise to have 10 million tickets sold in each movie.](https://twitter.com/EXOnaverTrans/status/1029289554174308353)  It also [surpassed 13 million views](https://twitter.com/SEHUNBUBS/status/953118041046368257) as of 16 January, landing them 4th place in the most watched movie in korea, surpassing ""Monster""  


Kyungsoo sang '[First Snow](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1066092987619266561)' and gave EXO-Ls the SWEETEST VIDEO TO EVER BE CREATED on the first 2018 snowfall in Korea and I kid you not when you fall more in love with him once you see it.  aw soo singing soft

He won the Best New Male Actor award for his role in 'Along with the Gods'

&amp;#x200B;

D.O. was the lead male actor in the drama 100 Days Husband where it has done exceptionally well, even reaching a peak [16.7%](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1057412967749181440) viewership. He even he taught the rest of the cast [the choreography to 'Growl'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_pma9bK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be) after it surpassed 10% viewership.

He is in the movie Swing Kids where he practiced tap dancing, learning a North Korean accent and somehow attending a million showcases. Swing Kids was ranked [\#3 in Top 15 Korean Films of 2018](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1077174570975547392)

We cant forget this BRILLIANT tap dancing performance at one of the [Swing Kids Showcases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8_QYjzdSxI&amp;ab_channel=DOMENT) (I love only one main dancer).

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

He puts everything he has into being an idol and an actor that he excels exceptionally in both. I am proud to call myself a fan of EXO's D.O. and actor Do Kyungsoo. Share your happy birthday messages to our Squishy Soo!

Each and every year he surpasses expectations (his and our own), lets take a look at just a few things he has done to take our breath away!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

In February he stunned us all when he took [solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgW1kv82Ku4) stage at the PyeongChang [Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkIsg_RzPlA&amp;ab_channel=MORPHEUS)! He looked absolutely breathtaking, and the happiness that radiated from him when he came off stage makes us feel even more ridiculously proud.

Kai was in a Japanese drama called [Spring Has Come](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31617b5935b9fee02cff04767afb68b4/tumblr_ozvet4ngaB1riav2to1_1280.jpg) as the male lead!

He (along with Suho and Baekhyun) attended the Commemorative Medal Ceremony to congratulate EXO for being quadruple million sellers and we couldnt help but awe when the announcer said [EXO-Ls](https://twitter.com/LayIsMyBae_/status/1080773746804379648) find me a sweeter boy.

Kai was casted in the drama [Miracle We Met](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/59/fc/ad/59fcad4fb66383312dd973191919c0e4.jpg), and oh boy if you have not seen this God (quite literally), I implore you too.

Our fashion genius went to Paris for the [Gucci 2018 Cruise Collection Show](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002313112995786752) (where everyone had promptly lost their collective minds)

Gucci King also went to [Guccis Hyundai Department Store Renewal](https://66.media.tumblr.com/98f4863f8318f7d004c4a399832260cc/tumblr_ph2bx1IFnw1vnak7xo1_1280.jpg) and to top it all off in September he came back to Paris for their [Spring/Summer 2019 Collection](https://66.media.tumblr.com/de8a79d9328d957d8e619e95f46ff1be/tumblr_pfws5dsBIj1vnak7xo1_1280.jpg)

And to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-VX60sGRjo&amp;ab_channel=Mr.Destiny) from Kai's fansite jonginnet (Mr. Destiny) for being posted on social media and reaching 1 million views and going viral in South Korea. Proud of our trending dancing bear!

&amp;#x200B;

My first song was 'Mama', but I didn't really *hear* EXO until 2016, when 'Monster' was out. 

BUT I would totally have to say that CBX were the ones that got me listening more EXO. I rejoined the Kpop fandom literally 2 weeks before the first CBX album came out and when I heard and saw the styling of 'Hey Mama!' I fell in love, I had to get to know this group better. What kind of music does the whole group make? Who are the rest of the people they know? Who's that guy with the red hair (Baekhyun hehe)? I've got to say I owe my EXO love thanks to CBX releasing that album, that song was such a great way to get me back into Kpop\~ It's kinda funny how my first song was 'Mama', but it was like CBX was yelling at me 'Hey Mama!' for me to come back haha and now I have an entire hours worth of amazing songs from EXO to listen to forever\~

&amp;#x200B;

So what song got you into EXO? It doesn't have to be solely an EXO song (aka my story above) it can be a solo, a cover, anything, let me hear your story!!",176,1

Figaro talks with Oh Sehun.

&gt;  
His instagram having over ten million followers, the group that he is in achieved sales over 1.1 million for their 5th regular album, and he has won AAA's popular actor award through the drama he was in... Being in an idol generation, Sehun makes us full of curiosity about him, how does he regard the high level of attention from the outside world? What kind of person is he like away from the camera? This time, Madame Figaro is here to convey this true icon's style, attitude and thoughts through images, the magazine and interview/talk with him.

I personally think Baekhyun would be amazing as a soloist. He's shown so much growth as a dancer especially with CBX. I also would love for a Chen or DO solo debut. They have amazing vocals and I love Chen's OST songs! I also am wondering if Xiumin or Suho will get a solo debut since they are enlisting soon and each Shinee member has released a solo album before enlistment.

As for subunit... there have been a lot of rumors for SKY (Sehun, Kai, Chanyeol), which would be awesome! I love Sehun and Chanyeol's ""We Young"" single last year. I would also love a DO and Chanyeol subunit!

Some of the usual popular ones are [kai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-VX60sGRjo)'s [fancams](https://youtu.be/s8bnKjuaZAw). One of my fav live perf's is this [Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0YayoPk1jg) perf.

Some unconventional fancams include [Transformer in Mexico](https://youtu.be/YcvkE7D7v4U?t=147) where the music cuts off but they continue to sing and dance flawlessly! Also this acoustic stage where DO is suppose to hold the mic for Chanyeol but [keeps forgetting](https://youtu.be/jFcjrrJd3zs?t=186). I also love this fancam where [Suho breaks his mic](https://youtu.be/HURlFnFRK28?t=100) but continues through their last perf of the event with the [cutest expressions the whole perf](https://youtu.be/sXeds7meMxk)!

The trial started today and will be live-streamed today and on March 8. However, the defendants (who didnt appear in court) argued their actions were partially due to their poor background. In response, Yixing asked that their fine be lowered from $50k USD to $10k USD. A lot of people are upset and saying hes too nice, but I think its also partly a strategic move.

Don't just think about your favorite song, but also think about what kind of songs would fit him. Let's be honest, he can literally pull off any genre, but think hard, what song do you think he could do the BEST at? 

Personally, would love to hear him cover (and this might be recency bias since the song came out a couple days ago) [**Lovedrunk by Epik High**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Vz-ptyKbQ)! I think his voice would be so good with the rapping in this. The robustness of Chen's voice able to go very high and so soft would be perfect for this song. He has so much life in his voice and the riffs he would add in would be absolutely amazing.

Let me know what you guys think!

Please tell me your reasoning, what style/how he'd sing it in and if possible, give us a Youtube link so we know what song you're talking about!",9,22

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Q: The photoshoot started in the afternoon. What did you do before getting to the venue?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Because I got up too early, I went to play basketball, had lunch, and even went to an oriental clinic, which was quite diligent of me.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then the swelling (tn: that youd have after waking up in the morning) must have disappeared by now? (laugh)**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Ive been starting a new diet that matches my body. I usually would eat meat but they said it wasnt right for my type of body (tn: probably metabolism). They said that I should plan my diet primarily based on seafood and white rice now. Ive been eating carbs, which I wouldnt usually eat before, so my body is a bit swollen.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: In one of your previous interviews, you said that one of your mottos is to be present at the moment. What side of yourself do you want to present in todays interview?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I need to be present at the moment but I probably worked out too hard in the morning, my eyes cant be all shiny now (laugh). But fortunately I think my current state matches the concept of todays photoshoot too, so I guess it did my body some good relaxing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You recently attended Bvlgaris B.zero1 20th anniversary event in Rome as Koreas representative.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: It doesnt happen everyday that you are invited to attend an overseas event. So it was an experience full of amazement and fun for me. It was also the first time I ever went to Italy so I took the opportunity to enjoy Rome to the fullest before coming back (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youre also known as one of the humorous members within your team. I feel like I know what that means now.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I havent even started though? Im talking in all seriousness right now (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you normally wear jewelry too?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I have great interest in fashion, but I wasnt that acquainted with jewelry. There was one time when I accidentally had a scratch on my neck during a dance session, so I became more careful after that. But then thanks to this event, I got to wear rings and necklace(s), and they seemed to look nice on me. Hahaha  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Yeah I watched that live broadcast where you showed your ring too (laugh).**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: It kinda matched the look that I went for that day so I wanted to brag a little bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You did some travelling with your friend after finishing the schedule, normally its not easy for you to travel around, isnt it?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I do travel once in a while. Ive been planning my vacations ever since the 4th year after my debut. I personally love travelling, so I took the time to form a group with my friends and travel every year. But still, this was the first proper Europe trip with a friend.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Not only Rome, you took your time to travel every corner of Venice too. Whats your travelling type?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I wasnt the type who would plan my itinerary so thoroughly in the past. That resulted in me belatedly knowing that the place I just came back from was a very famous place, or there was a god restaurant near my hotel that I passed by without knowing. It was kinda upsetting and such a pity. (Because) When would I ever get the chance to visit that city again. Its really true that you only feel and see as much as you know. That was when I started to plan my travels and do my research diligently before going somewhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Where was the most memorable place from this trip?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: My favorite spot was Colosseum. We unintentionally went there 3 times, but if it makes you go Wow\~ looking from the outside, once you get inside, it gives you this unexplainable vibe. I didnt have my expectations high but once I was inside, the scenes from the movies , , the series came to mind one by one and matched with what I saw, so it was a very interesting experience. It felt so incredible, the fact that thousands of people from the B.C times would come to this huge building, sit here and cheer as they watched the matches.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats your next destination?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Im thinking Paris. Ive been there once but I just travelled around without a guide, so its a shame that I couldnt feel much. This time I plan to go on a guided tour and also visit the nearby city where Van Gogh, my favorite artist, used to live before he passed away. And to view his artworks too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You put Su-hwak-haeng in your instagram profile. Whats your trivial happiness these days? (tn: su-hwak-haeng is a wordplay with so-hwak-haeng, which stands for the guaranteed happiness that comes from small/trivial things)**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think I just feel happy after having a day a little well-spent. When I lie on my bed before sleep, watching Netflix, after spending time well. That really is the moment of happiness, isnt it? (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats Suhos typical well-spent day like?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I do a lot of sports, including fitness. Also for my lyrics composing, whenever I come up with something, I write it down. I meet my friends, we watch movies and share our stories, too. Or if theres someone in the group with an audition coming up, we would help him with script reading too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Throughout the interview, I kept thinking that you reminded me of someone, then I realized that your voice or your vibe really resembles your close friend, Byun Yohans. Do you grow to be alike as much as you are close?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: My brother said the same thing too A few people said something similar too. Is it because I do script readings with him frequently (laugh)? But as you get to know us, we always have big differences.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Is there something youre into these days?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: These days its basketball. My goal is to work hard and level up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats at the center of Suhos life at the moment? Have you ever thought about that?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I have my personal ambition regarding acting so Ive been participating in musical and movie works, but the fact that Im EXOs Suho before anything else doesnt change. Also during this Italy trip, I got recognized by many people, I think it was because Im EXO Suho, and the invitation that I got to attend an event overseas was also thanks to my EXO title. Thats why its only natural that I always keep EXO at my center.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: We all know that you call yourself the funniest member in EXO. How would you define your gag code?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Our fans call it the gag pristine area. That its the kind of gag where I dont devalue and hurt any certain person, but only make fun of myself. I personally thins such a innocently funny thing. In itself, its a kind of heavens-helped gag (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you know that the very fact that you are explaining it right now is funny too?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sometimes there are people like that too. They say that whatever I do is just funny. When we did the photoshoot sometime ago too, it seems I was quite interesting. The photographer said that I was interesting even when I just stood still.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Arent you proud of yourself at times like that?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Of course Im happy (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Who has the best understanding of this gag dimension of yours?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sehunnie really likes it. Our codes really match well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then whos the most incompatible member?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its Chanyeol. Chen used to not match either but now hes come to understand my code (laugh). But Chanyeolie seems to never get it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I think its not an overstatement to say that the relationships among EXO members now are like a family. When are the times when you are reminded oh so well that As expected, we are one team.?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Recently we got the chance to gather all the members after 2 weeks. It was such a happy and interesting time. Of course we ended up playing games that time too, and I dont know why but I ended up last place.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Was it because the members kept tackling you?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think eventualy its because I take it well. And my reaction is good too. You know there are also people who pull a stern face and hate it when you joke around. But as for me, I dont act like that as long as it doesnt go too far. I think they tend to especially act like that more because they want to see my reaction  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Dont you ever think I want to get down from the leader position now?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont know if its because of the years weve been working, but now be it the members or the company, they always come to discuss with me first. But these days Ive been thinking, that even if I werent the leader, they wouldve done that same. Its tiring at times, but at the same time its rewarding too, that So Ive lived a good life. I dont think the situation would change much even if I were to retreat from the leader position now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If theres something you wish from the members as the leader?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: We play games a lot, but I wish they started to learn how to lose now. You know people say losing is actually winning. To be honest, there were many times when I intentionally lost. More that feeling happy from winning in a game, I would hate it more to see the members who have strong desire for winning being upset from losing. Rather than I need to win even if I have to die, it feels more at ease to just let others win (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I guess its the leaders consideration.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its just my personality. Ive been like that ever since I was small. Even when we played games where we bet a jjajjangmyeon, my friends would fight and end up injuring themselves. So I never joined (such games).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whos the EXO member with a particularly strong desire for winning?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Its Chanyeol (laugh). As for me and Kyungsoo, we have no desire to win, nor are we interested. Anyways, my hope is that they would learn the happiness when you lose intentionally for others sake. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Just 1 year after you challenged yourself in the musical field with in 2017, you ascended to star in . You even won yourself many newcomer awards. It must mean that you got your recognition now, right?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think to some people, Im forever an acting idol who came from an idol group. Thats all the more reason I feel thankful being awarded. Because it means that I got recognized a little as a musical actor. I know very well that with every award comes the responsibility and pressure, so I need to work even harder in the future. Because Im a new actor who just starts now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youd hinted a few times that you wanted to work with seniors. Now that it finally came true, what did you learn from them personally?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Ive learned so many things. Jung Sunah nuna especially pointed things out and helped me meticulously. She would make precise comments like You was slower than the beat in here. Even in the middle of the actual show too (laugh). I learned a lot from observing how the seniors did it, and all the process of working together together with them became such great energy to me. I was able to learn from watching carefully every move of Park Hyoshin hyung as he did it. Haha. I think I worked hard to try to catch up through that process of watching them for reference, then reinterpreting it in my own way.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: 2018 was a year that you worked hard not only in EXOs activities but also as an individual. What kind of plan do you have for this year?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: So far theres no exactly finalized plan. Its just that I really want to work on a movie or a drama, and a musical is a good idea too. EXO also has plans to show various sides of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If you could choose, what kind of face would you want to meet the viewers with?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont particularly look for a certain character. But I do hope that its not one that is too stiff. I want to act someone whos flexible, mischievious, and shows their emotions well. But I dont want it to be another cool character again. Because its kinda burdensome. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats the picture that Suhos visualizing for the future to come?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I want to become someone of positive influence, who sets a precedent. So that I can become a senior who starts and paves the way for my junior colleagues, and is of help to them. For instance I can be of positive influence to my fans or others just by donating or making a volunteer organization. Also, if in the past, when you say you want to be awarded at Cannes or the Oscars, it would be common for people to tell you to stop dreaming, but now, that thought is gradually becoming something realizable, not a dream without any hope. I believe that someday a Korean will make it. And the junior actors who see that will be able to dream bigger dreams.

To our eldest member in EXO who looks like he just turned 19! Our trending fairy, sold out fairy\~I hope our precious man spends his birthday surrounded by everyone he loves!



Lets get into it! In case you need a reminder of the power he holds, here is a confident man who wears [10k](https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006HnQKyly1fne6cp00e0j30qo140do5.jpg) jackets while performing, [yeah he runs this show](https://streamable.com/4mqmb).

&amp;#x200B;

Our Minseok opened his very own [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/e_xiu_o/) (and sorry every other exo member) HE WON. Despite forgetting his password every other week he posts the [BEST](https://www.instagram.com/e_xiu_o/) pictures ever recorded on this very earth. [This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403707315439796224/559883060137558019/DmqACbjUUAEg_Oa.jpg) was his first ever picture posted (now deleted unfortunately)

&amp;#x200B;

For CBXs Japanese album Magic released in May, Xiumins solo [Shake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY3dUUQdFOU) literally shook me (I am so sorry I had to).

His very own song Beyond was revealed during Elyxion, and SM posted a great video for their [BEATBURGER PROJECT X XIUMIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4E4PmHGD0c).

CBX's Blooming Days era was also a personal favourite to many Elsa's for the reasons like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK45XM7v8v8), and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403707315439796224/559892480661913611/x19.gif). His vocals were beyond amazing, his dancing looked better than ever (he is a main dancer!!!!!!!) and he started to open up so much more on variety shows. Try not to fall in love with him I DARE YOU!

&amp;#x200B;

Minseok is the very PURE definition of successful fanboy, look at all these posts:

[Changmin](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjzlGF0l-dt/) posted this photo on his Instagram, [TVXQ's](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjzjNoqHHNb/) Instagram posted this and [here is another one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjziYE0nwW3/) of him and Yunho!

He even went on '[I Live Alone](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btpfax7HbEn/)' with Changmin!

On top of being a successful fanboy, he is also a great supporter for his members, seeing Suho in both '[The Man Who Laughs](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1020257144824713216)' and '[The Last Kiss](https://66.media.tumblr.com/76e9b79615ec065f3fce02a8c60ab5e4/tumblr_p31cbhukOo1qhmxnlo1_640.jpg)' (to name a few instances)

&amp;#x200B;

When EXO decided to do a VLIVE for EXO-Ls after their DMUMT comeback, and he did most and the [CUTEST](https://66.media.tumblr.com/165a36d2e560c5457e9166d76c15b196/tumblr_plwnieNhJC1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg).

I would also just like to thank every deity for this look when he (and EXO) went on [Mugi-Box](https://66.media.tumblr.com/886aa6514b060e25a5a47795bac6e231/tumblr_plcl9e90xn1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) to promote 'Love Shot'.

&amp;#x200B;

To end it off, Xiumin released his very first episode of [Heart 4U](http://www.vlive.tv/video/119817)! 

This genuinely warms my heart because he is a very private person, and he allowed all of us to see what the inside of his house looks like and I will be forever grateful for it.

Im doing a college research project on Exo fanfics (comparing ones featuring heterosexual love to ones featuring a pairing within the group), and have noticed that gay exo fan fiction seems to have more mature writing (not in terms of smut but in terms of the writing quality and the subtlety of ideas/themes and descriptions). I was wondering if you guys could tell me which type of exo fan fiction you prefer and why (if youre able to pinpoint it) and if any of you guys get the same vibes as me about writing style differences or have different thoughts on differences between the two genres?

This thread is the place on the subreddit where you can discuss anything you like! Tell us what is going on in your life or what you are loving in the world of KPOP &amp; EXO lately. The universe is the limit.

**Here are some highlights from** [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **from the past week:**

* We closed[Xiumin's birthday project and ended with a total of 715 trees donated](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5rit9/exocord_and_rexos_xiumin_birthday_charity_project/) to help rebuild forests in British Columbia, Canada!
* [Xiumin posted on the LYSN app for his birthday\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5s421/190327_xiumin_lysn_fansite_update_to_my_butterfly/) We're all now Butterfly EXO-L's
* [Heart 4 U Episodes](https://channels.vlive.tv/DE441D/home)! If you haven't seen them, you definitely should! Get a glimpse into Xiumin's life and just giggle and cry over how amazing and cute he is! 
* Tao released ['Once Beautiful'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKXLjB3Fm4U) and wow it is so soft, ballad Taaaao 
* Suho and Kai went to the EXO's Ladder Celebratory Press Conference and [took pics with some lobsters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D26B-N5U0AAidAw.jpg)...
* [It was Lay Studio's 4th Anniversary!](https://twitter.com/layshands/status/1112380834626064384)
* Multiple EXO members had photoshoots and videos drop this week for various magazines:
   * [Chanyeol for 'Art in Paris' Naver x Dispatch](https://imgur.com/a/wJxwsbn)
   * [Xiumin for Harper's Bazaar Korea April 2019](https://imgur.com/a/NAEGmhE) 
   * [Suho for W Korea Video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BviUDfng5yB/)

&amp;#x200B;

**And of course.... Chen's debut is this week (basically today in Korea) and the MV dropped earlier!** 

* The ['Beautiful Goodbye' MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrOrlhjIYVk), which is basically the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Also, you need to watch it with the lyrics FOR SURE
* [A LIVE busking!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5y4bn/chen_to_have_surprise_busking_event_chens_april/) Now, before you riot and go ""OMG SM SUCKS WHERE IS THE PROMOTION"" hear me out. This totally sounds like something Chen would want to do. Can you just imagine what that'd be like? Chen's voice resonating throughout the crowd and especially now that we've heard the song, can you just imagine all the tears??? How amazing it would be on a spring night to be swaying to Chen's amazing vocals? Yeah. Picture that before you get your pitchforks! 
* Comeback stages yay yay yay! KBS Cool FM, Song of Hope, Music Bank, Music Core, and Inki\~

So everyone, what is going on in your lives? What were some of your fave things that came out last week? What are you looking forward to the most next? Excited to hear from everyone, hope you had a fantastic weekend!",5,12

Look how fond [Baekhyun](https://66.media.tumblr.com/61c850987b88d02e890ce03f9606c392/tumblr_p8329h4CXw1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg), [Xiumin](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b823bb5a7f87654dca1b29faac221663/tumblr_p832a2WVqy1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) and [Chen](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e7f82af318d9c9ccec37ea0d93422c7/tumblr_p832a9suVJ1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) look? Sehun is the [absolute](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba7b3df9192725a6990e542f78eb224/tumblr_p7rdiht9TN1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) [cutest](https://66.media.tumblr.com/895cd5be52206b9287b9ab5115b5a8d7/tumblr_p7rdipvalh1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)!

Our loving Hun also went to support our leader, Suho, at his [musical](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a8e28087072051e10385bde91631d4/tumblr_pcvv0wpCPq1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)... He was undoubtedly really happy to see Sehun and was quoted saying: Thank you to our maknae Sehunnie who came to see me today! Love you! We are one loyalty.

His loyalty knows no bounds, look how cute he is supporting our Chen's solo album [debut](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3j_LLwWsAkiBfu.jpg) with D.O.!

How happy his costars were when they were at the press-conference for '[Dokgo Rewind](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MvRuOd8dJu4mShYiBPxww6Fs2jKrAZ8H)' (we can all [relate](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7273d91b5189a69da516f257c294683/tumblr_pnlassIoXG1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg))

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about how Sehun dominated fashion this year with his attendance at the [Louis Vuitton 2019 Cruise Collection Show](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002312960901971968) (yes he did [THAT](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7248379b1fd923cb18d401978ef6c5cc/tumblr_p9t26xbGsd1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)), did so many beautiful covers for magazines and collaborated such as [Figaro](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1XujnCUwAAieqT.jpg) and [Cosmo China](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1_aZ7wUgAAEKvS.jpg). Even becoming the face of [Ermenegildo Zegna](https://twitter.com/OhSehunGlobal/status/1042371470079549441)!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's not forget to mention the HUGE success he had with the Station X 0 song with Chanyeol called '[We Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EgY4Arwv9E&amp;t=0s)'! Especially at how fun he had performing it on stage for us at [Elyxion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6ZgdURif0)! We need more!

&amp;#x200B;

A happy Sehun is a happy EXO, Baekhyun was more than happy to have Sehun on to play SM SUPER CELEB with him, even taking the cutest [polaroids](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9718edad08d37a4fc6f4b21d4d8d531/tumblr_peo40gT5s51qhmxnlo2_r1_1280.jpg)! [Please](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdd71572c54d70e23770d9e37e034fd6/tumblr_pgeaeuS96Q1qhmxnlo4_r1_1280.jpg) keep them [coming](https://66.media.tumblr.com/357639af3b88f76054cf71fa5f89633f/tumblr_pewgzfwCLh1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)!! (and getting the best [selfies](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b40b5c6583249d95e3ce3681df51bb7b/tumblr_penfqpf1NT1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg), need more [proof](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd52181c021520102b4748d2495f8f50/tumblr_pev5wywfND1qhmxnlo2_r1_1280.jpg)?). 



Thank you to our Hun for always being the best maknae EXO could have! We are eager to see what this year brings you and will support you indefinitely! Leave your well birthday wishes for [our cutest](https://twitter.com/412code/status/1097430905080098816)!",5,39

Can people update me on what they think are the most important things that have happened in the last 2 years, including member activities and memes and jokes that I might have missed? I sort of caught up on how Yixing isn't really involved w/ Exo that much anymore but any other news would be really appreciated.

140,2019-4-19,2019,4,19,9,besx32,Year In Review: What are your favourite Luhan Moments?,99101004,1555633640,"Happy birthday to our shining deer Luhan!! *^((well tomorrow, I may be a few several hours early ;) ))* 

To celebrate our [favourite colonel's birthday](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/d7/60/d8d76047e12ee2ecdb75f34545b30461.gif), let's go over some of the things he has done in the past year!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

***A YEAR OF MUSIC***

Our deer focused a ton on music in the past year including holding his 2nd tour around China called ['RE:X'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNjresIt8gQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) where he took over a month off of everything to focus on [practicing every single day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyEWxBSbxPU) for it. How amazingly beautiful is his [yellow ocean?](https://twitter.com/luhansbody/status/1060947781676756992) His concerts were a massive success to say the least!

Prior to his concert series, he released the most beautiful ballad called ['The Moment'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKUlv923aHc) in the world for his fans. If you haven't heard it, be sure to go listen to it now\~

For his new years eve performance, he teamed up and trained with dance crew, [Kinjaz'](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsG3uRCBpPz/) to perform a breath taking dance focused stage\~ They later put out a [dance practice ver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb3H9VQuv_E) that will blow your mind.

Recently Lu released a new digital album called ['-volume.1'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFL2ev2pUNM) that sold [1 million copies in China in the first 45 seconds](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/184197328565/20190415-luhan-studio-weibo-update-1-the) of presale being released! In the first 7 hours, the album had over 2 million presales in China\~ The album was later certified that day with diamond certification and has become the singer with the highest number of diamond albums on the QQ music platform and also topped the best-selling list on QQ music.  As expected of our record-breaking deer!

***A YEAR OF TRAVEL***

It is definitely not unknown that Luhan has a massive fear of flying and heights. This year he proved us all wrong and went on a long (for Lu) trip to Europe.

He started off by attending [SIHH 2019 with Audemars Piguet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDXnls4trxw) as their [brand ambassador](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ba36fcdb03f41c5d4268d789b0bb964/tumblr_pl98dxmvUb1ralgblo8_1280.jpg). [Seriously, can he get anymore handsome?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeCYfSkgyyU)

And of course, what is a trip to Europe to Lu without a [visit to a ManU game](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs2QZj_AH47/) where he [sat in the stands](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1Etc_gZ4P/) and [cheered his heart out.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6c0e98277ab94ec2e27a6034be5e2f7/tumblr_plrqriTV341ralgblo5_1280.jpg) During his visit, he was [awarded the title 'Red Devil Messenger'](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/182476065145/20190201-luhan-weibo-update-reposted-1-2-3) for the charity work in soccer that he does in China as a ManU fan. He also got to attend practices with the team and take [Selfies](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d874bebc09742d7a2d4051def56af89/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo4_r1_1280.jpg) with different [team members\~](https://66.media.tumblr.com/667440a123492a424c42861b1643929d/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo3_r1_1280.jpg) [(what a fanboy!)](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b5dcbb78d4af4c9a9b6356346be07b6/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo2_r1_1280.jpg)

After his trip was done, he released a [short documentary series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBa9s1ROaKo&amp;list=PLALFiaYCl28XGqTNa-FpUeQG86WXF8Yhs) about his time in Europe -- Including his manager talking about how Tao &amp; Kris offered support to luhan when he was afraid to fly. They talk about how Tao actually spent the night and took him to the airport to help calm his nerves. We love EXO-M brothers!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Luhan for doing so much for your fans in the past year\~ It's been so lovely seeing you do things that make you happy! We are so excited to see what the next year will bring!

Did you all have a good week? I mentioned last week about how we hit 10k+ subbies, a***re people interested in us hosting another census?*** 

**Here are some highlights from** [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **from the past week:**

* We have opened up a new [introduction thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bdpl8s/rexo_exol_introduction_thread_7/) that you can all go introduce yourself in -- even if you introduced yourself before, go introduce yourself to the new subbies\~
* [We wrapped up our tree donations for Sehun and Luhan's birthday!](https://onetreeplanted.giv.sh/fundraisers/fnd_93693cd093a12383) Thank you so much to everyone who participated this time around\~ We will be continuing our year-long charity project but we have decided to hold our fundraiser for Tao/Baekhyun/Suho *^((May Birthdays!))* in July instead. We are doing this because we have had so many back to back birthdays lately and we want to give people time to get excited about the project again. :) 
* Luhan had a busy week -- [his birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/besx32/year_in_review_what_are_your_favourite_luhan/) and he released two new songs, [Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNl7jcno35g) &amp; [Imitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtNLkDBe88) \-- both will be released internationally ""soon"" but we have linked some youtube rips for those who are interested\~ 
* [Suho's Singles Magazine Scans came out\~](https://twitter.com/poco_a_poco_J/status/1119526433435467776) Of course he is looking as stunning as always!
* [Discussion of the week: EXO as characters in a Disney Remake!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bf84i0/exo_as_characters_in_a_disney_remake/) A hilarious thread that I never would have thought of, head on over there to give your thoughts!
* [Chen released a handwritten music video for his song Beautiful Goodbye\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxST4WC2awY&amp;feature=youtu.be) SM is feeding us so well?
* [Kris had his first concerts for his tour in China!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdjiJ3azJyM) ([KrisHunLip has been uploading fancams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6SgnWQ-vliDYCfsCAunjA/videos) etc that you can check out on their youtube channel!) He also released a hilariously cute song called [Big Bowl Thick Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCVwziYMq1E&amp;feature=youtu.be).

To celebrate our baby panda's birthday, let's post birthday wishes and favourite Tao memories below!



&amp;#x200B;

***A YEAR OF CHARITY WORK***

Tao had an amazing year in so many different areas of the entertainment industry but most importantly I want to share the amazing initiatives &amp; charities he was involved in this past year:

Our loving panda became [the special ambassador](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtKfY6dX4AAwbCE?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) for the charity plan [""Care For Future""](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1068143333178888192) by the China Education Development Foundation. They work hard to ensure children's safety and to prevent them from going missing and being bullied. You can [watch an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Nb5OEWGSY&amp;feature=youtu.be) he did after the event talking about why he thinks this plan is very important.

Not only did he focus on children's safety, but he also joined Tencent's charity campaign to [spread awareness &amp; help children who have Autism.](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1037283706677784576)

He also joined [Kering's ""Women in Motion""](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1007258616049516544) plan which focuses on the under-representation of women in cinema, both on &amp; off the screen. Tao felt so strongly about this, he flew out to the Cannes International Film Festival to [join in on panels](https://www.facebook.com/keringgroup/videos/1385109784967903/) in support of this plan. [You can watch his interview about the project here\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4mxHsjJfbY&amp;feature=youtu.be)

***A YEAR OF BRAND ENDORSEMENTS***

We all know how much Tao loves to shop. This year he added several big names to his list of brand endorsements. All worth checking out because damn, he makes all of them look amazing:

* [YSL Saint Laurent](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/989864669853569024): yes, this is when he said he would buy his girlfriend a WHOLE set of [YSL lipsticks as a gift](https://twitter.com/ztaor/status/1012230650378645504))
* [EVISU](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1024475489295974401): We love a brand that [spoils our panda!](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1041286249451929600)
* [KFC:](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1002372018816217088) which gave us [vampire Tao](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1052387693395697664) at Halloween time.
* [Sephora:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdX_nv_nmAs) I really loved [this moment](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1035466249830973440) of him explaining what 'Beauty is Freedom' means to him.
* [Sketchers:](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1034271152279932929) Name me a man that looks better in an [all green track suit while wearing sketchers](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1034271152279932929)??

***A YEAR OF MUSIC***

Tao released a lot of music in the past year which led him to win two awards at the China Music Awards. In his awards acceptance speech, he talks about how he has grown as an artist now and realizes that R&amp;B and ballads *^((hello exo style call back here, eeeeeee))* are what he is most suited to &amp; enjoys. Be sure to check out his new tracks from the past year: [Once Beautiful](https://open.spotify.com/track/6wIvrGxXqfliUqL5OK0qga?si=vLnj_PxUT5GURXPZIsyRzw), [Single](https://open.spotify.com/track/75yAi9tvheC4UMfMsUMIRo?si=SQ1vIdMqSwWhn8vV4a8sTw), [Breaking Up But Not Splitting Up,](https://open.spotify.com/track/4M6O2Eu68dkEsxNOAHPZpx?si=7tH_KUekQoOpeKwp1ZWVxQ) [King of China,](https://open.spotify.com/track/6DOI4qvH1qmXZXWWPTcDbu?si=be8GqJDJSbib0_qw66A4iA) [Stay Open (with Diplo &amp; M),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJq3WwxdcXI) [Silently](https://open.spotify.com/track/68KxkgqpjJwmNVAf3uRZyM?si=ReSrGymLSSC9MLiVyB9A8g) &amp; [Misunderstand](https://open.spotify.com/track/76FCccX2cOPTqakN4SANxH?si=amhK6ITyRSSa3xTdW6C10A)\~

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

What an amazing &amp; busy year Tao had and I didn't even cover half of it! It's been so lovely to see him so often and being open about so much. On behalf of the mod team here, we are wishing Tao an amazing year in 2019 and we can't wait to see what it will bring\~

I just got into EXO in the Tempo era, so I want to learn more about what I missed, in particular EXO-M - their friendships, the dynamics between the members and such. Can you recommend the best videos for this?",8,28

To celebrate his birthday, we have compiled a few great moments from the past year for Baekhyun\~ Feel free to leave all your birthday wishes and favourite Baekhyun memories below! 

 

 

&amp;#x200B;

***A year of new things!*** 

Baekhyun changed things up this year and started working on some new projects outside of the entertainment industry! Last year on his birthday he announced that he would be launching his own unisex clothing brand, Priv Alliance! 

The brand has been an amazing success and new lines have crashed the site multiple times ;) Oh the power of Baekhyun! He even took the time to fly out to LA to attend a new line launching presentation, and has modeled for each of the lines. We are so proud of you Byun! 

Not only has he been dabbling into the fashion industry, but also the gaming industry! We know how much our kyoong loves playing video games\~ He is now on his 3rd season of SM Super League where he streams &amp; plays video games with fans!  

Its so nice to see him out there interacting with fans as much as he can. He even opened up a Twitter account in the past year so he could talk to us more and regularly comes on instagram live to sing for us\~ 

&amp;#x200B;

***A year of music\~***

Well he may not have released more than [his collab with Loco this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RduG3VkgnrU&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN), Baekhyun has done lots for us in terms of giving us new music to listen to\~ 

He kicked off SM Station's new concert series where he put on a small fanmeet/mini concert for eries and sang [Take You Home](https://youtu.be/Pl16xHzys-I) &amp; Paul Kim's ['Rain'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5VwKFOuzsM). 

He showed us two new sides for solo music this year. First he dabbled into a more hip hop/rap focused song for [Ringa Ringa Ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08tGBKabcEE) on CBX's Japanese album, Magic; He said he was super nervous about doing this song since it is nothing like what he normally does! Than later that year he exposed a new super sexy side at The EyXiOn\[dot\] with his [solo song 'Psycho'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3O7NbXOYnk) that I am pretty sure is an all around fan fave now\~ *^(Come on SM let me fave a studio version!!!!)* 

 

 

&amp;#x200B;

What a super great year for Baekhyun\~ I am so happy to see him spending more time trying to get close and talk with exo-l and trying so many new genres of music! On behalf of the mod team here, Happy Birthday Baekhyun! We hope your year is as successful as the last and you continue to try new things.

I put up a listing on eBay recently for the EXO The War/KOKOBOP 4th album all 8 members posters. My ex got them awhile back through YesAsia when the album first came out. The poster tube is unopened because I didn't want them to get ruined! I've been in the middle of cleaning my place and realized I don't have room for it. 

As a fellow EXO-L and general kpop fan, I wanted to see if I could reach out to other EXO-Ls who would be interested in buying the posters to own or give to a friend rather than for reselling purposes which is why I'm posting about this on Reddit. I'm selling all 8 at once because they're all in the poster tube. The running price on eBay for a single poster from this album is currently $9.99, so I'm selling all 8 for $65 ($3 shipping).

If you have any questions about it, please let me know by responding to this! Thanks, guys!",5,7

99,2019-5-14,2019,5,14,2,bo6onc,Xiuweet Time Fan Account,greengoddess,1557769587,"A bit of background that may be useful- Im US based, Ive never attended any Exo event, nor attended any kpop related event, and Im obviously a huge Xiumin fan.

&amp;#x200B;

The tickets for Xiuweet Time were sold through Yes24 for 66,000krw or about $58 and required you to have a Korean phone number which I do not have. Pre-selling of tickets were only for Exo-L Ace members. As mentioned, I have zero experience in the fiercely competitive world of kpop ticket acquisition, so I had to do a lot of research.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:** I found different websites that help foreigners purchase things from Korea including concert/event tickets. I contacted Koreanbuddy and he said itll be impossible because of how strict they are with verifying identity. Gowonderfully was more willing to help. They were going to try to get me the ticket once it goes on sale on Yes24 and if that failed, they would look for 3rd party sellers. Gowonderfully is a time based service so I was paying them by the minute.

**Option 2:** The SM Global Package- if youre not familiar with this, this is only for overseas fans. Purchasing the package required an Exo-L Ace membership. The package for this event came with 2 nights stay at a hotel, goodies, a translation receiver, and the ticket to the event. You can choose between an economy package or a deluxe package, standing or seating ticket, and single or a twin.

Though I wasnt guaranteed to get a package- I decided to bite the bullet and get the Ace membership which cost $68.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ticket Sale Day:**

The tickets for the SM Global Package went on sale at 3pm KST which was 11pm for me. I got on the page, chose exactly what I wanted, got to the next page to enter my info, I was about to pay, AND it sold out. This was all in like 17 seconds from when it went live.

Thankfully, the kpop gods were on my side that day and I somehow managed to get the deluxe single package with the seating ticket- cost $699.

[Global Package options](https://i.redd.it/8no6k1gkl0y21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The global package also allows you to pre-order official merchandise. I got the mirror and the calendar. The calendar ends on December 2020- when Xiumin gets discharged. I wanted to pre-order the anorak too but it sold out so fast. Luckily, SM is selling Xiuweet Time merch online now because they received so many messages requesting them. I ordered a few more things and merch from Baekhyuns birthday. Dont ask me how much I spent in total. I spent way more than I shouldve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fan Meet:**

The night I arrived in Seoul, there was already a long line to pick up the ticket at the hotel lobby. The deluxe package stay was at the Imperial Palace hotel. The ticket was drawn at random, but the deluxe package guaranteed good seats. They also handed out the souvenirs for the global package which were a handkerchief, folder, and a mouse pad?- I dont know what its for. The SM staff all spoke at least 2 languages, I was pretty impressed.

On the day of the event, we met at the lobby around 2:30pm. The bus brought us to the venue and we tested out our translation receivers. It had 3 channels- Chinese, Japanese, and English. This was such a huge plus. I wouldve been happy just being there and not understanding anything. This made it so worth the money! We were brought in the stadium before anyone else. As we went in, we were given a Xiuweet Time transparent photocard and a phone holder thingy (I have no clue what they are called). SM is very strict about taking pictures. Cameras were not allowed in the venue and there were several people that were escorted out in the middle of the show with SLRs. If you were caught taking a picture with your phone, they tell you to put it down or the staff actually comes up to you and asks you to delete the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

[View from my seat](https://i.redd.it/35o2iqrbm0y21.jpg)

Xiumins friends that were on his Vlive show were there. They took up 2 rows in the center seating section. They all wore blue and white varsity jackets. While waiting for Xiumin they played Exo songs. They dimmed the light and played Moonlight- the crowd sang along so loud and waved their lightsticks. It was so pretty. Ill never forget the image.

Xiumin started the show by singing You are the One and debuting his gray hair. Gosh. This boy is so cute and smol. After that, was his 1st ment with Chen as the MC. He called Chen his part-timer. They played a boardgame that he had to finish in under 30 minutes or he gets a punishment which was a 10 minute live broadcast. He didnt manage to finish the game on time. He never did a live broadcast after that, but I think theyll release a special vlive thing or something.

While Xiumin was getting ready for his next performance, Chen kept talking to the crowd. He said he was on his way to the venue and saw so many people dressed in blue. He thought it was for the baseball game that was also that day, but then he realized it was for Xiumin. He called the manager to cancel his outfit and he wore blue instead. He even showed us his yellow belt because the dress code was blue with hints of yellow. The audience kept asking him to sing, but he said he wouldnt because it was Xiumins event and not his. Chen is such a natural at hosting. He can talk and talk- as expected.

Xiumin performed the Exo medley which was amazing. I dont even know how he had time to rehearse that while doing the CBX concerts in such a short amount of time. He was so sweaty after the performances. He even said he almost died. He also performed You, the Imagine Dragons song, Shake, and Beyond. After the last performance, he was taking the picture with the audience while we held up our sign.

And thats when Exo walks in. Everyone expected Chen to be there and maybe Suho, but all of them?? So many phones were out to take pictures- security couldnt even stop people at this point. Can I just say how much I love Kyungsoo? He is so precious.

Baekhyun took the lead in talking and he really tried to keep the mood light. Xiumin seemed fine at first- Suho, Baekhyun, and Chen gave their messages and he was smiling. Even before Kai started, Xiumin said I cant look you in the eyes. Kais message was so sweet and heartfelt. When Xiumin started crying- oh gosh my heart. He didnt just tear up either, he was literally sobbing. The audience was sobbing. I honestly didnt expect him to cry. Sehun gave his message and Xiumin was still crying. Kyungsoo was very Kyungsoo and said Aigoo- hes not leaving the country and gave Xiumin a hug. Baekhyun asked Xiumin to say something after Exos messages and he said he couldnt. He was really trying his hardest to stop crying. Baekhyun insisted and told him he had to. Xiumin tearfully said wait for me. There are good fancams of this moment. Watch it if you havent yet. Ive probably seen them a million times over.

After the rest of Exo left the stage, Xiumin asked us to forget that he cried and not tell anyone. He said he doesnt know if he can do his encore stage, but he will if we called out for him. He performed Dont Go to close the show.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an amazing time. Xiumin gave 100% and went above and beyond. It was everything I hoped for and more. I can't believe I got to see all of them. To me, the SM Global Package was worth the money. The whole event was convenient because they took care of the transportation, the merchandise, translation, and a lot of other things. I also met fellow Exo-Ls from all over the world. I dont have real life friends thats into Exo- it was nice being surrounded by people with the similar interest and to be able to talk about it. Ill be back in Seoul in 2021 when Xiumin is back for an Exo concert!!

Ask me anything- related or not!

As per usual, we're going to be talking about some of the amazing things Suho has done over the last year that were phenomenal 

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Let us all start with the best thing since sliced bread, JUNMYEON OPENING UP HIS INSTAGRAM TO EXO-LS!

On December 4th 2018 he posted his very first picture of the diamond '[Love Shot](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq-IikXhdLL/)' album cover! To announce his debut on instagram he went on [Instagram live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENm-rA1KG3w&amp;feature=youtu.be) where he was in the practice room with some of the other members. It was very very very very very VERY cute and very exo :')

He proceeded to slowly migrate from the EXO-L fansite page over onto Instagram to show us his [fashionista self](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt1Jfk0A8uc/). Matching [with walls](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsLwQQ6BgUI/), whatever catches his [artistic eye](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuTreSWhiff/), even posting a short cover like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrvFgwlBJ0W/) before Christmas. Let's not forget posting selcas with his members for their [birthdays](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwJYoXfBrn5/), supporting them with [whatever schedule they have](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw2GrV2hdlM/), and of course showing his love and support for [EXO](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwPqA6PB1Ks/).

But the CUTEST thing is Junmyeon knowing that we compare him to a little bunny, and making his instagram name [KimJunCotton](https://www.instagram.com/kimjuncotton/). Cotton for a bunny's cotton tail but also cotton meaning myeon in Korean (yes I am crying and you CAN prove it)

&amp;#x200B;

At the time Junmyeon was still performing in the musical 'The Man Who Laughs' as Gwynplaine and had the members coming to support him! If there is one video to watch if you haven't seen any clips of the musical, I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJV3spgBBZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=MYEON8%EC%A4%80%ED%8C%94%EC%9D%B4) one. I was awestruck and floored by this entire video.

He even went to the [Yegreen Musical Awards](https://66.media.tumblr.com/26c63a9fb5d957e221801066e6fdc4b5/tumblr_phuqxzgDGn1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) and won the [Popularity Award](https://twitter.com/BUNNYMYE0N/status/1059472789889933312)! He was very proud and of course, so were we!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's briefly discuss some of my favourite things that Suho has done over the last couple of months; when he attended the MiuMiu Special Event and looked like [this](https://scontent.fymy1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/51794191_2103080366474388_6925460161494515712_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fymy1-2.fna&amp;oh=72cac839de38a353e21d1f41539e0276&amp;oe=5D9BFA97), and did this with [bvlgari](https://www.instagram.com/p/Buqc8rph0Kq/). Took a literal tumble down our hearts while doing finger guns when he went to the [airport](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e666ca9f590b98f1148c100dd0bec4c/tumblr_pj3i59hNOK1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) (exo were [very impressed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236311672325799946/513900945084514307/DsVNiXrUUAAlEyO.png)) and made our dreams come true when he wore [this hat](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1061268086597111808) at the DMUMT fansign.



&amp;#x200B;

I want to mention one more thing before I leave the birthday messages and your favourite things he has done throughout the year in the comments for you all to talk about!

During the DMUMT fansign when an EXO-L told him about this term """", Suho said he saw it but did not know what it meant, so the fan said EXO-Ls gave it the meaning ""the **happiness** that Suho always gives"". Since opening his instagram he has put it in his bio and it has made me very emotionally happy since then.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

So a very happy birthday to the man who works nonstop for himself, his group, his brothers and his family. A leader who works endlessly to make everyone happy and EXO-Ls happier! Leave your well wishes to our leader below and tell me about your favourite things that he has done\~",6,69

Today I wanted to start a series of discussions. I know we all love fancams. *Who doesn't right?!*

I am sure you have more than one favourite from each era, but I wanted to challenge you. 

**What is your favourite fancam from the** [**Monster**](https://img.kpopmap.com/2016/06/exo-monster-perf.jpg) **era? Must only be one.** ***~~I know I'm evil~~***

I think it is no surprise that my favourite fancam is a [Chanyeol focus by my queen SAB: Spunky Action, Baby aka @chanyeolit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFlMECEmjg0) Everything about it makes it my favourite. The colours, the look!!! probably a fave look for Yeol during this era. It also brings back so many good memories from the Monster era and freaking out about everything with my fellow exo-ls.

I can't find much information on twitter and google besides some false voting fraud accusations against EXO LAB, but I don't know if it's relevant.

58,2019-6-10,2019,6,10,11,bysnq2,What are your favourite moments as an EXO-L?,mochismyeon,1560135570,"Congratulations to our r/EXO server for reaching 11,000 members! Were glad we can be a server than can bring you EXO news and keep all of us well informed with their official schedules\~

&amp;#x200B;

As we gained quite a numerous amount of members, I wanted to know what are some of your favourite moments since joining the EXO fandom!

Was it watching a live concert (in person or through your computer) for the first time? Seeing a video of them performing and just being blown away? Was it something one of the members did during a concert or a show? Something sweet they've said during a fanmeet? Start brainstorming!



To name a long and pretty specific memory (one of my FAVOURITE moments) was during the elyxion concerts.   
Lay was a spokesperson for Huawei at the time and they had mistreated him, so to make it short, he ended his contract with them. Chanyeol and Sehun started performing We Young only a handful of times but EXO-Ls noticed their choreography changed when the official news came out. At the beginning of their performance, Chanyeol takes out a Huawei phone as they sit on the couch, and Sehun takes it and [tosses it right out onto ground](https://youtu.be/opGdsOz1Vo8?t=11). I love that even if we cant see the boys directly communicate with each other on social media, we have small moments like these to show that all EXO members got each others backs no matter what!

&amp;#x200B;

Another favourite moment was seeing that Luhan followed Xiumin when he opened up his instagram (ot12 stan now and forever, still crying over this fact).  


And other small moments like Kai being super cute when saying [chicken burrito\~](https://streamable.com/yo0ul) and Baekhyun being extremely cute when performing '[Chill](https://youtu.be/EzqD_TjKFow?t=15)'.  




&amp;#x200B;

So tell me what are your favourite moments\~   
I hope to see many! Don't include just one!",9,20

The mods here all do continue to support the ex-members + keep up with what they do outside of the EXO name now.

That being said, the following note was brought up to us through our census *(thank you to whoever wrote it, this is the type of feedback we want to hear!!)*, and the mods all agree this is a conversation that we need to have with the entire sub:

&gt;*I wish it wasn't OT12? Obviously the ex-members have moved on and don't contribute anything to EXO. Haven't contributed anything in YEARS. They were a part of EXO but not anymore. If they mention EXO in interviews or have interactions on social media and stuff, that would be understandable, but we get updates about their activities which have nothing to do with EXO. It feels like this sub believes that OT9 and ex-members are of equal importance when it comes to EXO's name. That just feels wrong to me who sees how Lay is always apologizing for not being there with the other members, for OT9 who do carry EXO's name on their shoulders. And the ex-members are treated equally in this sub when they do nothing in EXO's name?? Maybe it's just me who has a problem with it? Idk lol I went off, huh?? Sorry but there you go.*

We would be lying if this was something we hadn't been thinking about for a long time, we have noticed the down votes and dwindling comments on anything for the ex-members to the point where even we stopped posting them as much because we thought maybe you guys weren't interested but also didn't want to upset people who like the fact that we are an OT12 fanbase.

Because the census already has over 100 responses, we didn't think it was fair to include a section about making a change in there now, **so we are asking for your feedback below in the comments, or** [**if you would like to fill out this short poll / survey,**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3lrCX0IsLKcBeOwl2jgbuG-iBiZjFWdDMpGwcFCZ1kfSYgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) that would be extremely helpful.

**What do YOU guys want to do?** We have been trying very hard since we took over this sub to make this a better environment for everyone, so we take your feedback very seriously.

*Please keep in mind, we STILL DO NOT tolerate hate or rude comments towards OT12 or Ex-Members. So please, lets have a civil discussion about this!*",65,42

For this week's favourite fancam discussion I picked Call Me Baby as per /u/99101004's [request](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/buwmgu/favourite_fancam_series_monster/epol8r1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)!

**Please post 1 (ONE) fancam! That is your absolute favourite from the CMB era!** 

For me, this is actually quite hard because CMB is such an iconic era... but this [KAI FANCAM](https://youtu.be/TD2snX7YdB8) !!!! 

I never really love M2 fancams but [this outfit](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDKICwdW8AAEgLI.jpg) absolutely killed me and his whole flirtatious attitude :') Definitely one I go back to rewatch.

We hope you are enjoying the beginning of EXO Month and are getting excited for the amazing things to come. Just as things are changing and getting exciting for EXO, we also have some exciting changes below that are pretty important, so we would love if you took some time to read below on the feedback you have given us and the changes we are making. :)

# Changing to OT9 from OT12

If you missed this discussion, then reading this might come as a shock to you. So I will start off by saying that just under a month ago, we started a discussion &amp; poll with the community about changing to an OT9 subreddit from an OT12. [You can read about this all here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bzvu49/rexo_feedback_wanted_changing_to_an_ot9_subreddit/)\~

Firstly, I just want to mention how much the mods appreciate everyone's feedback. We are so over the moon happy we could have a civil discussion about this and take into consideration everyone's different feelings. It was a tough discussion, but we are very glad we decided to have it, we received a lot of very important feedback in our eyes.

Overall, the results were not surprising to us due to the lack of reactions we have been getting over the past few years with former member content. **63.7% of you do not want former member updates to be posted anymore** BUT that being said, of the people who said No, **67.4% of them agree that it would be OK if the mods post a monthly update** master post highlighting what the former members have been doing.

So going forward here is what is going to go down:

* **We will not be posting / allowing NEW former member content to be posted as individual posts outside of a dedicated monthly thread  that we will create or our weekly Casual Convo.** The only exceptions to this rule will be if the former member has interacted with current EXO members in anyway. For example, if Luhan posted about hanging out with Lay or Sehun.
* **We will continue to update former member content in the subreddit's master lists &amp; discography sections.** We will be removing the work they have done post-exo and be placing it into its *OWN section* so you can all still access it and continue to enjoy it!
* **We will not be posting Birthday Banners &amp; Year in Review Discussions for them.** These are a ton of work, and if the general feedback from everyone is that they don't want to see these, than we will stop trying to include them in these activities.
* **We will still allow any old content with them to be posted, or talk of them in comments etc.** We will never remove them completely from this subreddit and we definitely encourage everyone who knows and loves them to continue to talk about them and promote them in comments so new fans can learn about them too!

We hope everyone understands why we have made these decisions and if you wanted to keep the members around on the sub, that you will visit and post in our new monthly update posts. We would love to do bi-weekly as some people suggested, but the mods right now don't have enough time to be making bi-weekly summary posts. If you are interested in being involved in creating these posts, please message Jamie ( u/99101004 ) \~

[If you would like to read the feedback and take a closer look at what people were saying, you can view it all here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3lrCX0IsLKcBeOwl2jgbuG-iBiZjFWdDMpGwcFCZ1kfSYgw/viewanalytics)

# More Laid-Back modding

We received a lot of feedback stating that you wished our modding was more laid-back. We totally understand where you are coming from! We mod in a particular way based on feedback we had received in previous years about what people wanted from this subreddit, which at the time was a News-Based sub.

Your feedback has changed and because of that, we will be taking a step back and trying to promote discussion more rather than sticking to straight up news posts. We will be focusing a lot more on commenting, replying to you all, trying to generate conversations and allowing a lot more types of content on the subreddit - to an extent of course.

* **NSFW Content Reminder**

With that being said, please keep in mind that we do have rules for this subreddit, and we would still like them to be followed. Especially the no NSFW rule. We have noticed lately more extremely suggestive comments about the boys and we would just like to remind you that we do have a younger, not adult audience on this subreddit, regardless if the majority of us may be older.

* **Follow Up &amp; Feedback**

We will do a follow up poll in about 6 months to see if you think things need to change more or are happy with the direction we are going. If you have feedback on things prior to our follow up, please never hesitate to message the mods, we want to hear from you about the ways that we can improve.

If you have more to comment about this now, please tell us in the comments below!!

# Title Guidelines &amp; Flair's

* **General Titles**

The previous mods of this subreddit were extremely strict on title guidelines, and we know that it has scared a lot of you off from posting -- To be honest, it even still makes our current mod team question if we are doing things the right way. Based on this, we have decided that we will NOT be removing things based on what the previous owners considered ""bad titling"". The only exception to this will be when its really really really bad titling *(which it rarely ever is)*!

With that being said, we encourage people to post things even if you are nervous that your title might not be ""up to our standards""! If there is a case where we would have done things a bit differently, we will be leaving comments with suggestions for the future. Please don't take these comments the wrong way, they are meant as reminders and guidance rather than us giving you trouble. We hope that the more we leave encouraging comments like this, the more comfortable people will be with posting in the future! We are here to help\~

* **Discussion / Help Posts**

When it comes to posting Help Or Discussion posts, we just want to remind people overall that a better title for these types of posts is ***what your actual question*** is rather than ""I have a question"". This is just because the majority of people will skip over your post based on that title thinking its a nothing/spam/useless post. So please try to be a bit more specific when it comes to this, we want to see more people participating and answering things! :)

* **Flairs**

Everyone has been doing awesome when it comes to flairs! We really do appreciate it and thank you for putting flairs on your posts. If you are ever confused on what to flair something as, just flair it with ANY flair and we will go in and re-categorize it if need be.

If you are ever REALLY confused and want some guidelines on titles or flairs, we have [some awesome charts that you can reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_title_format) at any point!

# More Discussions

* **Mods to Post More**

We love this idea! We do definitely try to post discussions weekly, if not bi-weekly as we can. The mods here all lead very busy lives too and writing up discussions can sometimes be very time consuming. For the future, we plan on making a schedule to keep us on the ball with this. All we can ask in return is that you try to reply to them and join in on the conversation.

* **What do you want for Discussions?**

We don't always know exactly what you are looking for when you say you would like more discussions, so if you have ideas, please post them yourselves! We feel like a lot of the times, you guys have way better ideas or maybe you want something a lot more basic than the things we come up with *-- maybe you just want to talk about how Red is Chanyeols best hair colour? I mean.. I do?*

* **Discussion Suggestion Form**

If you are too shy / nervous to post discussions yourselves, [we have made a Google Form here where you can submit ideas, or things you have seen other subreddits doing that you would like us to try!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPipuMOY1A1J_Y_iazSWd0iUQyVXZPLMyhk9VTMJRoeVnBQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) The more reasons to talk about EXO, the better!! We don't mind if the discussions have been done before, I will tell you 1000 more times why Love Me Right is EXO's best title track or why Xiumin should be in dance line.

# r/EXO Census Summary

***Now for the fun stuff!!*** A total of 229 people responded to our census this year\~ I think this is one of the more fun census' we have done, I love seeing the differences that everyone has on music taste! What do you all think of the results? Surprised? Figured these would be the answers? We want to hear from you!

If you are interested in a deeper look, [you can click here for the full results of the census](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLZdvaieePEOi4QazjBzjirBfEqIX76wCZr74d_Wdg7K9Ogg/viewanalytics) which features lots of charts!!

We missed out on global package (bummer) but managed to get some pit tickets from Stubhub. There wasn't really any indication of a ticket number on the website and we haven't gotten the tickets shipped to us yet so are the concerts in Korea first come first serve? How early do you have to line up before the concert usually (both for first come first serve and for the number queues)? Finally, how hard is it to push your way to the front in a korea EXO concert (I'm kinda short haha).

So I just got a part time job six months ago and started saving up for exo merchandise. I collected most of the albums and the new light stick. But I love the lighting ver. 2.0 because it's classy and also because it includes lay (ot9 stan). So I ordered the lightstsick for $45 + $15 for shipping from an Instagram seller but guess what I was scammed she was nice and posted regularly but then poof she disappeared well I didn't gave her full payment and only paid her $25. So now i tried Twitter this girl want to meet up in the SMTown store in gangnam to exchange the lightsick and money. Well she seems to be trustworthy cause she agreed for a meetup. But the problem is I live in another country. I have a friend who lives in Seoul but she is out of of station and will come back next month. Can someone who is a true exoL and understand me meet up the girl and check if the lightsick is official and good and give her money which I will be sending you via Pay Pal???? I will be really thankful!!!! Please!!!",12,3

This week we will be looking at the **'Ko Ko Bop'** Era... *I know I suggested we were going to go backwards in order and do Tempo next, but I think it would be more fun if we did random eras instead\~* There are a few things to go over this week, so lets begin!! 

**Last Weeks Results --&gt; Love Shot Era!**

Thank you to those who participated in the vote for who owned the **'Love Shot'** era, our grand winner is **Kai**!! Shockingly, once we narrowed down the results, Kai's percentage actually went DOWN from the [first weeks results](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/ccgpbv/game_time_every_member_owns_an_era_right_who/). Below are your final 3 results:

|MEMBER|RESULT|
|:-|:-|
|**Xiumin**|14.11% (3rd Place)|
|**Baekhyun**|29.7% (2nd Place)|
|**Kai**|56.3% (1st Place)|

&amp;#x200B;

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package. 

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Play this weeks game --&gt; Ko Ko Bop Era!**

Ahhh, dare I say it... but sweet summer time has me longing for EXO in Hawaiian shirts again. Ko Ko Bop era was a long one, so keep in mind all those amazing performances *(yes, technically you could count The Eve under this)* that came months after promotions were over! Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Ko Ko Bop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdssuxDdqKk) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. This is important, especially with such long era's like KKB.  
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday. 
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

I am Xin Yi, and part of my part-time work requires me to check for official SM Reports and around the beginning of July we got one... I know this is late but... Better late than never, I wanted to ask for permission first. I decided that I like to translate these for people on the internet to share after getting permission from our lovely mods...

# However, I have a huge DISCLAIMER first :

While these reports are translated from official sources, that does not mean that the schedules or plans reported in them are SET in stone. That does not mean that I am spreading rumours, all I am here to do is translate what has been reported. I do not create these rumours or reports, I do not have power in what gets green-lit and what does not, I simply translate. That is all. Please do not shoot the messenger.

Often times, reports simply show the projected summaries of what SME would *like* to do with their artists, however the final product/schedules are *fully at the discretion of SME* and more often times than not, there are things that are scrapped  and/or replaced whether it be for financial, personal or undisclosed reasons. As for 'smaller' schedules like fashion show appearances or collaborations with other artists, those are usually not in these reports...

I will only be translating for EXO, I only read EXO's parts because I am a fan, but I do have access to the full reports. If you want to know if there are projected details for any other SME group, please message me personally here \[and I may be able to help you\] or on my other social media if you know me already from other places. You can also ask me any EXO-related questions (or clarification) below :)

# !  EXO SCHEDULE TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

\*\*\*It does not say '**and** repack' it has a '/' so I am not sure if they wanted to release full album earlier or wanted to release them both in the same month...

# AGAIN, HERE IS MY DISCLAIMER:

* I am not claiming to be SM Staff.
* All my sources can be linked to trusted reports, sites and/or news articles. (No ALLKPOP :P)
* I am not translating rumours, I am translating reports from the industry.
* Take this with a grain of salt, just like I do. Just because they are from 'official sources' does not mean that what is in these reports are set in stone.
* Please do not shoot the messenger, or believe these reports with all your heart.

# In regards to the report that was released PRIOR to this report:

Previously in a report **before** July's report released, it had been said that EXO would go on what the report stated would be a 'World/Global Tour.' Whether or not it was meant to be really 'world-wide' wasn't clear, but it seems in this updated proposed future schedule, that they had not included that terminology and replaced it with 'Japan' and 'Southeast asia' tours... We assumed this had changed, but tonight, on Day 3 of EXplOration, Su Ho said something about a 'world tour'... Until the next reports, we might never know the answer. I just thought I would include this part in case any of you had heard about the previous report on a 'world tour' and wonder why there was an inconsistency in this report in relation to the last. Long story short... We really never know what SM is ever planning for sure - Like I've BEEN saying, take this all with large, fat grains of Himalayan pink rock salt. Or chicken salt. Maybe chicken salt, it's always the better option.

&amp;#x200B;

# In regards to JAPANESE tour in MIYAGI:

International fans, please don't spread the whole 'it's dangerous to tour here!!'

Real people actually live in this area over two (2) million to be exact!! It is NOT dangerous that is FALSE. It's really not great to read things on Twitter without researching them and then help trend a false hashtag. It is **NOT DANGEROUS TO BE THERE**. According to radiation dosage charts, it is safe to be in Miyagi, these charts are official and Government approved. Please RESEARCH before finding another reason to blame SM just for the sake of it...

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you :)

This week we will be looking at the **'Lotto'** Era! Lets start with last weeks results\~

[**Last Weeks Results --&gt; Ko Ko Bop Era!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cfg6tq/game_time_which_member_owned_the_ko_ko_bop_era/)

Thank you to those who participated in the vote for who owned the **'Ko Ko Bop'** era, our grand winner is **Xiumin**! Below are your final 3 results:

|MEMBER (Age Order)|RESULTS|
|:-|:-|
|**Xiumin**|49.1% - 1^(st) Place|
|**Chen**|29.8% - 2^(nd) Place|
|**Chanyeol**|21.1% - 3^(rd) Place|

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

**Play this weeks game --&gt; Lotto Era!**

Lotto won the vote by 51.8%! You all have a clear mind set and I am interested to see who your pick is for Lotto\~ Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Lotto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbe3pe2BtwA) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. This is important especially if your vote is for Kai, as he had to sit out of music shows &amp; the dance in the MV as he was injured\~
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

[**Round 1 Winners**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/ch10q8/game_time_which_member_owned_the_lotto_era_round_1/)

Backstory- I used to have very limited internet access and so saved my favorite fics so I could read them without using up my library time. I just found a folder of them on an old thumb drive, but there was a problem.......part 2 of 180 degrees isn't there, only part 1 and part 3.

The title is....
UN VILLAGE !

its so short but can u blame me? i did it in one day. and my head is pounding. but anyways, id love for ppl to take a few minutes to play this dumbass game that is completely useless !! yay! 

Ill be making a lot more EXO games in the future!!! Theyll be bad tho cause I have to pay money to get cool features lol 

tips:
- arrows to move, arrow + shift to sprint, space to interact, X to open menu
- check for interactive objects such as signs and docks (there arent much)
- try for different dialogue (again, there isnt much but i didnt spend all that time for nothing)
- check food on table once inside abode(ull see it)
- to exit chanbaek abode, interact w village thingy in bottom right corner


thats it. btw, just because its an exe file does not mean im tryna hack ur computer or something kskssksksks the game probably takes like 5 minutes or something to play lol PLEASE play it

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

**Play this weeks game --&gt; Growl Era**

Growl won this weeks vote by 43.2% since 43% of you don't want to have fun and do something like Wolf or Mama, haha!!! Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Growl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

A few notes beside our typical rules, I used the Gifs from the [2nd Growl video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUs-hBjU9w8) as most of the gifs from the 1st MV include a ton of flashing lights and I don't want that to be triggering for people who are sensitive to that. Also, I dislike that I feel that I have to say this but.... Please DON'T ***NOT*** pick a former member just because they are a former member of EXO. Growl is a massive era that these members were part of, and we should also celebrate the time that they were there, if you were around than and you think a former member owned the era, vote for them or post videos and things below to prove your point! If you weren't around and you don't know about the former members, be sure to take the time to notice them in these performances as they were just as fantastic as our current members.

Theres really no way I see this working, but I feel so bad for our EXO boys and pretty much everyone involved since they probably worked their asses off only for their own fans to be boycotting their hard work on twitter. I want to support this only because I love SHINee, EXO and NCT and they deserve better, but itll be hard since it seems unlikely that SM is going to succeed on this venture, everything from the name to the slogan and timing is so poorly strategized and Im sure Taemin and Baekhyun especially, whove worked really hard on their solo releases this year, are exhausted already. 

These are my thoughts",2,1

For title tracks, I really like Love Shot (partly just because of how attractive all the members are in all the perfs etc) and Overdose + Call Me Baby. I can't even choose anymore because they're all so good haha.

**About This Game**

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

[**Round 1 Winners**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cna0um/game_time_which_member_owned_the_growl_era_round_1/)

Lets have some fun with this one. This is a hilarious era, so lets find out who it will be\~ Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled [Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAal8xHfV0c) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era.
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, its all just for fun.

A few notes beside our typical rules... Please DON'T ***NOT*** pick a former member just because they are a former member of EXO. [Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAal8xHfV0c) was a massive era that these members were part of, and we should also celebrate the time that they were there, if you were around than and you think a former member owned the era, vote for them or post videos and things below to prove your point! If you weren't around and you don't know about the former members, be sure to take the time to notice them in these performances as they were just as fantastic as our current members.

I am back with yet another report translation. The latest report came out yesterday according to  and I believe it covers the period from the 1st of January to the 30th of July.

There is nothing revolutionary or shocking in this report but I will roughly translate bits EXO is mentioned in/that affects EXO anyway, just for fun. It is a little boring for most fans I think but if you are a business/market/contract nerd this might be for you...

However, as per usual, I have a huge DISCLAIMER first :

I am not ""spreading rumours,"" all I am here to do is translate what has been reported. I do not audit or create the reports, I do not have power in what gets green-lit and what does not in SM, I simply translate what I read. That is all. Don't shoot the messenger please...

I will only be translating for EXO, I only read EXO's parts because I am a fan, but I do have the full reports. If you want to know if there are projected details for any other SME group, please message me personally here \[and I may be able to help you\] or on my other social media if you know me already from other places. You can also ask me any EXO-related questions (or clarification) below :)

# ! TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

&amp;#x200B;

General summary of EXO as an artist under SME:

&gt;""... Our artists... \[including\] EXO have aided in raising lots of interest in Korean culture worldwide and helping to create a 'ripple effect' in several fields.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;... In April of 2012, the 12-member boy group 'EXO' debuted in Korea and China and became the next generation global star, expanding K-Pop's global market and creating added value to the economy \[export diversification\].

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 2013 \[SM artists\] also broke/created(?) several records in the music industry. EXO's 1st \[full\] Album 'XOXO' (1st full/regular album released June 3rd and 1st repackaged album August 5th) sold ONE MILLION physical copies only six months after its release \[December 27th, 2013\]. This made EXO the first group, and 'XOXO' the first album, to hit one million physical sales in 12 whole years \[since 2001\~\].  
&gt;  
&gt;\[This is why industry professionals and media say that EXO broke a 12 year physical drought/a 'dying industry' a.k.a physical sales.\]

&amp;#x200B;

# 2018 () ( 100 ) - 2018 Music/Recording Industry Market Share Holders (Top 100)

&gt;SMENT is the no. 1 market shareholder, with over 5 million in sales rates/volumes(?). They hold/own the highest /percentage of the market with 24.27% of the shares.

[\*Above chart is based on the TOP 100 monthly data.](https://i.redd.it/wyglvp61ojg31.png)

# 1)    - [Active] Major Contracts

   ,      - Artist Management, contract status.

[\^ All EXO 9 current 'EXO' members still under contract with SME.](https://i.redd.it/nz3bdcu7sjg31.png)

Also for people who are still unaware/wonder... Yes, as you can see, all three former members are to pay SM part of their incomes until 2022, I believe, and there are Japan and Korea promoting restrictions...

[... Meaning they're still under contract, as you can  see here.](https://i.redd.it/u6ozpieksjg31.png)

# 2)     - Overseas Licensing Agreements

In regards to the report that was released PRIOR to this report:

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

I know I posted a translation yesterday but we've been hit with a bomb of eight different reports just this afternoon :') So... I'm back again. These reports cover:

\- EXO's impact on SM's second half of this year and,

\- EXO's predicted (positive) impacts on SM's falling profits following certain activities....

So read on below to find out what.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# ! TRANSLATIONS BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

&amp;#x200B;

SM's profits haven't been up to standard/prediction allegedly, however SM believes that due to EXO's upcoming comeback and EXO's current/recent actities (A.K.A Baek Hyun, Se Chan), album profitability will recover in this year's second-half (herein referred to as simply '2H') earnings projections/expectations.

&gt;""EXO's album sales \[alone\] can defend earnings.""

According to the industry researcher, **excluding** Byun Baek Hyun's solo and EXO-SC 2H sales (combined sales of 850,000 albums in July alone), EXO's regular album in the fourth quarter ('4Q') alone is expected to bring in 4.46 \[4,460,000\] million sales, which is 92% of 2018's annual sales (, 2019)

Dreammaker is expected to hold concerts for over 10,000 people, which includes EXO's concerts (and two other artists), and concerts held in Japan is expected to reflect about 1.1M concert goers in total including EXO's concerts alongside TVXQ's. The upcoming EXplOration concerts are expected to be 'large-scale' operations.

As mentioned prior, EXO's ""selling power"" (combined with SUJU's) is expected to be enough for SM to **not** have to reduce their projected profit projections. In fact, do to the full comeback of EXO in 2H combined with EXO's 'large scale' JAPAN and Dreammaker concerts, projected profits are expected to be 10 billion won (8,270,000USD/12,197,009.50AUD).

There will be an expected 'performance gap' from EXO in 4Q due to the start of military era/recruitment that all boy groups eventually face. EXO's performance contribution next year will also be small \[... as there are rumours of 2-4 EXO members applying simultaneously by the end of 2019/early 2020\]. This is worrying for SM as there is no current rookie boy group to fill the gap and SM's main boy groups are currently showing signs of struggle(?)

Industry professionals say that it will be impossible\[/unlikeable\] for the project group SuperM to fill the gap with new members once EXO's and SHINee's member begin to enlist.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and ***GO BACK to old performances*** (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember ***who stood out to you the most***. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Round 1 Winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cq3xwv/game_time_which_member_owned_the_wolf_era_round_1/)

&amp;#x200B;

# ! TRANSLATION BELOW !

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

[EXO's sales are in RED](https://i.redd.it/w9hz6pzaaih31.png)

***\['2Q' means 2nd Quarter - I believe 2Q is usually 1st of the 4th month \~ 30th of the sixth month\]***

2Q'15 - EXO = just under 800,000 pieces.

2Q'16 - EXO = just under 800,000 pieces, and a little more than 2Q'15.

2Q'17 - EXO = under 200,000 pieces.

2Q'18 - EXO = just under 400,000 pieces.

2Q'19 - EXO = around 200,000 pieces.

**2019, 7th month = just under 1M pieces.**

MY DISCLAIMER:

* I am not claiming to be an SM Staff!!!!!! All my sources are just from trusted reports/reporters/analysts, sites, databases and/or news articles from Naver (No ALLKPOP :P).
* I am not translating rumours, I am translating reports.
* Please do not shoot the messenger.
* \[Things in brackets\] - Added by myself to make sentences make a little more sense and/or to give context OR explanations by me.

In regards to the report that was released PRIOR to this report:

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

In another report I translated and uploaded, it explained the record/music contracts that EXO (+ lawsuit-line) are under with SM &amp; subsidiaries/partners. You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_semiannual\_report/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_semiannual_report/)

In the previous report, it explained EXO's expectations &amp; impact on SM's income and sales as a huge ""selling power."" You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_industry/)

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# Play this week's game --&gt; Call Me Baby Era

I honestly don't believe this is a bad era for ANY member, so this is going to be a wild game. Below is a reminder of the rules:

Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled[ Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfsla_Uh80) era!

// If you have the time or want to it answer it would be really appreciated! Its okay to only answer the ones youre certain of like you dont have to answer all if you dont want to/cant! 

1. What are versions of exo-ls name (nicknames etc.) and where do they originate from because I see like erigom and phixo and I think they mean exo-ls but Im not really certain? 

2. (TW, idk if anyone is sensitive abt this?) Does anyone know the dates the members are coming back from military service or is it not certain? I hate myself for not stanning earlier I- 

3. Whats the best performance(s) exo has done I need to see? 

4. Are there any particular and active, not cringey, inside jokes yall have? 

5. Any special/fun things I should know about each member that isnt really well known already? Or any like trademark things any member have? 

6. Does the members have their own emoji?* *For example when translators write the dialouge theres often an emoji for each member of a group so op doesnt have to type their names all the time. 

7. What are the members majors? 

8. Ive seen some theories about their storyline, is the story still developing or did it end a while ago? Also, does anyone really know what happened or is it all theories right now?

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Last Weeks Results --&gt; Call Me Baby Era\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cuo8ru/game_time_which_member_owned_the_call_me_baby_era/)

Thank you to those who participated in the vote for who owned the **'Call Me Baby'** era! Below are your final 3 results:

|:-|:-|:-|
|D.O.|1st Place|62.6%|
|Lay|2nd Place|23.7%|

# Play this week's game --&gt; Power Era

Two killer era's back-to-back! I honestly think Power was one of their best era's, everyone looked amazing, sounded good and just had SO much fun. Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the [Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRv8ZBLuW0) era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!! 
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

We would love for our community to feel involved in the decisions we make so........

**If you are a graphic designer, artist or just like to put pictures together** and want to take a stab at making a banner for the subreddit, than this challenge is for you! We will be leaving the submissions open for just over 2 weeks and than we will be posting them all up for a vote on which banner the subbies like best\~

**If you aren't any of these things or don't have time to participate this round,** but have ideas or examples of exo (or non-exo) designs and things you like, comment below so people who are participating know what others like! You can help guide us and give us inspiration\~ 

# Guidelines:

* **Must be group focused:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall. It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together). 
* **Must be the following size:** 1920px x 192px in .jpg or .png format
* **Submit to:** [rexomods@gmail.com](mailto:rexomods@gmail.com) by Sunday, September 15th at 11:59pm

I am new to the fandom and am just starting to gather subbed videos. The master lists this sub has created are beautiful! As I continue to learn how to navigate through resources, I'm having a difficult time finding where EXO has been featured on Japanese programs. 

I'm looking for the show titles/(full) videos/subs of the Japanese shows EXO has appeared on. A few clip examples come to mind: Baekhyun dancing to PPAP, D.O acting out ""have you eaten yet?"", Kai's shimo shimo gag with comedian Hirano Nora, CBX promotions, drama interviews, etc.

(I'm old, I don't remember exact dates LOL) EXO has brought a lot of joy into my life. I hear their music and want to dance and I don't care if anyone is watching. I hear their ballads and want to sing at the top of my lungs... poorly. My daughter (15yo) also loves EXO and they are something we can bond over. She heard me playing them one day and then I showed her an MV and it was all over. She fell in love! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working out more and I love being able to hop on the tread mill and run to the beat of Monster or Overdose and lift weights to Power. Yeah, that last bit is silly but I don't care, I love it and it works for me. I love collecting their albums and having them displayed on my wall (protected in plastic for sure). I also have the Photo Cards (also protected) on display. because, how can you not? 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that is hard though, is realizing that the general fanbase is much younger than me. That was a rough one for me to get over. I looked and looked to find people out of their 20's who also liked EXO just like me, and it has been tough. Not that I dont want to talk to the younger EXO fans, I love them too, they are the bulk of what keeps EXO going. But I wanted to know that I was legit, not the only person over the age of 30 that thought EXO was just AMAZING. When I tell people I love EXO or K-Pop in general I get the ""aren't you a little old for that"" look.... And I don't care anymore! I like what I like!

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me your stories!!! Tell me what it has been like for you as an older EXO-L. Who is your Bias? What is your favorite Song/Album? What kinds of joy has EXO brought to your life? I would love to chat with every one of you! OLDER EXO-Ls ARE AMAZING TOO!!",84,38

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

I also want to get some inspiration as well!And for others to share and get inspiration too!

# r/EXO's [Sub Banner Design Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cwoyit/rexos_sub_banner_design_challenge/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

We are looking for a new design for the Fall [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO/) Sub Banner and have decided it would be fun to see what types of banners you would like to see on the subreddit. We would love for our community to feel involved in the decisions we make so...

**If you are a graphic designer, artist or just like to put pictures together** and want to take a stab at making a banner for the subreddit, than this challenge is for you! We will be leaving the submissions open for just over 2 weeks and than we will be posting them all up for a vote on which banner the subbies like best\~

**If you aren't any of these things or don't have time to participate this round,** but have ideas or examples of exo (or non-exo) designs and things you like, comment below so people who are participating know what others like! You can help guide us and give us inspiration\~

Guidelines:

* **Must be Group focused or Type-based:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall.
   * Photos: It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together).
   * We will also accept [EXO logo](https://i.imgur.com/YMI44zs.jpg) or Lyric based banners that are more designed with only type - You can do this as long as it does not include ANY photos of the members. For example, Don't do a lyric based banner and ONLY show a photo of D.O. - If it includes photos, it must contain all the members. Here is [Another example](https://i.imgur.com/taoOxdX.jpg).
* **Must be the following size:** 1920px x 192px in .jpg or .png format
* **Submit to:** [rexomods@gmail.com](mailto:rexomods@gmail.com) by Sunday, September 15th at 11:59pm

**Examples of past banners:**

* [2015-2017 Subreddit Headers](https://imgur.com/a/bpLPD)
* [2018-2019 Subreddit Headers](https://imgur.com/a/Ix6RVgR)

HI! My name is Vickie (Blazingkrystal). I have been a fan of EXO for about 2 years now and my bias is Xiumin. I am currently building my album collection, so if you have any suggestions of your favorite album versions, I would love to hear them.  I am enjoying learning  all the things about EXO I missed out on before becoming a fan. That being said, I am in charge of getting all of our Master Lists whipped into shape, so visit them often!!! Let us know if any links are broken or missing so we can make the Master Lists the one stop hub for all your visual EXO needs!!! I look forward to talking with all of you and helping out any other way I can!!!

**Before we start:** I want to bring up that I have noticed in the time stamps some fishy looking voting for particular group members and it has happened the past few rounds in particular. ***Please remember that currently we are trusting that you are only voting ONCE.*** I would hate to have to change these polls to you guys having to sign to ensure you are only voting ONCE.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and **GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!)** from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. ***Leave your bias' behind*** (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Last Weeks Results: Monster Era](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/d0pgcs/game_time_which_member_owned_the_monster_era/)

Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the Tempo era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!!
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

We would love for our community to feel involved in the decisions we make so........

**If you are a graphic designer, artist or just like to put pictures together** and want to take a stab at making a banner for the subreddit, than this challenge is for you! We will be leaving the submissions open for just over 2 weeks and than we will be posting them all up for a vote on which banner the subbies like best\~

**If you aren't any of these things or don't have time to participate this round,** but have ideas or examples of exo (or non-exo) designs and things you like, comment below so people who are participating know what others like! You can help guide us and give us inspiration\~

Guidelines:

* **Must be Group focused or Type-based:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall.
   * Photos: It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together).
   * We will also accept [EXO logo](https://i.imgur.com/YMI44zs.jpg) or Lyric based banners that are more designed with only type - You can do this as long as it does not include ANY photos of the members. For example, Don't do a lyric based banner and ONLY show a photo of D.O. - If it includes photos, it must contain all the members. Here is [Another example](https://i.imgur.com/taoOxdX.jpg).
* **Must be the following size:** 1920px x 192px in .jpg or .png format
* **Submit to:** [rexomods@gmail.com](mailto:rexomods@gmail.com) by Sunday, September 15th at 11:59pm

**Examples of past banners:**

* [2015-2017 Subreddit Headers](https://imgur.com/a/bpLPD)

# Voting Time!

For those who didn't participate, its now time for you to vote for which one you like the best\~ Voting will be closed on Saturday, September 21. Below you will find a link to vote as well as the guidelines that were given for the challenge:

&gt;**Must be Group focused or Type-based:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall.  
&gt;  
&gt;Photos: It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together).  
&gt;  
&gt;We will also accept [EXO logo](https://i.imgur.com/YMI44zs.jpg) or Lyric based banners that are more designed with only type - You can do this as long as it does not include ANY photos of the members. For example, Don't do a lyric based banner and ONLY show a photo of D.O. - If it includes photos, it must contain all the members. Here is [Another example](https://i.imgur.com/taoOxdX.jpg).

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and **GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!)** from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. ***Leave your bias' behind*** (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Last Week's Results: Tempo Era](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/d40318/game_time_which_member_owned_the_tempo_era_round_2/)

We had a record amount of votes this round! Wow! 

|Member|Rank|Percentage Results|

|Chanyeol|1^(st) Place|32.8%|
|D.O.|2^(nd) Place|31.3%|
|Kai|3^(rd) Place|22.1%|
|Suho|4^(th) Place|13.7%|

# Previous Era Winners:

|**Power**|Suho|43.5%|
|**Monster**|Baekhyun|67.7%|
|**Tempo**|Chanyeol|32.8%|

# Play This Week: MAMA Era

Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the MAMA era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!!
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

***Disclaimer:*** We will now be collecting reddit usernames for every vote to try to help combat people cheating and voting multiple times. If we notice it is still happening after this round, we will be requiring sign-in going forward!

I'd also really like to spend time with Kai because then we'd get to play with his niece and nephew!!

And then lastly... Baekhyun because I really just want to play with Mongryong and maybe we can throw in some video games too\~ (Sounds like the best day ever to me)

As per usual, let's go over some of the great thing our vocal king has done since his last birthday\~

His first album, 'April, And A Flower' sold 185,489 copies in its first month and has over 200k to date! To promote his first ever solo album album, he went on the street and did some busking (and was totally surprised by the number of people that went to see him. Chen, how are you surprised in any way!?   
Some of Chens 1st mini album 'April, and a flower' proceeds were donated to [SM and UNICEF](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b8jpul/some_of_chens_1st_mini_album_april_and_a_flower/) ""Smile For U"" [campaign as well](https://em.wattpad.com/e96a2577c0c3de98aadaa15b07413cdfe9f6717e/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f38435751736550685f54567953513d3d2d3235302e313538653438623461306538623036343435373439373631353336312e676966?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720)\~ 

All the videos he posted as we were waiting for his album. His own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5vXjgHeenPq0lTSokouxdA) where he posts covers and his way to interact directly with fans. This collaboration with [Onestar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycTW2hJ87E) which is all kinds of BRILLIANT.  
He even sang '[Cherry Blossom Love Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRKjr8H_jxg)' which was an OST for D.O.'s show '100 Days My Husband' and nothing could sound sweeter /swoon/.   


He MC'ed for Xiumin's fanmeet, and for Baekhyun's debut showcase. ~~Xiumin also MC'ed for Chen's debut showcase~~ ([EXO-CBX RISE FOREVER](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c602cf721262a7850050cf5a9f601e8/tumblr_p6wudtFMkq1x4d0b6o1_500.gif)) 

Chen sponsored a food truck to support those who are about to take the college entrance test ( / korean sat). [The banner reads](https://twitter.com/sberryeol/status/1062301245510164480) ""3rd years (high school) fighting, let's eat spicy grilled chicken and ace the sat"".

I have only gotten into exo since the last month . And my fav is kai- his personality and stage persona is incredible. His looks have always intrigued maybe because i am biased to him but still. His features are so unique especially his full lips which is mostly a feminine trait , but he works it. And also his skin tone. There are times when he spots a soft look making him slightly a pretty boy but there are times he couldnt look less manly( confession superm teaser) especially with his hair slicked back. There is something about his looks which i cant pinpoint.I would like to hear your opinions.",28,4

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

* Suho - If random people show up on the island to rescue you, you definitely need someone to communicate with them properly so he's the man for the job. Being stuck on a deserted island, you need some dad jokes don't you?

Next week we will be starting something new\~ Probably something not member competitive since it seems some people can't not just vote for their bias  

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# 'Overdose' Round One Ranks

We did things differently this time around since back in the OVERDOSE days, things were much more split. The top 2 from each sub-group will move on to the next round\~

**EXO-K**

|Member|Ranking|Results|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Kai**|**1st Place**|**37%**|
|**Baekhyun**|**2nd Place**|**17.4%**|
|D.O.|3rd Place|15.2%|
|Chanyeol|4th Place|13%|
|Suho|5th Place|10.9%|
|Sehun|6th Place|6.5%|

**EXO-M**

|Member|Ranking|Results|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Xiumin**|**1st Place**|**34.8%**|
|**Luhan**|**2nd Place**|**19.6%**|
|Kris|3rd Place (2-Way Tie)|13%|
|Lay|3rd Place (2-Way Tie)|13%|
|Tao|4th Place|10.9%|
|Chen|5th Place|8.7%|

# Play Round 2

Below is a reminder of the rules:

Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the Overdose era!

* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!!
* **On Tuesday evening (EST),** I will post the winner of this round, as well as what our new game will be!
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

***Disclaimer:*** We will now be collecting reddit usernames for every vote to try to help combat people cheating and voting multiple times. If we notice it is still happening after this round, we will be requiring sign-in going forward!

KAI _ door

.
Choreographed by yours truly @mihawkback
Performed by my big boy @zkdlin
.
This performance is very meaningful to both me and Kai. We had very limited time to create this piece while we were on tour and the situation was pretty bad. However, as you guys watch this, we did it again. Its already over a decade since I trained Kai for the first time when he was only 15. Weve been created so many performance together for the past years like deep breath and I see you etc. but this one..means quite a lot to me.
Ive been suffering from creating new things for the artists as time goes by and recently, it just ended up to the peak and I felt so pressured by no one but myself.
This performance door is named by me. I want myself and Kai to get over the past and move further together. I want us to break the limit that we are facing now. I hope this performance would lead us to the new world. I just want to open the door and move on.
Thank you for watching.
.
And Thanks to everyone who helped us for this one.

This is THE door, and its open.",2,6

&gt;DISCLAIMER :  
&gt;  
&gt;While these reports are official sources, that does not mean that the schedules or plans reported in them are SET in stone. I am not ""spreading rumours,"" all I am here to do is translate what has been reported. I do not audit or create the reports, I do not have power in what gets green-lit and what does not in SM, I simply translate what I read. Don't shoot the messenger...  
&gt;  
&gt;Often times, reports simply show the projected summaries of what SME would *like* to do with their artists \[from what I've observed over the years\], however the final product/schedules are *fully at the discretion of SME* and there are many, many things that are scrapped and/or replaced whether it be for financial, personal or undisclosed reasons. As for 'smaller' schedules like fashion show appearances or collaborations with other artists, those are usually not in these reports...  
&gt;  
&gt;I will only be translating for EXO, I only read EXO's parts because I am a fan, but I do have the full reports. If you want to know if there are projected details for any other SME group, please message me personally here \[and I may be able to help you\] or on my other social media if you know me already from other places.

 (2012 . 10) - EXO (2012 Debut. 10-Year \[contract\]).

[3Q Previews &amp; Expectations :](https://i.redd.it/2nxlrkn3bvp31.png)

SME album sales have increased drastically thanks to the efforts of *EXO BAEK HYUN* \[who sold 550,000 units as of August 2019\] *+ CHAN YEOL &amp; SE HUN* \[who sold 410,000 unites as of August 2019\]. Of the 1.4M/1.5M \[the reports say these two numbers, presumably because it is in between\] total SME sales in 3Q \[minus Sept.\], EXO members, without a full group comeback, make up 960,000 units by themselves.

SM are expected to hit and surpass 2M units thanks to EXO's upcoming group and solo \[CHEN\] comebacks.

To put EXO's selling power into perspective, the reports named three other SME artists who are collectively expected to sell around 3M additional albums with their upcoming comebacks, while EXO are expected to help reach 2M alone.

EXO's most recent concerts have brought in 90,000 of 150,000 concert goers between the two mentioned artists.

&amp;#x200B;

[4Q Growth Expectations + U.S. Expansion :](https://i.redd.it/0omqunrdcvp31.png)

U.S. expansion is estimated to aid in the overall operating profit of 18.4 billion KRW \[+21% from 3Q\]. U.S. expansion is focused around Marvel collaborations \[you will have already seen previous Marvel collabs for EXO-CBX, they are now trying this in mainstream America instead of just Japan goods\] and SUEM group actives \[KAI/BAEK\].

EXO along with another group are expected to bring in 500,000 people with their Japanese tour combined.

CHEN comes back TODAY, 6pm KST.

SUEM debuts in Hollywood on October 4th.

* I am not claiming to be an SM Staff!!!!!! All my sources are just from trusted reports/reporters/analysts, sites, databases and/or news articles from Naver. (No ALLKPOP :P)
* I am not translating rumours, I am translating reports.
* Take this with a grain of salt, just like I do.
* Please do not shoot the messenger, or believe these reports with all your heart. Even the reports themselves sometimes say 'perhaps'/'maybe' this will happen lol...

In regards to the reports previously released :

Previously in a report **before** this report released, an 'expected'/'proposed' schedule for EXO and other artists was released. Clearly with the new SUPERM group, a lot of things have been pushed back and changed (SM **said** that it wouldn't affect the original groups but it was clear that was an ambitious statement from the beginning, it will affect all groups involved), and with multiple EXO members needing/wanting to enlist by the end of the year/early next year, this is also a hurdle for EXO. But if you'd still like to read the report, it's translated by me here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo\_proposed\_q2\_schedule\_translation\_of\_offical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cgbvxb/exo_proposed_q2_schedule_translation_of_offical/)

In another report I translated and uploaded, it explained the record/music contracts that EXO (+ lawsuit-line) are under with SM &amp; subsidiaries/partners. You can find that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_semiannual\_report/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cqm4q6/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_semiannual_report/)

In the previous report, it explained EXO's expectations &amp; impact on SM's income and sales as a huge ""selling power."" You can find those here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo\_translation\_of\_offical\_sme\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cr4285/exo_translation_of_offical_sme_industry/)

# New Series: Song Showdown

I really wanted to do EXO Members best hair colour/style next, but as I worked away on it tonight I realized it will take me over a month to collect all the photos needed to run that game. So, while I work away on that lets do some quick games of Song Showdown\~ 

# How to Play

1. Take some time to think about your ***LEAST favourite*** ***songs*** from each of the EXO-CBX albums. 
2. Go vote for which songs should be voted out of the first round! 
3. Come back from Friday - Tuesday to vote for your favourite tracks that made it through the cut!

Please only vote once, this is just a game, it is all for fun, there are no true answers here.

Our Lay has accomplished so much since his last birthday so lets commemorate him on another hard working year!



He released NAMANANA and it debuted #21 on Billboard 200, #1 on World Albums Chart and #1 on Independant Albums Chart. The digital album had a sale of 1.006 million copies sold on Chinese platforms. He hashtagged #[NAMANANAChallenge](https://twitter.com/layzhang/status/1056055713301217280?s=20) and we have not stopped seeing t-rex's since. He gave me my favourite interview to date, [thank you BuzzFeed and his cat, Cat](https://youtu.be/jujiQQU_9Rs?t=67). 

Lay gave us this soft Christmas song '[When It's Christmas](https://open.spotify.com/track/2bimU81DVIiZDvgjWtD27m?si=uwsa2PVLTSGPln14oFIslQ)'. With the help of Alan Walker, he released '[Sheep Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kthhAjR4CBs)' and with his new bro Jason Derulo, he featured in his song '[Let's Shut Up &amp; Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBWgqb3KIeA)' (with NCT 127!). Last collaboration he had was with Far East Movement and their song '[LoveBird](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Fjp9RR9mwtQHKACnqew5o?si=kOk7KkZjT4KAmwQAqunImA)'!

He attended the [61st Grammy Awards](https://twitter.com/layzhang/status/1094705662100029440) as FM Donggan 101's ambassador and the only official Chinese organization invitee and [finally ate that hot dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btu0RVdnI_j/) he had been dreaming about. Seriously, [he's obsessed](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Kve5iAsJF/). 

Lay released a mini called '[Honey](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btu0RVdnI_j/)' and opened up his own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCROoY31pgrU66oSzkYdWWmw/featured)! 'Honey' set a new records on QQ Music! 3 minutes &amp; 27 seconds to reachHall Golden Recordstatus, breaking his own previous record reaching best selling album of 2019! It was the 'Golden Song of the Year' at the 2019 Global Chinese Music Awards. 

Actor!Xing made an appearance in the show 'Golden Eyes' (which had about a million episodes) and won the Best Full-Length TV Drama award in Seoul International Drama Awards.

New year, new advertisements! This year he partnered up with Pizza Hut China ('Pizza Air' has sold 4.9 million pizzas in 4 weeks), Wong Lo Kat Herbal Tea, Perrier Mineral Water, H&amp;M, Calvin Klein Jeans and Underwear, Daniel Wellington and just recently because the official spokesperson of MAC for all of Asia Pacific.

Last but not least he finally held his first solo concert 'Grand Line'\~ The concert in Chongqing stop ticket pre-sale was sold out within 3 minutes and 26 seconds.



Happy birthday Xingie, wishing you health and happiness as always.

So i always thought it was the exo-m members that were more popular in china than the exo-k members. Like xiumin, chen and obviously the chinese members. But to my surprise sehun is the most popular member after the chinese members. How did he get that popularity? Have he acted in any chinese movies or dramas or anything related to chinese. He have also won popularity award.Or is it fully because of his looks?? Which confuses me because, in the youtube channel called asian boss, one woman have told that pretty boy looks are mostly popular in china. So i can understand luhan being very popular there.

I often try to think about what I would ever say to any of the EXO members if I ever had the opportunity to speak to them. They have impacted my life in so many ways and brought me so much strength and happiness I just always wish there were the right words to tell them. I could never repay them back for the years of happiness they have given me but sometimes I think writing these little reminders help me remember why they are so important to me, and why I am a fan.  

I think I just really would like to tell them thank you for everything they have done and been through in order to bring happiness into our lives. Because of them, I have met my best friends, smiled on days where I normally wouldn't have, and continued down my dream career paths because they encourage us to do so.

229,2019-10-26,2019,10,26,3,dn1tec,Various thoughts on Exo,ianna11,1572029029,"I would just like to share my thoughts on many things surrounding exo

1. Now that I have digged deeper, I am sad SM did not let exo reach its full potential, I'm not saying they would have been like BTS, but they could have been bigger, outside asia, they are not much recognized. They were still very popular when SM slowed down in promoting them. SM should have focused hyping them up, more music, varieties and shows.

Proof that exo is very is that it is still the second top group even members in the past 2-3 years were busy on solo activities, or not busy at all.

2. I didnt like exo being nominated in the AMAs. It was obviously for clout and fanwars, for the drama. Also MAMA should have spared exo, we all know bts is bagging everything, so no hype from exo-ls.

3. Which brings me to another point, I feel like exo-ls are getting few and not very active nowadays, the fire burning is not there anymore. We do not engage us much, I'm not very sure about this.

4. XiuSoo's military affected exo's popularity. 

5. Fans have to admit Kyungsoo enlisted for AWTG. It was the best choice for his career as SM was really sloppy.

6. I feel that this comeback will be the last before their hiatus.

7. And exo (except solo chen)  is not attending the SBS Gayo (not confirmed yet) but the reasons could be, either the closing act is for bts, so it would be awkward for the two groups. But I believe the reason could be the date (Dec 28) is very near suho's enlistment.


Tldr
SM wasted exo's potential
AMA should have not nominated exo
Exo is getting less popular
Ksoo enlisted because SM has no clear goals for exo anymore
This will be the last cb before hiatus
Exo will not attend SBS Gayo",2,1

This is weird, it sounds weird"" I was just so thrown off by the fact that they were singing about El Dorado (which, in my childhood, I watched a movie about going to El Dorado like a billion times so that's the only thing I was picturing in my head at the time). But then I saw performances of it and they were stunning, they were awesome, they were so magical that I was like ""Okay this song is awesome I suck"" Hahahaha. Baek's high note definitely had something to do with it but I loved them singing with the lights in the ground and their outfits were so cool, I love the performance of it soooo much!!

A song I didn't know about until I started watching concerts was Drop That. I hadn't known about this song until my friend started sending me clips of the Japanese concerts and I was like ""Woah, what is that, that sounds hype af"" And then we watched the whole concert and I was floored, it was soooo cool. I got into my car and turned up the bass and paaaaarty!

0,2019-11-1,2019,11,1,11,dpy3p8,how will exo's future look like &amp; to all D.O stans: acting or exo or a solo album or all of that?,boxqlilac,1572574848,"exo:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it's likely that exo will go the path similar to SUJU stick together as best as possible? Or do you think someone will leave like it happened to SNSD/Infinite/B1A4 etc to pursue acting or a solo career/just leave sm.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask this question because for me as D.O stan I think his choices depend on exo's path and exo's future .. TL;DR: I don't know if I even want them to continue releasing albums/touring year after year.. They've been doing this for years.. I want the boys to rest and do what they couldn't do due to their busy idol lifestyle... I mean i am excited to see new content soon, I guess they should make the best of it as long as the contract is going..? \*no offense\*..Also it depends on how their songs will do in the future. But so far I guess they actually have good chances to even advance into the US market if maybe still in the future they'll have the chance to collaborate with a western artist.. But then there's the enlistment...so maybe no?

&amp;#x200B;

D.O:

I admire how he endured it for many years to do both acting and singing and I wonder if it's good if he will continue to do both..I don't want to spread rumors..but some fans have said on other sites that they think he might be tired of the idol life..which he actually stated himself in jyp party people..and sometimes watching exo, I think as ""a veteran idol"" one might feel tired and not interested in doing aegyo and all the stuff that rookie idols all must do... Following d.o since overdose era, I think one day it's just enough..

&amp;#x200B;

But seeing how exo will all enlist one by one, I think as a group they may not be too busy so D.O could peacefully continue acting and stay with exo.. I don't doubt though that he might one day think about joining an acting company.. But I believe in exo's strong friendship and considering their past, I can't imagine D.O leaving exo/sm one day? But we never know.. It surely would make me sad... 

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's his talent in singing..I think his vocals have so much more potential.. Hearing him belting out sorts of notes and singing exo songs in a different way at concert videos, even seeing him rapping in one song makes me think he could easily also choose a solo career and release some rnb album and do music like dean/zion t/crush or am I too bold to say that?

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I think he wouldn't want to quit acting..his potential now after swing kids and 100 days prince is just too strong and too wasteful to not to continue pursuing..

&amp;#x200B;

I just want our dear kyungsoo to be able to live a quieter life away from the busy idol life and be more of himself which I think as I saw from behind the scene videos he really can do as actor rather as idol...

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean after the military he could:

&amp;#x200B;

1) continue as before and maybe HOPEFULLY one day soon release a solo album on the side just like baekhyun and chen...

&amp;#x200B;

Or 

&amp;#x200B;

2) if the exo contract expires... I don't know I wouldn't doubt as I said that he actually would only choose acting in the end but.. We all don't wanna lose OT8... With exo I don't think it's only business relations like some kpop groups proved to be(???) ... A fans perception might be far away from reality though I guess..",20,3

And i pray that does not happen to exo or anyone unless they are guilty. But I really want to know this. And i know we all are waiting for the exo comeback and i dont know want to kill all your happy bubble.You guys know the recent happening in monsta x wonho and shownu. They are being bought out into the public for their mistakes. Wonho for his past and debt and shownu for his affair with a married woman without his knowledge of her being married. And the girl han so hee is the one giving juicy informations. I didnt even know this girl but later i came to know she has dragged many idols....all male idols. From popular boy groups. And exo is at the top of the chain . And this was before the monsta x comeback too. Will this girl pull this kind of stunt with exo too?? Is she able too?? More importantly does any exo member have any past?? Or even if she did, will exo be strong enough to withstand it?? I know exo had scandals before, but those are dating and members leaving which are completely on the innocent side. I just watched a kpop channel kermy talking about this and i realised quite how dangerous she is. She knows all the inside information and somehow like i said is always targeting boy groups.  Not that she should target girl groups. By the way i am neither defending nor attacking wonho and shownu. I dont bias monstax , so i dont know them. So what do you guys think??",12,0

&gt;Questionable beings have been spotted around the globe, causing abnormal activities. It was witnessed by many that these beings, radiating red energy, move and create phenomena beyond human level. From research, it has been confirmed there are a total of six of these exotic beings. They are assumed to be similar in form with &lt;EXO&gt;, a being that has been tracked for long now.

And on the bottom of the gif/video the member's names are scrolling in normal writing and symbol writing.

What are your theories on how this is all going to go down? What kind of predictions do you have for the MV? What things do you think are connected? Have we been seeing X-EXO all this time? Where did the real EXO go? Will the red force take over???? What IG/Photos/MVs/Moments do you think spoiled this comeback?

# Vote for the BEST Stages [Round 2]

In the last round, you voted out your least fave stages from each concert series. Now you must vote for your faves for each series from what is left\~ Good luck!

**How to Play:**

1. If you haven't seen EXO's concerts, it's time for you to cancel all your plans this week &amp; weekend and watch them!
2. When you watch, keep in mind the stages you think were the best, brought the most energy and just blew you away! Don't just think of it as ""Oh, I love this song so its automatically my fave stage!"", watch ALL the stages because a lot of the time EXO Stages can change your outlook on the song, especially where its placed in the concert!
3. Go vote out those stages you listed from above! I am being extra nice this week and giving you a full week to answer this round because I know its more effort to rewatch (or watch for the first time!). ***You have until next Tuesday, November 19 to vote!***
4. Come back NEXT Tuesday to see what r/EXO's top songs for EACH concert is!

Because I am EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA nice, I will link you the concerts here below for you to rewatch ;)

[Dancing King with Yoo Jaesuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EiNsoTc9kk)! It's just so fun and the beat and art of the video really just get me so excited and happy it's such a great mood picker upper!

And then another super great song is [Drop That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CfyWokByn8)!

To commemorate our favourite long-legged idol, here are some of the things Chanyeol has done in the last year\~



I first want to congratulate him on his new studio [NNG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4vlBiZ4Ua8Uzm9z91Qn1g)! He is always super proud of all his babies and we know how much of his heart he puts into all his projects, so please support him!

I love that Chanyeol was able to go out with [Dynamic Duo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw5d1csgy7I) and perform at a club without any worries. His happiness absolutely shines through!

Chanyeols amazing Vogue 'Holding Sunshine' Volumes [one](https://imgur.com/a/y89Cl09) and [two](https://imgur.com/a/zli6veA) (my personal favourites)

When Chanyeol went to the Tommy Hilfiger event and looked like the [cutest baby ever](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/6a/18/196a18e6362c2a95d55164ca8b3aa25b.jpg) dressed up in a blue jean jacket and blue jeans. When he went to Prada's [SS19 event](https://media.cleo.com.sg/2019/04/chanyeol-prada-singapore-interview-3.jpg) in Singapore. His [airport](https://66.media.tumblr.com/29f34547770cf5a89b8b760aac117148/tumblr_pqo86iPExt1riav2to1_1280.jpg) fashion and how he looked when he showed up at Versace's brand event in Hong Kong was [stunning](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8DtZUYVsAEd37J?format=jpg&amp;name=small) ([and adorable](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5W6LgvXoAcd6EV?format=jpg&amp;name=small)!)  
Of course Prada can't let him go, inviting him to their [pop up shop](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJpiUkOXYAI-WbG?format=jpg&amp;name=small) and throwing us super cute [finger hearts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJZmckkWoAAnZrC?format=jpg&amp;name=small)\~

Chanyeol was also chosen to be the face of the perfume brand 'Acqua Di Parma' for their perfume 'Mirto Di Panarea' and her he is looking all sorts of [handsome](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1194517094299140096?s=20) at their SIGNATURE of the SUN VIP PARTY - Acqua Di Parma Fansign Event!

Last but not least I want to quickly congratulate Chanyeol on winning 'Most Popular Male Singer' and 'Most Popular Overseas Singer'at the 2019 Tencent Music Entertainment Awards 2019!



Happy birthday Chanyeol! I hope this year has been great for you and wishing you continuous success and health!

# About Song Showdown

Every week for the next little bit we will be revisiting all of the EXO members discographies in a showdown to discover [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO/)'s Top 5 songs for each Solo, Subunit and Full Group. Every Tuesday we will be voting out our LEAST fave songs and on Fridays we will be voting for our faves.

If you have any suggestions on new games, or rounds that would work for Song Showdown, please let me know below\~

# Ko Ko Bop vs. Power Results

This was a tough one for me in particular, because I felt like I loved how much EXO enjoyed performing Power more but I think the choreo for KKB is ""technically"" better. Lets see what you all thought.... 

|QUESTION|1st Place|2nd Place|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Which title track is your fave?|Ko Ko Bop (70%)|Power (30%)|
|Which music video did you enjoy more?|Power (52%)|Ko Ko Bop (48%)|
|Which song has better Choreography?|Ko Ko Bop (74%)|Power (26%)|
|Which title track is overall stronger?|Ko Ko Bop (74%)|Power (26%)|

# Play this Round: Monster vs. Lucky one

Lets do some super quick rounds\~ This vote will close on Friday, meaning it is only ONE round. BUT for this particular round, the winner will go on to go against Lotto this Friday\~ Be sure to post performances etc below in the comments to fight for your fave track!

**Please only vote once, this is just a game, it is all for fun, there are no true answers here.**
