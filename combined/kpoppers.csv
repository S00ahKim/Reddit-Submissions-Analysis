Have you wanted to discuss, critique and learn about Kpop on the go? I wanted introduce a kpop podcast I've been working on for the past year. It's called ""Kpopcast"" and you can listen to the weekly program from your phone on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kpopcastshow), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kpopcast/id1133068655?mt=2), [Google](https://play.google.com/music/m/Itifq5exzrsnme5ldokwmmmshia?t=Kpopcast), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/peter-lo/karea), etc (really anywhere you can find a podcast). We review the latest releases in kpop, provide weekly song recommendations, and bring on subject matter experts to weigh in around a topic. I think podcasting as a medium is still fairly nascent for the kpop crowd, but hope you give us a listen and consider subscribing!

We're not the only one doing this. See [this post here](https://kpopcast.net/2017/09/10/12-kpop-podcasts-to-listen-to/) on some other fun podcasts you can find and reasons to listen to each. 

We're continuing to tweak and perfect the show format based on listener feedback so if you have some constructive criticism we're receptive to that too. ",3,4

My friend is new to reddit so I'm helping her out. She's a huge fan of kpop and kdramas but she lives in central Florida where there's not much support/fandom. She created a Youtube channel so she can connect with more fans and I'd like to share her stuff so she can get more exposure. 

If you live in the Orlando area, please let us know if there are groups/clubs she can get involved with so she can meet more fans! And it would be super cool if you could check out her videos and maybe like/subscribe to them if you're interested. 

[Here's her video discussing how she got into kpop and wants to know how you got into it too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVX9BzI3cW4)

[This video is how she got into kdramas, which lead to her love for kpop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWpCa7xRqw4)

I should mention she is a HUGE fan of BTS. 

Her username on reddit is [InfatuKated](u/InfatuKated).

Between r/bangtan and r/kpop, I feel like I've seen a decent amount of self-admissions of some degree of mental illness. This makes me feel two things: 1) yay solidarity!!!! 2) awww lots of people aren't feeling so good. It was World Mental Health Day 2017 on Tuesday, so this has been on my mind.


I figured we could share resources to help each other out. I'm sure there will be days when you're too ""tired""/tired and/or have too too few [spoons](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) to add a rung to that ladder, so maybe the posts that accumulate here can be an easy rung :). Please offer up one non-kpop thing and one kpop thing.


I'll start: For kpop, I usually watch a Bangtan Bomb, this one of [Jimin trying to make Jungkook laugh](https://youtu.be/kAnTcz1cCAQ) is especially helpful. For non-kpop, if I can manage it, I go to a park. If not, I watch cooking videos on YouTube since I really like cooking so it's kind of like I'm doing it???

I don't really listen to K-pop myself, but I figure this is a good place to ask this question:
Has anyone else noticed the amount of misandry within the k-pop community, specifically coming from many teen girls?
Like almost everytime I see some misandrist post on Instagram, Twitter or anything, like ""men are trash"", ""i hate men""  I go onto their profiles and almost every time they have some member of a k-pop band as their profile pic or in their posts. They don't seem to hate the k-pop guys they post about, considering the ""JASKDLASDA I LOVE HIM SO MUCH""  yet they say ""i hate men"" and ""men are trash"" 
I can't be the only one who's noticed, this, so, anyone?

**2.)**  Get LIVE Role
    Go to #bias_picker and add LIVE role. We will ping you shortly before the show starts.

**3.)** Watch on Rabbit
    On Sat. 9:15 PM KST, go to https://www.rabb.it/sekl to watch the show and chat with everyone.
     If the room is full, we will ask a volunteer to open a second room.

**4.)** Read Live-subs in Discord
    In our discord server, go to #live_translations to read live subs.
    Our awesome Translators team will try to do as best as they can, but remember it is still 100% by volunteer by other members.
    Don't forget to thank them afterwards!

**5.)** Live Party Voice Channel
    If your wifi can still handle, we also have a Live Viewing Party VC for those interested.


Week 1 will be an experiment for all of us, so feedback in #suggestions afterwards would be appreciated.
That's all! Get HYPED, and enjoy! 

**Feel free to stay for:** 

-Live Chatrooms / Fast Updates / Fun Facts / News about about the show

-Channels with content for each individual participant / group

-Watch the show together and chat with other kpop fans &amp; More!

Come join the hype in anticipation for EPISODE 1!!

We know who you are,
We know your ways. 

We know that your teeth are dull but your tongue is sharp,
Like a leech,
You draw life from vein,

Loneliness is your welcome,
And we know that youre definitely
The creative type because 
Sometimes you weave the doormat yourself.

Dear Depression,

Many hear your whispers 
And fall,
But the strong stand between us and you;

Strong are those who stand against the screams,
But those who keep grounded 
Instead of running,
Are not invincible.

To guard us,
They hurt too. 


Dear Depression,

Its our turn.

I hate to break it to you, 
But
I cant let you take them.
I wont let you take them.
Do you see?
These are the people we love
And love can conquer anything.
Even you.

There is always a way to thwart you.
Though you are clever, 
We are more.

You are not going to take them.

You are not going to take from us.

You are not going to take them from their families.

Not anymore.
As long as we are here, you will have to get through us.

You will not take Xiumin, nor Chanyeol, nor Suho, nor Sehun, nor Baekhyun, nor Lay, nor Kyungsoo, nor Chen, nor Kai, nor Jimin, nor Jin, nor Suga, nor Namjoon, nor Hobi, nor V, nor Jungkook, nor Taemin, nor Minho, nor Onew, nor Key, nor Jisoo, nor Rose, nor Jennie, nor Lisa, nor Yeri, nor Irene, nor Joy, nor Wendy, nor Seulgi, nor Mark, nor Jackson, nor Yugyeom, nor Jinyoung, nor Bambam, nor Jaebum, nor Younjae, nor Chenle, nor Taeyeon...

Dear Depression,

Dont even think for one second
That you have Jonghyun.
Dont even think for one second
You think you have broken us.
Because YOU have united us. 

We are one, under Jonghyun,
An angel who holds us together with his smiles,
Who loved us through his pain.

Now, he lives within us,
Within his family,
Within his music,
Within his group.

And nothing you can do will ever take him away.
I hope you know that. 

And dear Idols,

Never forget that you are loved. You are strong. No matter what happens, we will support you. We promise. Dont ever be afraid to take care of yourselves because you know what is best for you. 

And we will trust you until the end. 

With utmost appreciation, 
                                  The fans. 

(Add your favorite idols if I missed them...THEY ALL DESERVE SUPPORT NO MATTER WHAT FANDOM YOU'RE APART OF! WE ARE ONE COMMUNITY LOVE YOU GUYS) ",0,8

Im working on a psychology project examining how ones music preferences and personality are related to their work and other relevant outcomes.  I pretested the survey for length, if you have just 15 minutes to spare, can communicate fluently in the written form of the English language, are at least 18 years old, and are either working in a paid capacity or attending school you are eligible to participate.  I will be granting access to your personal results through a password-protected system.  If you would be willing to help a young student out, I would really appreciate your time and effort.

If you guys could make a group using ANY idols you want (Active or inactive, doesn't matter) to form your Unit, who would you all like to see work together and which song would you love to see them cover?

You can have as many or as few members that you want, it's your dream unit so take this question in any direction you want.

Jihyo - lawful good

Other:

PSY - chaotic neutral 
YG - neutral evil
JYP - chaotic good 

Do you agree with mine? How about your favorites and where they'd fall in the chart?



Edit: after looking over my list, I noticed that my biases and ""bias wreckers"" tend to be ""chaotic"" idols...

I like to think they are fairly diverse playlists tho so I hope any of you who check it out enjoy most of the songs on them! or just check them out to disagree with me hahaha

Feel free to disagree and argue with me about my rankings (you might even change my mind) but let's keep it friendly ;)

This is my [Top 75 Kpop songs of 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkYYtowiwfg-vchifYfnYa8EUfn-jZpx).

Same as last year I tried to make a Top 50 and I just couldn't do it. A lot of the lower songs a subject to moving up/down based on my mood tbh but I tried to put them in a fairly cemented place as best I could!

This one is also an annual playlist I've started doing, my [Top 100 Kpop songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkYYtowiwfhUgb2NTlC4evbsvvdVOArS&amp;disable_polymer=true).

This list is my all time favourite Kpop songs as of 1/1/18 it was much harder than the other one to make as I had to cut about 20 songs that had made the list last year.

Oh and the playlist is ordered such that my favourite song is the last song to play - just to clear up any confusion.",1,2

With the others (at least Minho and Taemin) we've some idea of what's happening with them...even if it is things getting cancelled it's still news. 

Onew has beed radio-silent. I mean he got bashed for past stuff, slammed when he tried to rejoin the group (they demanded he leave), then his group member dies, he gets relegated to being a paul bearer (he originally had either Jonghyun's sister or Minho's position) and now just...nothing.

I know he needs time and all but I want to know what is in the future for him in relation to being a member of the team and if they'll continue moving forward as a group of 4. ",2,6

Instead of giving out awards for the ""best of K-Pop"", these awards will be for the strangest, funniest, and downright worst of K-Pop in 2017.

**How to nominate and vote**

Categories for the Razzies can be anything your hearts can imagine.  So the first step is to post whatever category you want in the comments below.  Then other users (or even you) can add nominees to that category.  Be sure to include pictures and links when appropriate.  Everyone else upvotes the nominees they want to win.  At the end of the voting period, we'll take the top 25 most upvoted categories and announce the winners on r/kpop.

**The voting period will end on January 15th at around 00:00 est.**

Remember to have fun and don't be too mean.  We will definitely be poking fun at idols and groups in this thread, but it's not open season to completely trash them or their fans.  Comments that cross the line will be removed.",613,48

Some background - a discussion earlier today with my friends about Asian music lead to them talking about Korea and agreeing that the west has influenced their music, and vice versa they have influenced western music. But the kicker, stupidly, is that none of them could really say why they thought it, and I'm a pretty new listener of KPOP so didn't really have a lot to say. So now I'm genuinely curious what other people think, and I could only think of asking on here because it has been grating on me all day that I couldn't really answer it myself - has the west influenced Korean music, and has KPOP influenced the west? 

Thoughts?

Im working on a psychology project examining how ones music preferences and personality are related to their work and other relevant outcomes.  I pretested the survey for length, if you have just 15 minutes to spare, can communicate fluently in the written form of the English language, are at least 18 years old, and are either working in a paid capacity or attending school you are eligible to participate.  I will be granting access to your personal results through a password-protected system.  If you would be willing to help a young student out, I would really appreciate your time and effort.

Thanks again,

138,2018-1-28,2018,1,28,7,7tg9o6,Idol Star Athletics Championships women's 4x100m relay results compilation,leftylink,1517093648,"Hi. About two weeks ago, the Idol Star Athletics Championships were held and they will be broadcast soon.

I took a special interest in the women's 4x100m relay and thus decided to collect the results from every single instance of this relay ever run, at https://pastebin.com/1US9yKDA. They're in YAML format so if you want to parse the data and do some analysis on it I suppose that would be possible.

I'm not sure why I take such an interest in Idol Athletics. Something to do with:

* We know k-pop group members need to be fit enough to sing and dance on stage, but now we are curious as to whether they are fit in other ways as well
* Well, being fit is a good thing no matter what your job is, isn't it? It's interesting to see who keeps themselves fit
* At the end of the day, just looking for more reasons to like your favourites

Why the 4x100m race in particular? Probably because it's relatively easy to collect results for (as opposed to, say, archery!)... and because I also used to run races. Not saying I was any good at running, but nevertheless I did run.

Sistar was dominant in relay for a long time, but starting in 2013 they no longer ran, even though they were still participating in archery. I wonder why. Then 2013-2015 was an era of mostly A Pink wins, though strong contenders EXID and Dal Shabet each take one win, and Sistar makes one triumphant return in 2015. Oh My Girl emerged as strong contenders and took two wins in a row by a large margin (4-5 seconds). Funnily enough, both of those wins were against the same opponents. Oh My Girl has always fielded the exact same team, except for this most recent event where Jiho sat out presumably because of her injury. Wondering if a new era is here or if Jiho will make a triumphant return next time.

149,2018-1-30,2018,1,30,9,7twtsd,It's the zombie apocalypse. You get to make a roster of 10 idols to join your survival team. Who do you pick? (but there are rules),Im_Currently_High,1517270642,"**Rules:**

1. You only get 2 idols from one specific group. (keeps this whole exercise interesting)

2. Your roster cant be one gender (must have at least one male and female)

3. Dont base your picks only on your biases. You can pick your favorites for some of them, but remember, you must survive the apocalypse! Make sure you think strategically. 

___
___


**Bonus options:**

1. Explain why you made each pick.

2. Who are your honorable mentions? Why didn't they make the list?

___
___



**My picks:**

1. **Jisoo** - BlackPink - My ultimate bias. I must protect her at all costs.

2. **Jennie** - BlackPink - Well rounded and seems to have a good strategic 
mind. Also has great chemistry with Jisoo. They make a great dynamic duo.

3. **Sana** - Twice - Shes hilarious and will keep morale high. Its the apocalypse, someone needs to entertain us, and that will be her job. (although her clumsiness could prove to be a liability But no Sana no life, am I right?!?!)

4. **Jihyo** - Twice - The best leader in Kpop. She knows how to unify large groups of people and is always there to comfort her fellow team members. Plus she has proven to be an extremely dedicated and hard worker. (She will also keep Sana in line when shit gets serious)

5. **Seulgi** - Red Velvet - You just KNOW Seulgi would kick ass during an apocalypse. The girl is bad ass as fuck.

6. **Yeri** - Red Velvet - Although she may seem small and lack physical strength, I have a feeling Yeri would end up being a surprisingly good asset in an apocalypse. She seems resourceful and like she may come up with some outside the box solutions to problems when we are in a bind. 

7. **Somi** - I.O.I - She's young, but has a lot of potential. Shes a blackbelt in taekwondo. She learned from her father (who you should check out, he's an awesome guy). I think it's safe to assume she probably also learned some other badass shit from him as well.

8. **BM** - Kard - Have you seen him? He's shredded. Simply from a physical strength perspective he makes sense. He is also from America (like me) so itd be nice to have someone with similar cultural background to relate to. 

9. **T.O.P.** - BigBang - Not only is he cool and funny, but hes a taller fellow and has some military training. Easy pick. 

10. **RM** - BTS - Im not even a big BTS fan or anything, but RM is clearly a genius. If you watch him in interviews (both English and Korean) he just comes off as a multitalented and intelligent individual. Plus hed make a great leader with Jihyo.


___
___


**Honorable mentions:**

1. **Lisa/Rose** - BlackPink - I love these girls (BlackPink is my favorite group), but there's the pick two rule So I had to go with Jisoo/Jennie instead.

2. **Dahyun** - Twice - Shes my twice Bias, but strategically she doesnt work in my lineup. 

3. **Jeongyeon** - Twice - Bad ass like Seulgi of RV. She would probably kick butt as well.

4. **J.Y. Park** - Does he count as an idol? I couldn't decide, so I ultimately didn't put him in the roster. However, if we do count him as an idol, then I would definitely put him on my team. Whether you like him and his music or not, you must admit he is a strategic genius. JYP artists are killing it financially lately, and it's arguably because J.Y. Park runs one of the most efficient companies in Kpop. He would be a fantastic leader and strategists.

Personally, I'd love it for them to debut some girls to rival BlackPink in concept and swag. A super cool, chic and girl crush group, with an emphasis on hip-hop is what I imagine. I think it would be cool for them to be advertised as BTS's little sister group and I think a lot of BTS fans would stan them too. BH definitely has the money to splash on superb training, great music, concept design and flashy music videos.

However do you think because of the natural association with BTS, there would be backlash from fans? Fangirls are notoriously possessive and could the debut of a girl group backfire for BH and the potential girls? Would they be attacked for ""stealing their Oppas"" ? Is this possibly why BH *hasn't* debuted a girl group so far? 

What are your thoughts on a BigHit girl group?",4,0

For example, I swapped out the members of EXO-K and EXO-M with the Ooo and Aaa Adventure Time characters respectively. 

(OK, maybe second weirdest).

So in terms of GG/SNSD, I thought about all of Gainax mainly because it would preserve the double G in English. **If you were to swap out the SoShi with any Gainax character, who would be who?**

Alternatively, **which Gainax characters could you see SNSD members replacing/cosplaying?**

Feel free to be ridiculous! (e.g., swap Seohyun with Gendo,  etc.)",1,1

73,2018-2-16,2018,2,16,15,7xx29i,A Sad Classic: SuJu's Heechul and Red Velvet's Seulgi,Zenosignia,1518764399,"Heechul, known as Red Velvet's ""Mother"", is like that big brother who takes care of his dongsaengs. He is close to them, but he is closest to Seulgi, who he calls his ""Butterfly"" (it was revealed that his name for Seulgi in his phone contacts is actually Butterfly).

They have shown so much chemistry and closeness that you just know they are very fond of each other. It's actually cute. You can see Seulgi on Heechul's stream while he was playing League of Legends, you can see Heechul playing games with her, even personally feeding her, and you can just notice the obvious level of comfort between the two. Heechul on a number of times has mentioned ""*I really like her eyes*"". On many occasions he has casually mentioned this.

In Idol Weekly, when the members of Red Velvet were asked to draw Heechul, we can see how they actually perceive him. The members drew him in a funny, unflattering way, which was funny.

Except for Seulgi. She drew Heechul as she sees him, handsome, lovable, charming.

The dynamics between them is adorable.

But here's my theory. I think underneath it all is a Korean drama classic: the narrative of two people unable to admit their feelings to each other.

Heechul believes that Red Velvet members see him as a big brother, a caretaker who will never break that trust by having romantic attachments to anyone. *I can never tell her how I feel.*

At the same time, Seulgi thinks that Heechul sees her only as a younger sister. *He will never look at me that way.*

And so it goes, each of them unable to express what they really think of each other, hiding their true feelings behind innocent smiles and playful laughter, never quite knowing that they are made for each other :(",9,4

For instance:

* [Hani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZvpXTc8Eg4) and [Jungkook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQB9DRyzR34&amp;t=1m22s) would be/are able to sleep anywhere, at anytime, which is both super helpful for their work and also just a generally useful life skill.

* Taemin would be able to switch between his [2008-fetus-self](https://imgur.com/a/XU040) and [his current evolution](https://imgur.com/a/r27hs). I think this would be useful for hiding in crowds, playing on playgrounds without being judged, and memes.

* NCT ([2018 version](https://imgur.com/a/IdNYw)) would be able to fit all 18 members into a very small car (a la [clown car](https://imgur.com/a/RvFW0)) which would make travel more convenient and save gas money.

What mundane superpowers would other idols have?

I wanted to keep the team to 4 for simplicity sake, and I encourage you to write why the members that you have chosen deserve to be on your all-star roster. 

Rules: Keep it to single gendered teams and currently active k-pop idols. I understand this may just be a post about everyone listing off their biases from each group until it adds up to 4, but try to be a little objective!

My 2018 All-Star Team:

 1. Nayeon (TWICE) - Incredibly versatile vocalist, charismatic and natural leader. The backbone for this team.

 2. Seulgi (Red Velvet) - The jill-of-all-trades. Most well rounded idol on this team, basically thrives in all areas.

 3. Lisa (BLACKPINK) - I value a strong rapper when I see one (/r/hiphopheads I see you famo). Has one of the most unique flows (in both English and Korean) and serves as an incredible dancer as well. No debate here.

 4. Wendy (Red Velvet) - Phenomenal vocals. She was sort of my flex pick for a few reasons: Couldn't leave out the 6ix Goddess (forever making Toronto proud), Seulgi's other half and brings a strong international presence, alongside Lisa.

Anyway have fun with your list! There isn't any one winner all-star group as each of these idols not only bring so much to the table but these picks are YOUR picks (which comes with its own emotional attachment). Love to see all the great teams &lt;3

13,2018-3-3,2018,3,3,10,81l2zz,The Kpop Mullet from a fashion theory perspective.,ashortgreyroundcat,1520040938,"Im not here to convince you to love the Kpop Mullet, or even to like it in very specific cases as I do. Im just here to discuss why its 2018 and we still have the mullet in Korean fashion from a fashion history nerd perspective.  

The beginnings of the modern mullet happened in the 70s and has close ties to counter-culture movements and rock legends like David Bowies Ziggy Stardust and Patti Smith. It was a statement of sexual revolution, a switching of gender perceptions and railing against conventional beauty standards. The reason why contemporary mainstream western audiences are appalled by the mullet is largely socioeconomic. Somewhere along its journey in pop culture, the mullet went from a look shared in rock/punk/metal communities to being code for low-class and uneducated. As well as being tied to a specific point in time: 80s/90s Americana and for lack of a better term, tackiness. Basically, its an aesthetic signifier of a time and type of person that far outshadowed its countercultural origins.  


There has been a slight resurgence of the look that aims to capture its original sense of rebellion but in softer variations. Marc Jacobs sent it down his [runways in 2013](https://cameblogdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/picture-16.png) and [Rihanna](http://starcrush.com/files/2013/09/rihanna-mullet-4.jpg) sported it for a bit. Die Antwoords [Yolandas hair](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/48/19/38/4819380a095f9fb43db8c71d7346bfc8.jpg) is practically iconic and just this year we saw a mullet straight off the Gucci runway. All this brings the look back to the global spotlight, which brings me to Seoul.  


Seoul right now is having a [style boom of 90s aesthetics](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f61b56a03954e54813/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS4778.jpg), largely due to the popularity of streetwear which pulls heavily from its [80s](https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_2000%2Cq_75%2Cw_2000/MTUwODgxMjU0NjA1NDY1NTQ1/15-seoul-fashion-week-street-style-spring-2018.jpg) hip hop and [90s](https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_2000%2Cq_75%2Cw_2000/MTUwODgxMjU0ODczNzY5OTI5/25-seoul-fashion-week-street-style-spring-2018.jpg) skate culture/grunge origins. Its [colorful](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f771f7d807707514b0/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS5829.jpg), [casual](http://cdn.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2017/10/hbs-sfw-ss18-day-1-street-style-17-1200x800.jpg), with an emphasis on [tongue-in-cheek references](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e9006cee32f97c78ecb112/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS2802.jpg) and big statement logos. But it is also filtered through a Korean lens (i.e. [texture offset by clean minimalist cuts](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e652001b56a03954e546d8/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS8155.jpg), and a very [sarcastic sense of humor](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e7b2cf1b56a03954e54749/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS0556.jpg) to the messaging.) It could be argued that the popularity in streetwear in Korea is a combination of the global growth of luxury sportswear, the tendency of the domestic market to skew to young consumers, as well as a feeling of casual rebellion. In a space where you spend most of your youth in a school uniform streetwear becomes this easy, casual subversive element. So with the Kpop mullet (yes I define it as a specific variation in the same way that a 2-block cut is specific variation of a bowl/mushroom cut) youre pulling elements of streetwear nostalgia, punk/rocker [subversion](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f37b212f10e9346bc3/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS4205.jpg), and high fashion which this mixing together is VERY on trend in Seoul and lacks the western associations of class. Its things like this that actually gives Korea a leg up in the international markets with a lot of young Korean designers being on the radar of big buyers and publications like Vogue and Selfridges.  


In closing, if you made it this far, HI! Thank you? Theres a lot more I could say to the history of the hairstyle in counter-cultures (esp. queer culture) but listen this is a Kpop reddit. Im probably stretching things pretty thin as is. I guess I just [cant get over JB?](https://imgur.com/a/Lw54W) I kid. In actuality I think if you look at the concepts in recent years theres a definite uptick in 90s styling and I dont think enough people acknowledge it as being part of a larger cultural movement.",11,38

For me, it's EXID's LE.  She's one of the best female rappers in K-Pop, but most people don't realize that she's also an amazing vocalist.  I love this [short cover of Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05OMVh96v-g) she did for JUSE.  She even appeared on [King of Masked Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6h0yTJPSLo) and did a fantastic job.  I want, no NEED, an LE solo album at some point.  She can definitely pull it off and I'm confident that her and Sinshasong Tiger could produce a major hit if it ever happened.",58,23

The group currently consists of 23 members from the USA, The Philippines, Canada, Afghanistan, and multiple other countries. Of those 23 members, about 10 are active on a daily basis. Mostly everyone in the GroupMe favors BlackPink above all other groups, but we still love plenty of other Kpop as well (Red Velvet and Twice are pretty popular amongst us). Ages in the chat range from 16-29, but we are currently only accepting 18+ members. 

Do to the nature of such a diverse group of people, we have culminated a very welcoming community of open minded individuals. We dont judge each other, and we love to learn about our differences and similarities through social media and the one thing that ultimately unites us: Kpop. 

We have been a community for almost half a year now, and we talk on a daily basis. Recently however the group hasnt been as active, and we are looking to shake it up by adding new members. Please keep in mind that this group contains many different personalities. Because of this, our only requirement is that you are respectful and do your best to keep an open mind.

In the Acworth, Georgia area we are trying to arrange a K-pop dance cover group. In the group, we would practice choreography from k-pop and j-pop songs. Afterwards, we would record them and upload them online, and perform them at various public events (competitions, conventions, etc.). We would not only dance, but create clothing too! We would sew our outfits for video recordings and performances to match the style of the original artists, as well as the personality of our group. However, knowing how to sew is not a requirement for joining the group!

In addition to dancers to be a part of the group, were looking for an editor and a manager too! We would like an editor to capture content of the group practicing and performing, then edit it into videos that could be uploaded online! We would also like a manager to assist the group in planning events that we could participate in.

This would be an amazing opportunity to not only create art, but to also form friendships and enhance your resume! As a group, we would not only practice and perform with each other, but hang out with each other too. A bond goes a long way in increasing the quality of a groups performance. Being a part of this group would allow you to say that you had experience performing with a dance organization, filming and editing, or managing!

If youre interested, live in the Acworth area, and are at least 18 years old, please email us @cover.group.castings@gmail.com

The presentation is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of idiomatic Korean most of the implications will go over a typical viewers head. Theres also the singers' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their media training - their personal philosophy draws heavily from Joseon Era literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realise that theyre not just fun - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike K-Pop truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Park Jiyeons existential catchphrase Neona jalhassaeyo, which itself is a cryptic reference to Park Chan Wook's 2005 classic ' '. Im smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the imported Swedish songwriters' genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a JYP tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Its for the ladies eyes only - and even then they have to demonstrate that theyre within 5 TOPIK levels of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",1,14

(Im just envisioning an mv mashup though, not a full production.) I personally am too green (and biased) to make an iconic list, but I know many of you have been around for years. 

So, by year, nominate the most iconic song of the year. I think we should limit this to idol groups only, and we will do at least one boy and one girl group song per year. (Years may end up having more than 2 songs, we will see.)

Also please recommend what year we should start with! :) 2017 will be the final year. 

Limit nominations to the song itself, not the mv or dancing. Those would be their own evolutionary tracks I think.

I will collect nominations and if needed, make a poll for final selections. ",1,2

Whether it's a pair you ship or your biases. I already have 8 pairs selected (upon request) and will pick the remaining ones on FCFS-basis. So the earlier you submit your pairs, the earlier they will appear on the next generation :)

There are three restrictions:

1. Winners of any generation can't be selected for any future generation, unless it's a Quarter Quell.

2. No exact same pairs as the previous generation can be selected, although they can in a different teamup.

3. Every team should be in a different category. For instance: you can't have a second 'YG Males' team in the same generation.

All pairs submitted after the 12th pair has been selected, will automatically be put in future generations.

I will let you know as soon as possible if your pair has been approved :)",10,2

I've seen Sixteen at least 3 times, and all of this not at the time, but I've read opinions about it from the time it was out and I find myself confused. Ignoring skill and talent, the members of Sixteen seemed vastly more ready to debut than the Produce 101 girls do in these first two episodes, and I thought most of the Sixteen members seemed nervous and obviously green. Yet, from most of the comments I've read about Sixteen when it was coming out and Twice when they debuted, they were compared unfavorably with other girl groups. Obviously there is a lot to be learned from being on a real stage and performing in front of a crowd, so who Twice are now is not comparable to who they were when they were on Sixteen, but the gap between the Sixteen girls and the Produce 101 girls seems even larger.

Were the Sixteen criticisms because they were all from JYP, or because there weren't a ton of survival shows out at the time, or something else I am missing? Maybe Produce 101 had those same criticisms and I just haven't seen them as much. I'm just looking for some perspective. I'm sure the girls get a lot better over the course of Produce 101 and I plan on watching all of it, but so far I'm just confused on what I (perhaps incorrectly) perceive as the contemporaneous reactions to the two shows.",2,1

Sorry if this is a repost of another thread.)

This question has been on my mind for a while now. BTS is a very talented group, and yes, they deserve the attention because they worked really hard for it! What I want to know is why didn't other older groups like SHINee, DB5K, and BIGBANG, receive the same amount of attention that BTS is currently getting worldwide, especially in the US? While I do know that some of these groups had shows in the US (i.e. Kcon, Wonder Girls touring with the Jonas Brothers, B.A.P. doing shows in the States), I'm looking for more reasons/opinions on the actual success of BTS. Talent aside, do you think it was better marketing and better investment? An increased interest in K-Pop over the last decade? What could have been done differently for other groups that wanted to become successful worldwide, or even if they had done a US debut? 

I became a Kpop fan a decade ago and it just amazes me at how successful BTS has been. I'm not part of the fandom, but I do support them because their success is opening more doors for groups (and solos) to go international. I'm not saying that the other groups aren't popular/successful since they have a large fanbase as well. The attention for the other groups feels more from the groups' respective fandoms/general kpop fans while the attention for BTS seems to be from their fandom, general kpop fans, and then the broader, worldwide audience.

157,2018-4-24,2018,4,24,3,8edjoh,What do you think of the new artists and girl groups formed post-IOI disbandment?,thestormkraken,1524506815,"It's been a while since the nation's girl group disbanded and recently, all 11 members had a reunion. I'm not sure if this is still a sensitive topic among IOI fans in this sub but I was wondering what you guys think of the individual and their respective group's future after the disbandment.

Personally, I think everyone who thought that some members would be a flop after IOI is wrong. I'd like to point out Mina for example, although she is presumably living under Sejeong's shadows just like all the other gugudan members, she's surprisingly doing well as a music show MC and in terms of brand reputation, her rank nowadays even beats Sejeong's. She will also star in a drama alongside a popular boy group member as I recall. This is considering how she was perceived by many as the least popular member of IOI during the course of their last promotions. WJSN's Yeonjung is doing well in her group as well, although not too much may be associated to her individual activities, it's still a relief that the name WJSN seems to have a brighter future ahead.

Meanwhile, Pristin's Nayoung and Jieqiong, even being the leader and the visual respectively, did not receive too much recognition while in IOI as compared to the recognition they got after debuting as Pristin. The group won rookie of the year, with Jieqiong being a mentor in China's Idol Producer. I think Nayoung also became a cover for a magazine not too long ago. As a group, I personally think Pristin would be most successful musically, not only because their songs are self-produced by the members, but also because their type of music is well suited to the new generation. This also goes for Weki Meki, although both their name and gugudan's throw off some new prospective listeners, Weki Meki's music is surprisingly good. I also think that the other WeMe members are interesting enough that it would not be much of a hard carry for Yoojung and Doyeon for their part, as much as Sejeong sadly does with gugudan. Doyeon and Yoojung seems to have the most stable and friendlier fanbase that does not alienate other members may it be from IOI or Weki Meki. Their individual activites are also doing well, especially Doyeon who recently collaborated with another singer as far as I remember.

As for Chungha, I think she is the most successful so far in terms of music releases. She is well-supported with good management, her songs ranks high digitally, and her activites as a radio DJ as well as being constantly invited to TV shows and such marks her current relevance. I think she will definitely reach a peak though, where we will all be in awe at how popular she's become. I think I need not go into detail on the individual success Chaeyeon and Sejeong got even after IOI, although both their respective groups are still struggling musically to be known. Both have several CFs, and a promising future for an acting career. Sejeong is still a variety cheat key, now working with Yoo Jae Suk. I still can't even believe Sejeong collaborated for a Station in SM. She is really walking the flowery path way ahead. I think gugudan has a potential to rise sometime, just with a proper song. However, DIA's name in my opinion, would be remembered, but will really struggle to become relevant in the industry as a group.

As for Sohye and Somi, I feel like Sohye's success is already pre-determined, and I don't think she needed fame that much to succeed any further. It would be an exaggeration to say that her mere existence still makes her relevant, but I also think that for some reason its really true. She will definitely not be forgotten even if she does not pursue the idol career. I still doubt Somi's career though, if JYP chooses not to debut her in an idol group soon. Although the girl is widely loved by the public and her visuals as well as talent is no joke, I just feel uncertain of her future. Nevertheless, I think she would be popular, given the proper circumstances, and I'm 90% sure she could even surpass the fame she had during IOI, something that I am still in doubt happening to the other girl's groups during the long run. More or less, I think it was better for them individually when IOI disbanded, as they were each given the promotion and spotlight simultaneously. Yeonjung, however for me, stood out more individually in IOI, albeit the controversies she faced during their promotions compared to her standing in WJSN right now.

I'm sorry for the long post and the bad english. I also want to hear the thoughts on this sub as well.

TLDR; Members post-IOI was not that tragic as everyone thought it would be, I think their future standing will make IOI look like the Avengers soon.

Im not talking about a Hani or Tiffany... no, no thatd be too simple for a stage name. We gotta be extra Were talking G. Dragon, Onew, IU, Raina, etc.            
If I was an idol as my normal male self, Id probably be x-trA, as in literally that extra.          
If I was a female idol though Im sure Id pick a name along the line of Kys and try have it be pronounced Kiss. My fandom name as Kys would iKms just for the ironic acronyms.

But then I realized that there are plenty of good people out there who also enjoy kicking back to some chill jams, so I figured this would be the best place to get suggestions for what I could add to it! Also, I have some artists on there that you may not have heard before, so I hope you give the playlist a listen too. Sorry it's on Apple Music, since I know most of y'all have Spotify, but I'm sure that all these songs can be found on Spotify so you won't miss out. So, If you have a song or two that goes with the feel of the playlist, feel free to leave a suggestion!

edit: Also, I recommend that you put the playlist on shuffle if you listen to it since there a few pockets where it's the same artist like four times in a row and I feel like it's more spicy if you get constant variety in there, but it's up to you",7,5

This is just a quick thought I had, As most people know I think it is fairly undeniable that black culture has played a big part in culture. Music, style and even the way people talk and decide on what is generally popular. Non black people wanting to talk walk and dress/look and act black. With American Cultures impact on Kpop taken into consideration; I was thinking now that Kpop is slowly starting to become more and more mainstream with time, are we going to see more people want to emulate this style and be more ""Korean""/Kpop? More people wanting to go to Korea and learn to speak and act Korean? or more of Korean/Kpop culture/speech/dress/behavior be integrated into mainstream society? Just looking for thoughts and opinions. I personally think that we are seeing the beginning stages of this, but probably wont be as huge but I may very well be wrong. ",5,0

But why do they look so young? They look like they're 16 while before they used to look like they were 25 or so.

You'd never, ever see someone like Fei debut these days. She was 23 when she debuted and their concept wasn't that much more mature but all of them, including Suzy, just seem mid-twenties. 9muses, Dal Shabet, etc all looked like fierce unnis in their mid-twenties as well at the time of debut. But they're the same age as kids debuting nowadays like Nayoung, Dahyun who look like they're 16. The cognitive dissonance is pretty baffling to me; idols used to look like people to look up to, fierce unnis/oppas who seemed more mature in the face were preferred. Now they all look super duper young. But they're the same age.

Boy groups as well; 2pm at 21/22 is VERY different from WannaOne at 21/22. They just look... young. Beyond the concepts and all of that.

As a consequence, I realized that I started thinking that groups like Fiestar, 9muses, Stellar, all seemed super old and could not pull of these cutesy concepts. Is it because the market is dictating that groups look even younger? Soshi at debut seems much more mature and old compared to Twice at debut or Gfriend at debut even when they were the same age.",8,14

3. EXO
4. Big Bang
5. Infinite
6. Seventeen
7. 2PM
8. NCT 127

10. Monsta X (My ultimate bias group but I don't think they deserve the 4th place K-Ville gave them)
11. Super Junior
12. B.A.P
13. SF9
14. The Boyz (idk them either but the comment section called them visual group and I agree)
15. GOT7 (I'M SORRY. I LOVE THEM BUT I HAD TO.)
16. TVXQ
17. Highlight 
18. B1A1
19. UNIQ
20. Pentagon
21. BTS (Tbh Taehyung would be like #2 or 1 on the list of individual handsome members but the group as a whole isn't really a #2 visual group)
22. ASTRO
23. N.Flying
24. Cross Gene
25. Wanna One (DANIEL I LOVE YOU)
26. NU'EST
27. BTOB
28. WINNER (Songs are on point lately but cmon. Jinu may be #1 for prettiest male in Korea but yall aint more handsome than Big Bang no offense)
29. Stray Kids (Handsome-ness. I think their boyish looks are *really* cute but not really handsome. Definitely not #10 worthy compared to their sunbaes)
30. 24K
31. Golden Child
32. Teen Top
33. Block B
34. BOYFRIEND
35. TRCNG
36. The Rose
37. Shinhwa
38. UP10TION
39. VIXX (They're not conventionally handsome so I couldn't put them at the #8 Kville gave them but they're still top10 in my heart)
40. HOTSHOT
41. iKon
42. VICTON
43. MXM
44. VAV
45. CN Blue
46. Imfact
47. A.C.E (I can't help but get this gut feeling that they got a #14 because of their current popularity, not because of unbiased opinions?)
48. JYJ (They aren't in their prime anymore. Shame because they were really handsome)
49. Day6 (I love Day6 but they're not really a visual group. I think more of personality/music/approachability)

CONSIDERING...

Artist freedom and control.
Treatment (includes how freely they can talk, not being too restricted, restriction of phones).
Management
Living Costs: whether they take care of your plane ticket, dorm, food, etc.
Also, I'm curious about the quality of training in each company, but I'm not sure if anybody knows that.

IMO: YG and RBW seem to be best for artistic freedom. The thing is RBW being a smaller company, it may not be as good for foreigners with limited resources (they may have to deal with more expenses than in bigger companies). Hence the Big3 are probably better for living costs. As for treatment JYP seems pretty good agency to me, they have sex &amp; ethics education, everybody seems to be on good terms, they've got (or rather will have) an organic cafeteria (okay, it doesn't say a lot about treatment but I like it). And, finally, I think SM is best for management, but it's on the more strict side (I don't think they're evil tho) and, as seen by the criteria I've given, I'm looking for a more relaxed company (of course not TRULY relaxed, that's impossible on any decent company).

Anyway, what do yall think?",3,8

So I was wondering wether that was completely true for all 3 or they just reduced the amount. 
There's also people saying that you have to pay if you debut too, I assume that you'd have to pay only what they invested on the debut... Right?

And finally, I am really curious about wether there are any companies outside the Big3 that don't charge trainee fees or charge just a portion of it.

Just wanted to clear that out since it's been in my head for a while now. ^_^",2,4

170,2018-5-22,2018,5,22,3,8l39y8,How is trainee life? (Really),K-PopDataGatherer,1526928786,"So... I wanted to know how training is in these companies: 
JYP, YG, SM, CUBE, FAVE, JELLYFISH and FANTAGIO.

In a bit more detail, not the general 'they train for several hours', but how it is on each company: how many hours of training per day, what classes they take (like JYP trainees get sex&amp;ethics education, others don't I believe), how strict it is, evaluations, etc.

I thought perhaps this could be useful for other people too (like those interested in auditioning for k-pop companies), so I thought I would post this here to put what I find (which, for now, isn't much BTW) and see if others can add to it, to have a more complete...Thing (resource(?)) ^_^.

Anyway, here it is (yep, it's all for now, I'm trying to find more).

CUBE: (2013-2015)

Hours: CLC's Sorn trained from 3-10 p.m (she went to an international school). Other trainees from 6-10 p.m (after school) or 1-10 p.m (no school).
So, if you don't go to school you get 9 hours of training per day, of which 4 hours are lessons and 5 practice.

Lessons:
- Fitness/Health
- Singing/Rap
- Dance
- Instruments: piano/guitar
- Language: Japanese/Chinese + English (+Korean for foreigners).
- Acting
- Speech/Good etiquette

Evaluations:
Monthly and weekly. You get missions (usually focusing on whatever is your weakness). In front of other trainees and staff.

Source: Arirang Special: CUBE Entertainment's way of training Sorn
+ Produsorn Ep.01 ( https://youtu.be/yg9IxurN3jA ).

SM: (2013-2015)

Hours: Schedule depends on your strengths and weaknesses. Usually about 2-4 hours of dance training + 2 hours of singing/rap + practice during free time= 8-10 hours if you go to school. Up to 14 if you don't.

Classes:
- Dance (choreo, sometimes learning how to design it yourself).
- Singing (music theory and just vocal training).
- Acting (mostly about situations in shows/interviews, how to act in front of camera), if you are scouted for a drama, you get different acting classes. (Not daily)
- Korean (foreigners), basic japanese/chinese. (Not daily)

Evaluations: Weekly/every 2 weeks to mark progress. You decide the concept but can consult the stylists. Also in front of other trainees and staff.

189,2018-5-24,2018,5,24,0,8lk1mi,Is JYP Entertainment really the 'nice' one?,K-PopDataGatherer,1527087698,"Out of the Big3, SM is known as the evil one, the oje that overworks idols and has many lawsuits; while JYP has a 'friendlier' image, with their sex&amp;ethics education, organic cafeteria and generally being in good terms with their artists, people (like me) find themselves thinking JYP treats people better, they're kinder and put health first (as JYP said). BUT, is it? Or am I just falling for the mediaplay of the industry?

One of the things that made me think that, is that, as I said, SM is generally pointed out as the bad one. So, when some time ago translations of pretty bad reviews on JobPlanet of the company's employees arised, people (rightfully) pointed that out. BUT if you visit that website, SM has a score of 2.5 and JYP of 2.4.
Now, I don't know korean so I don't know if their reviews are that bad, but it just made me curious.

Another thing is, even though JYP is one of the Big3, I can't find as much information about them, as from the other companies, therefore I thought perhaps I'm jumping to conclutions (JYP is nice) based on too little information.

So... I just wanted to know if you guys have information about the company, something you think proves they're not that good, or they're actually good (like, I have an idea of how much people train and what classes they take in SM and Cube but nothing about JYP)... Anyway, just wanted to know what you think (sorry I don't really know how to express myself).",8,9

26,2018-6-3,2018,6,3,16,8o6xko,Looking for people to join a KPOP DANCE TEAM!,JLynn7,1528009235,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review this ad. 

We are looking for people to join a brand new Kpop Dance Cover group. We are looking for dependable, positive like minded people who want to be part of something huge. 
ALL LEVELS ARE WELCOME!

What will the Dance team be doing?
The dance team will be doing public dance covers, dance tutorials for youtube, dancing at events and take part in whatever other potential opportunities arise. We will be dancing in public areas such as Santa Monica Pier, Koreatown, Burbank and any other areas we can go. If the opportunity arises we will dance at events like Ktown Night Markets and any other Korean related festivals or events. 

****Please note we may also learn Jpop and Cpop routines at times to perform at related events. 

What kind of songs will we be covering?
We will be covering songs from all Kpop groups including BTS, UNB, Infinite, Gfriend, Blackpink, MonstaX, AOA, APINK, Big Bang, Shinee, Super Junior, Kard, Ukiss, Vixx, Twice, Cosmic Girls and many many other groups. 

Where and when will we be practicing? 
We will be practicing twice a week at a studio in North Hollywood. Practice will be every Friday at 6pm-8:30pm. Eventually it will move to twice a week once we have enough people. (Most likely Wednesdays same time)

Why should you join?
Why shouldnt you? Honestly there are so many opportunities in a group like this. Here are some of the perks of joining!
Being surrounded by people who love what you do. 
You get to make new friends. We will be your second family!
Are you interested in auditioning for a company? Or maybe you want to get more exposure as a dancer, singer, entertainer? Well this is literally going to be free promotion for you! You will get pictures done, dance in public, and be on youtube. This is a great way to start getting people to notice you! Plus if we get people who can sing, maybe we can sing the songs and dance!
You get to learn KPOP dance routines for FREE!

Requirements. 
Age 18 and up!
Must be dependable and able to consistently attend practice! (It is insanely rude to the other dancers as well as us if you are consistently late or skip practice. It slows down everyone and makes learning a routine much harder.)
Responsible. You will be expected to practice what you learn even outside of practice. This will help to learn routines effectively.
GOOD ATTITUDE and SUPPORTIVE of your teammates. If you are going to get mad when one of your team members has trouble learning a move or have an attitude when we try to teach you then this isnt for you. We want people who will support their teammates and stay positive even when a routine looks impossible. We can do it!



Please feel free to ask any questions.If you are interested in attending please let me know as I will need to rent out a larger room depending on the amount of people who are coming. For this coming Friday (The 8th) I rented out a room for 5 people so I can take 2 more people. (Choreographer, myself and one other is already booked in.) However for future fridays, I can always book larger rooms. 

Hope to hear from you!

Cause like Chungha is really good at freestyle dance as I watched it on Produce 101.Then Lisa and Momo was known to be a good dancer since they debuted.

SO what Im wondering is who is the better one within the three of them or are they just the same ?",4,3

42,2018-6-6,2018,6,6,18,8oz881,Is 1st and 2nd generation idols irrelevant?,G00Setsuna,1528277259,"Today, internet has changed our world whether good or bad. That does include K-Pop. Once idols were recognised through hardwork and efforts. Now, only fame and popularity concern.
No fighting here, just opinions. 

Nowadays we heard a lot of K-POP from around the world. Either only heard the music to hardcore fans. K-pop has grown big and wide that there's a convention at another country besides Korea. Throughout K-pop history, there was amazing recognition to terrible news. We stand as we all watch and grown to our own favourite group/solo artist. Therefore here we are the K-pop community.

Throughout the old days of K-pop, the genre itself is hard to be recognised by the Korea citizens. The idols need to work hard to be recognised by the community. Their hardships are unknown to us until they speak it up. Some goes up and some goes down. Some even went to certain degree of scandal for the purpose of surviving the entertainment industry.

I've grown in 2nd generation of K-pop. I've seen alot of good and bad things in K-pop world. Those were the days where the K-pop were rising. 
Now days, only fame and recognition were matter. Days and nights is like a battlefield to see who has the most views, likes, followers, trophies and etc. The saddest thing is how the 2nd and 1st generation idols were discarded from current generation as 'Grandfather' or 'Grandmother'. 

How broken my heart as I hear those words. How could you say those who raised your idols to this very day. It saddens me but make me realize that the world is changing in increasing rate.

What about your opinion? Is it ok for the way it is?",4,1

So straight to the point: I want to make an Asian music group. Now not because I have something against people of other races or anything, I just want to make a music group that represents all (or at least most) of Asia. Now, what do I mean by that? There are so many groups (like Idol groups for example) that are more based in 1 country, but I want to make a group with members from different countries. A couple of inspirations for me to start all this are:

Groups:
Brockhampton (American hip-hop boyband that met on the internet), A huge number of Asian idol groups and 88rising (although that's more of a company)
Solo artists (that personally inspire the music I want to make):
Bruno Mars, Zico (specifically his song ""Artist"") and Rude-

What kind of genre music? Any kind! I think we could be held back if we only stick to 1 genre and sound, and definitely at the beginning we should experiment a lot. 
I'm not incredibly musically gifted but I'm currently learning to produce and I can write songs and I'm practicing rap (still finding my ""rap voice"").
I'm decent at graphic design, film, editing and animation(mostly after effects stuff).
I'm half Indonesian and half European, I can speak Dutch, English and learning Indonesian.

With the music I think we can include both English and other languages in 1 song for example: a song with English/Chinese/Korean or something like that, I don't know a lot of groups that do that and I think we could be unique in that.
I have a lot of Ideas on how the group could work. Personally I would like it to be a more rougher version of an Idol group (Mix between for example BTS and Brockhampton).

What kind of people do we need? Vocalists, Rappers, Producers, Other things music related (people that play instruments, songwriters or maybe a manager), Dancers (preferably also interested in being a vocalist or rapper) and graphic design.
When it comes to visuals it's not really that important to me, but if you think you qualify as a visual and are interested in making music you're welcome!
Don't want to be limited to being just a boy or girl group, both are invited.

For the people that aren't Asian. I'm also thinking about maybe splitting the group into ""west"" and ""east"" groups, so you're still welcome to come and hang out and talk about music.

I created a Discord server for people that are interested:

Please feel free to correct me, add more features, or locations similar to SM as I did limited research beforehand.

  
On that note, I think it would be really cool to implement:

* old music video sets being replicated (such as the clothing shop in SNSD's Gee) where people can walk around and takes pictures in 
* interactive props used in MVs (such as the black car in SHINee's Ring Ding Dong and Red Velvet's Automatic \+ the red curtains in Boyfriend's Witch) 
* MORE iconic outfits (such as Oh My Girl's Windy Day, 4minute's Crazy, and Red Velvet's Bad Boy)
* k\-pop jukeboxes 
* a gallery featuring notable concepts (\*coughs\* VIXX)
* workshops on replicating makeup looks
* LIGHTSTICKS interactive display 
* photocard gallery w/ front and back display by group
* rainbow gallery consisting of albums 

Although it is unrealistic to implement all of ideas listed above, I definitely believe that other companies can pursue their own ""museum"" like SM did to some degree or at least compile some their items (signed albums, old stage/MV outfits, and merchandise) for public display. Ideally I would like to have a true k\-pop museum consisting of items from the entire k\-pop industry but I understand that acquiring everything and keeping up with maintenance costs is difficult.

I asked the community of which track from 2018 I should give a remix,

and many asked for Love Scenario by iKON.

Super  awesome track, I felt in love with it immediately and started working  on it. The track reminded me of a track i made back in 2002. Thats why I  combined the melody from the track with this.

Thank you all for being so kind and suggest tracks, I hope More will suggest some ideas and tracks to remix!

If anyone can give any information about this, seriously i need your help!

I was planning on making my own cards like you would get in albums. But there are so many great photos that I would have too many of them. I felt it would be easier to just put them all in a book that I could rearrange myself. Thought I'd share a few pages if anyone wants to take a look.

https://imgur.com/a/gYzKFMA

This 1st book is only using photos from 2016, since my page limit was only 110. I tried to rearrange all the photos by date but with so many resources, the original dates of some were probably off a little. I was able to cover their profiles, some pre-debut photos, photos of their music videos, some of their photoshoots for magazines, and as many selfies of them I could find. I do plan on making my own book(s) again for 2017 all the way to their mini album release.",1,1

In the article it says ""*teams of women who have had the most impact on the K-pop industry over the past decade*"". It was published last year.

So the list goes as follows:

10. miss A

9. Apink

8. 4minute

7. f(x)

6. Kara

5. After School and subunit Orange 
Caramel

4. Brown Eyed Girls

3. Wonder Girls

2. 2NE1

1. Girl's Generation

Now i don't follow the entire kpop scene, just some artists so I can't gauge myself if this is accurate. What do you think? You can read the article here:

The group currently consists of 23 members from the USA, The Philippines, Canada, Afghanistan, and multiple other countries. Of those 23 members, about 10 are active on a daily basis. Mostly everyone in the GroupMe favors BlackPink above all other groups, but we still love plenty of other Kpop as well (Red Velvet and Twice are pretty popular amongst us). Ages in the chat range from 16-29, but we are currently only accepting 18+ members.

Do to the nature of such a diverse group of people, we have culminated a very welcoming community of open minded individuals. We dont judge each other, and we love to learn about our differences and similarities through social media and the one thing that ultimately unites us: Kpop.

We have been a community for almost a year now, and we talk on a daily basis. Recently however the group hasnt been as active, and we are looking to shake it up by adding new members. Please keep in mind that this group contains many different personalities. Because of this, our only requirement is that you are respectful and do your best to keep an open mind.

I am working on a fan page/website and I hope I can get some advice from you. :)

The website is not fully finished yet but I'm uploading new content every week. (New memes, fan fiction, fan art and Korean study materials with BTS songs etc) Also, I used to teach Korean in Australia, and I thought I can make some Korean study materials with BTS content. What would you like to learn? Korean culture, dialect, idioms?

Any comments about the website are appreciated. About its layout, design, content etc. I hope this post is okay here, thanks a lot !

I think Pledis could be using P48 as a stepping stone of possibly reviving the AS brand with KaEun at the forefront and the possibility of also adding Yun-Jin also - although I do wonder why they'd need p48? I assume the popularity in Korea has died unlike the popularity internationally perhaps? 

Who have we got left in AS?
Raina, Nana, E-young and KaEun

Now I could be very wrong but I feel like this could be a fun discussion to have!

209,2018-07-28,2018,7,28,11,92iok2,Monthly K-Pop/R&amp;B Series,ohmizu,1532744732,"So I run a music database called Musictea, and I'm starting a YouTube channel for it. :D I'm starting with a monthly K-Pop/R&amp;B series, where I'll make a playlist, with a video showing the songs in that month's list.

I started with January, and I know that was a while ago, but figuring out what exactly I want this series to be and getting it all organized was very time-consuming (also there were difficulties in my personal life). At the moment I'm working to get caught up, then I plan on releasing these a month or so after their featured month (ex: I'd release July's playlist/video in September). I don't want to worry about anything trendy or charts; I want to make a quality series that would be worth watching 5 years later.

**The Playlist:**

I completely ignored charts. Basically I listened to a shitton of music, weeded out the crap, and slowly narrowed it down to what I feel are strong songs. I tried to be objective/unbiased, and include a good variety. I want to showcase everything the genre has to offer. :)

**The Video:**

This is the first video I've ever made!!! :D I would greatly appreciate feedback and constructive criticism.

The purpose of the video is, for one, they're fun to watch. :p Two, it's for people who want to see what music is out there but don't have time to listen to an entire playlist. I'm also really hoping it'll help smaller artists get more exposure.

**The Author:**

In case anyone's wondering who tf made this.. I'm a late 20s nerd, been in love with music for 17 years. I'll listen to almost anything, from K-Pop to Black Metal.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVKFijb1MAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVKFijb1MAI)

I hope you guys like this! I've worked really hard to make it. Once the K-Pop series is caught up, I'm going to start a monthly Korean rock/folk series (starting from January because I'm stubborn lol).

\---

Also, I almost have February's video finished. I'll be uploading it within a few days and I'll post it here!",0,5

\*Umji and Kyla are queens

\*JYP needs to give 25% of Nayeons lines to Jeongyeon

\*Momo should sing with her original voice

\*Being underrated and underappreciated are two different things, people call groups underrated too much

\*If BlackPink did have a leader it would most definitely be Jennie

\*Companies need to stop debuting idols at the age of 13 and 14

\*While I do fuck with NCT heavy I feel like SM ifs gonna fuck them over with the infinite members thing.

\*Out of all of the groups in kpop somebody has gotta be gay

\*85% of people that react to kpop songs only do it to make money (all shade) and dont give a rats ass about the kpop community or genre

\*SEVENTEENs softer concept was a smart move, but my china line boys still need lines (not just adlibs)

\*WJSNs line distribution is one of the worst in kpop

\*Most people only appreciate Wonhos body, not his talent

\*CLC is underappreciated af and Liar is a bop

\*Smut about animals/hybrids is weird as hell....

\*Kpop fans arent as problematic as people say, people say ignorant shit and try to play victim

\*People who write/read smut of minors shall burn in hell

\*When people said that Nayeon was TWICEs fake maknae I saw surprised because Chaeyoung seems more like shed be the fake maknae

\*I prefer TWICE's sidetracks better than their title tracks (woohoo, eyes eyes eyes, next page, ect)

\*TWICE needs more rap parts than just 10 seconds that gets split up for two rappers

\*Idols shouldnt be allowed to perform in the rain (one day someones gonna get an extreme injury)

\*Ahin of Momoland needs more lines

\*Out of the big 3 JYP is the best and SM is the worst

\*If Hani were to ever leave EXID shed be an amazing mc

\*SEVENTEEN is top 3 when it comes to variety (with DK, Seungkwan, and Hoshi)

\*Crack videos arent that funny to me

\*Signal was not trash

\*Companies need to stop giving groups sexy concepts if theres still minors in the group

\*Weekly Idol&gt;&gt;&gt;Idol Room

\*Seeing an idol doing aegyo is cringy asf especially if they do it for no reason",1,0

I entered a competition that my work, Starbucks created with Spotify. Starbucks partners have to come up with the best summer playlist. The two most followed playlists by August 11 win the top prizes which is having their playlist played in 8000+ Starbucks stores! I really really want this. K-pop is my love. I want to show it off to the world, especially on the job, lol. I spent hours curating a really fun summer playlist, one that will appeal to non listeners of K-pop. Theyll never know whats coming to them! Theyll get hooked! I have Western pop and EDM songs for variety. I would really appreciate if you followed my playlist. I really only hear K-pop at boba shops and at Korean restaurants and I just think it would be wonderful if K-pop was more public. Imagine we would be seeing K-pop in more places.  Probably K-pop stores would start opening up. Its just a start. Im in desperate need of more followers, so please follow and share! Thank you!

They as well according to multiple websites have been getting death threats. So to stop this petition it would be really nice if people who have twitter to tweet or any social media about the situation and show your support with the following hashtags:
#HereforPentagon
#EdawnandHyunaGotMySupport

It would be really nice as both of these wonderful people actually are staying true to fans and have admitted about the relationship. Hyuna has found someone she has generally liked and both love each other.

(Also please dont delete my post Im just trying to bring awareness and moderators keep deleting so!)

Anyway thats my news for the day! ",10,16

144,2018-8-17,2018,8,17,6,97wh9w,Currently looking for people to help create an unofficial Kpop set for Cards Against Humanity~!,MeepsNcheese,1534455826,"Do you play Cards Against Humanity? 

Do you love kpop? 

Do you want to put them together? 


Join our team today! We're looking for writers to help us compile a basic card deck for Cards Against Humanity - Kpop Edition! As long as you can crack jokes and put them down on paper, we'd love to have you! Every fandom is welcome - after all, no group is exempt from the (probably) roasting. If you're interested, pop us (either /u/Sowon_Impersonator or I) a message and we'll get crackin!

In case you don't now what CAH is, here's a little spiel written by /u/Sowon_Impersonator \^^:

CAH is a game played by 3+ people. Each person has a hand of white cards, and can draw one every round. Every round, one person picks a black card with a question or fill in the blank statement on it, and the other people must present a white card from their hand that answers the question or fills in the blank. Whoever drew the black card gets to pick the funniest answer, and the person with the funniest answer gets a point. This continues until a point limit is reached, which you can set yourself.

A few examples just so folks get the gist of some black prompt cards and white answer cards:

&gt;[BREAKING] SM's new girl's group concept rumored to be __.

&gt;Monkeys allergic to bananas getting around their allergy by drinking milk

&gt;Heechul in a wig doing girl group dances

&gt;Cheesu Kimbap

&gt;[AMAZING] This year's ISAC will feature the new sport of __.

&gt;Idols dating other idols

&gt;Running through an airport with sasaeng fans chasing you

&gt;Telling yourself ""Krystal's hair in Nu Abo wasn't thaaat bad"" out of pure desperation""",4,21

So music, concert ticket sales, merch, awards... gone.  Overnight. And they can't release anything new. She also makes it so that nobody can become a trainee at these companies and forces every single existing trainee to leave. The remaining artists keep promoting. That's the way it is for three years until someone defeats the witch and everything goes back, the groups that disappeared have their status reinstated and things go back to the way they were. If the company's still there, of course.
My question is: how fucked is your bias group's company? Does your bias group still exist? What consequences do you think this would bring?

Like the only songs that I listen to from BTS are their main, title tracks, like DNA, Fake Love, Blood Sweat and Tears, etc. But I actually died when I heard this song. Who knew how good Jimin's vocals were? Like WTF. Anyways, slight spoiler, but this song earned like the third ever perfect rating from me, and the other two were from Blackpink which I absolutely love. Anyways, if you could check out the review, that'd be AWESOME. This subreddit has been super supportive and the content you guys make is incredible.

Check out my thoughts here: [https://justintalksmedia.blogspot.com/2018/08/kpop-83118-serendipity-full-length-by.html](https://justintalksmedia.blogspot.com/2018/08/kpop-83118-serendipity-full-length-by.html)

Also, because I can only self-promote once a week (but I post like 3-4 times a week), it'd be awesome if you gave me a quick follow on twitter here: [https://twitter.com/justintalkmedia](https://twitter.com/justintalkmedia) . It only takes like five seconds and you can stay updated on my posts, and it would mean a TON to me. My user is @justintalkmedia if you just wanna search me up.

My initial reaction was: ""Oh cool, they modified black on black and used it for this!"". Then I noticed that there were less than 18 people on the stage, and that EXO was singing a rock version of MAMA, a song released in 2012.

After checking the date on the video, which is December of 2016, I realized that before releasing Black on Black, NCT must have been practicing it for at least a year and a half!

Today I was watching [Classical Musicians React to Stellar and Kevin explained the last chorus perfectly](https://youtu.be/yUXOWGHaTB8?t=4m53s): they changed a minor 3rd to a major 3rd! The world makes sense now!

My name Khoi, I'm a College student looking for other people's opinions on how K-Pop came to be 
I'm doing this for an assignment that I have, so any help or ideas will be greatly appreciated.

My 3 thesis statement are: 1.How K-Pop transform from a traditional Korean music to what we know today, 2.How did K-Pop gain it's popularity (i.e: Gangnam style,...etc), 3.How it's gaining more popularity as of now and in the future

But yeah, If you would kindly write down how you guys know about K-Pop, How did your friends came to known it, or just input on what you have that related to those 3 statement I would really adore you.

I really like how Kpop is (business wise in this sense) and really want to know if the USA or any western counties can emulate what the Kpop companies are doing without necessarily totally copying it?

First thing he notices is Tons of messages on his phone from his friends. All of them are telling him that E'Dawn and Hyuna have been kicked from Cube. He doesn't believe it. He opens Reddit, his primary source of News, and sees the post. Reading through the Comments he realizes that it is not fake and that they have actually been kicked. Him being a 200 IQ Genius he realizes that this will cause Cube to go Bankrupt, which would be devastating for all of his Friends. His fellow Pentagon members, [G]-Idle and CLC, their carriers would all be ruined. He cant let that happen. He reads the time of the post on Reddit, ""5 hours ago"". There isn't much time. But it isn't too late yet. He grabs his Resignation Papers which he had already prepared weeks ago, knowing this moment would come sooner or later. He gets dressed and takes a cab to Cube Entertainment headquarters. He arrives at the front door entrance. As time is of highest importance he doesn't bother going around to the Employee entrance at the back, and just rushes in the front door. Him being Hui the security let him through to the Elevator without any questions. He Presses the top Butten in the Elevator, Floor 25. This is Park Choon-Min's Office floor. The Elevator arrives at the top. Hui rushes out and bursts open the Bosses door without knocking. Park Choon-Min is sitting at his desk with a live graph of the Cube Ent. Stock on a screen in front of him. Its pointing down. Hui slams the resignation Papers on his desk. ""Bring them back or I leave!"" Hui screams, ""You know that if I leave your Company is doomed to go Bankrupt! You have no choice!"" Park Choon-Min stands up from his desk and walks over to Hui. ""Hui, you can't do this to us! We practically raised you!"" Park Choon-Min says with a loud but scared voice. ""NO, you don't do this to us. We carried you! We brought this company to where it is now!"" Park Choon-Min sits back down at his desk. Looks at the Graph of Cube Ent. and whispers: ""Okay god dam it, Ill bring them back."" Hui turns around. ""There we go! Enjoy floor 25 while it's still yours."" Hui says with a calm voice. He walks back to the Elevator with a smirk on his face. Because he knows, who the real boss of Cube is.",0,0

Hi everyone!

Recently two of my fellow Ahgase friends &amp; I made a GOT7 Discord server for fans to meet, chat, and chill out. We are currently small but very friendly, and we welcome everyone! [**Click here**](https://discord.gg/Gr37D3t) **if you would like to join.** Lets chat about the comeback (dropping in less than 2 days)!

In case youre not familiar with Discord, its an app for text and voice chatting. It allows ppl to easily share photos, videos, gifs, etc.

In our server we have:

* a bot that notifies us whenever GOT7s VLive, YouTube, and Insta accounts update
* a music bot
* self-assignable bias roles
* individual member channels
* a memes channel

P.S. Credits for the art go to [@marbledcoffee](https://twitter.com/marbledcoffee) on Twitter (One of my friends that started the server with me)",0,5

The Characters are mbased on fandom names, colours, and interactions ets. With a little sprinkle of lyrics from some group songs. This is very limited (only 5 fandoms) but i think it would be really cool if others made similar puzzles about other fandoms .

Here goes:


..........A......... is a tall, lean, blond boy with shoulder length hair that's normally in a ponytail. Has a thing for soft pastel colours which is obvious in his choice of clothes. He's rather gentle, soft and uwu at times. Really easygoing with only few enemies. His girlfriend is A smol goth-rocker chick called - ........B......... 

This Pink-haired girl and .......A....... have known each other for a long time (they were born in the same hospital, in the same month), but only recently started dating during the summer. Sometimes she's misunderstood by others but ........A........ has almost always been there to explain and clear things up. 

They're both sophomores now and not many people know of their relationship yet. 


They have a third friend called ........C........ She's got green eyes and is a bold and nice older friend to the two of them. 

But the thing is, somethings up with ..........A......... Recently, a Freshmen has caught his eye. 

........D.......... another smol girl who always smells like cherries and limes. She's can also be a crazy little bomb at times. ..........A.......... periodically finds his eyes straying towards her. Does he think of cheating? No. 
But she has his attention and he feels very supportive towards her. Her older brother ........E....... was very nice to him before graduating last year.

But then again, he's a nice guy, who sometimes makes others peoblems his own, and this worries .......C....... Sometimes. Because due to this niceness, .......B....... is showing some signs of Jealousy. She doesn't want him talking to other people. 


Someone has a crush on .......D....... Nobody knows. But she's like a flower to him. And he feels like a loser around her.

It just struck me that most Maknaes seem to find it hard to socialise in school and that just makes me sad for some reason. 

These babies never have friends within their peer groups.  Ever. And it seems the younger the debut age the worse it is. Worse still is when the maknae is the only one in his/her age line in their group. 

Then again, I'm sure they do make good friends within the group eventually. But during the initial years, there might still be a bit of formality and loneliness. 

Or am I wrong and do I only know of those having/that had problems socializing? 

Edit: It's just that I undeestand how awkward it can be sometimes and they dont really have a chance to get past that quickly due to their busy schedule and status.

Edit 2 (sorry): The foreigners probably have it worse. ",1,2

**""Distance"" by CLC** 

I have to admit that at the first listen of the Black Dress album I loved the title song just a bit more than this B side track. However I probably played ""Black Dress a bit too much, and my interest for the song just wasn't there anymore. Since that happened this song has become my favorite song on the album. To be honest I never thought that the song would ever get a music video, but it did and it's really well produced. The whole mature concept for this song is something I would like to see more within the industry, and it seems to suit the girls really well. Another thing to add is that this song reminds me of their previous song ""Where are You ?"".

**""Secret Garden"" by Oh My Girl**

Oh My Girl is one of my new absolute favorite girl groups out there right now because their vocals just know how to make me feel calm. When I saw that this song was among the few that were released early this year I knew that this year was going to be great for Kpop as a whole. It's has been over 5 months ago since the song came out, and I still love playing it over and over again. I think the reason why this is their best title track yet is the fact that there is not a rap anywhere to be found in the song. A song doesn't necessarily need a rap for it to be good and this is great example of that statement.

**""Paint Me"" by Mamamoo**

In my personal opinion I always believed that these girls were always great from the start of their carrer, but of course not everyone sees them that way. For those whose are concerned about the controversy they are known for I'm fully aware of it. I don't condone them for what they did but I still enjoy their music along with fully knowing that they are capable of learning their lesson. Anyways back to mentioning the song, I like what they are doing with their image. For the lonest time most of the songs they did had a retro vibe to it and I loved that they had made that apart of their whole concept. However, I respect their choice to change their image and branch out to other concepts and genres. This song is a great start for a new beginning for the group and I fully believe that their carrer will continue to be successful.

**""Good Evening"" &amp; ""I Want You"" by SHINee**

I have been a fan of several groups over the last 6 years, but my love for SHINee has always been consistent. Every single song that they ever produced was outstanding in my eyes making me believe that these men could never do anything wrong. When Jonghyun committed suicide last year a part of me was feeling that they would go on a long hiatus in order to recover from the tragic loss of their fellow group member. Despite losing an angel, they probably felt the best way to honor their friend was to keep on singing even though he was no longer with them physically. When I heard that SHINee was going to have a comeback in late May I was super excited. The music video finally released and I was pleased once again with their amazing vocals. At first I thought that was the only song they were going to come out with but then they dropped their second mini album for the year only a few weeks later. However that is not the end of it because they are going to release part 3 really soon. Both main title tracks from part 1 &amp; 2 are complete jams and I cant get enough of either song. Of course these guys really know how to adapt to the current sound because both songs suit them so well and doesn't make it seem like they are trying hard. 

**""Only One You Need"" by Jonghyun**

The fact that SM Entertainment still released Jonghyun's last album is really touching. Jonghyun meant a lot to so many people especially to his fellow group members. Among all of the members he surely did have a unique voice which lead him to have a successful solo carrer separate to his carrer with SHINee. It was sad to hear that he left us but this entire album was like a big thank you for all the fans supporting his work. I picked this song in particular because of the lyrics ""I wanna be the only one you need"". Songs like ""Shinin"" and ""Before Our Spring"" of course are dedicated Shawols in general but this song is more dedicated to Shawols individually. 

**""Lazy"" by EXO-CBX** 

To be completely honest I am not the biggest fan of EXO as a whole but for some reason I am a big fan of the sub unit EXO-CBX. The main reason why I love the sub unit so much is that my bias from the group, Xiumin, has more opportunities to shine and show off his voice. EXO is an amazing in their own right but I am so glad that SM decided to create the subunit. With their new mini album I think it's unique how each of the songs are themed around each day of the week. This song in particular is mentioning about a Lazy Sunday and how being ""simple is sexy baby woah"". In general this song is so relaxing and peaceful and I have to say this is the best song on the album.

**""One Shot Two Shot"" by BoA** 

People seem to be always contemplating who the real Queen(s) of Kpop is/are. Some people say that is Twice, 2NE1, IU, or Ailee, but in my opinion I believe the real queen of the genre is BoA. She has been in the industry for over 15 years and officially started her carrer in 2001. Now I like the other artists that I mentioned however she just has a special place in my heart as a solo artist. I always found her music to be so upbeat that it makes me wanna dance to it. This song was no exception because the background music is so much fun to listen to, and when I watched the music video it made me want to learn the choreography.

**""Go Away"" by Jun Hyung Yong**

Highlight is another group that I don't really stan but I don't mind their music every once in a while. Despite the fact I actually don't mind some of the members individually like Junhyung or Yoseob. This song truly introduced me to his voice and made me recognize how unique his voice is on his own. Overall the song is relatable and the lyrics portray the scenario about two people falling out of love accurately. Unfortunately this kind of situation happens sometimes, and it's good to have a songs to represent that. I think that having it be a upbeat kind of song helps give it a more positive outlook in general. 

**""Selfish"" by Moonbyul &amp; Seulgi**

When I heard that a couple of the members of Mamamoo were going to branch off and kickstart their solo careers I was completely ecstatic. Honestly I didn't expect Moonbyul to get a solo mini album because most people seem to talk about the other three girls more. Another thing I was excited to hear was that Seulgi from Red Velvet was going to be featured in the title track. I think this choice was pretty outstanding not only because she is really popular with in the fandom but also have a general interest with each other's music. Not to mention the music video is super cute and funny and it really shows how close they are as friends.

**""No More"" by UNI.T**

Where do I begin with this song? The way I found out about the song was on one of Kville Entertainment's videos. I honestly did not think I was going to like this song as much as I do. At first it sounds just like another average sexy concept song but after a couple of listens my opinion changed very quickly. Now every time I hear this song I automatically put it on repeat and can't get enough of it because of the killer vocals. Not every debut is unique and super special but I have to say this is an outstanding debut song for an underrated group. It's a shame that these girls have not been brought up in conversation within the Kpop community a whole lot because they are really talented with the potential to go big. 

**""Lost in the Dream"" by Monsta X** 

As much as I love title songs it often seems that a majority of the B side tracks are better. When Monsta X released this album I wasn't automatically sold on it because I didnt really like Jealousy. But of course I never like to judge an album just solely on the main song they decide to produce a music video for. This song stands out the most on the album because it sounds darker than a lot of other songs they recorded. I mean the intensity of the music alone really helps sets the feeling for this song but when it's paired the passionate vocals of the members it just becomes 10 times better. 

**""Jenga"" by Heize**

For the longest time I never really payed attention to Heize because her music never really suited my taste. Somehow I just watched the music video and I instantly liked it because the concept was really cool. The song sounds like something you would hear in an old timey jazz club which I think is such an underrated concept. Also in general this is one of those songs that you can listen too when you are trying to relax because her vocals are soft and peaceful. Now I am not 100% certain if I am going to stan her but if she makes more songs like this it's very likely that I will.

**""Love4eva"" by LOONA**

A lot of people of think that I only listen to Kpop but I still listen to Western artists, and one of those artists is Grimes. Her style of music is so eclectic and unique which is the main why I love her so much. Then the announcement came out that she was going to collaborate with Loona and I was suddenly overwhelmed. I couldn't have asked for anything better because this song is so outstanding and everything works so well. Honestly the techno music suits this specific sub unit of Loona and if one of the other two did the same thing it probably wouldn't work in my opinion.

**""Alone"" by Black6ix** 

Ever since I saw the music video for the song ""Like a Flower"" I just was hooked on this group's music. They just debuted last year and they have 3 absolutely catchy title songs which need more appreciation. I've still yet to know all of their names but I can definitely tell there is a great amount of talent present. This song is a little different than the other two songs they are known for but it still a pure joy to listen to. Even though it is not really an official ballad it's a nice change to have a softer song in their collection. However there is only one thing that didn't really suit this comeback and that was the music video itself. It wasn't terrible but the production could have a lot better. Anyways if you going to give this song a chance listen to the song without the mv.

**""Scentist"" by VIXX**

My list wouldnt be complete without adding a song from the Concept Kings themselves. I always look forward to seeing what their next comeback will bring because I know I won't be disappointed with any concept they choose to do. This comeback along with last year's might have not been necessarily dark or edgy but it's because of their versatility that they earned their current title. What I like most about this concept is that they are portraying themselves as Aromachologists (googled this term) in order to recreate the beautiful scent that they experienced while meeting a lovely lady. 

**""Baby"" by The Rose**

K-Rock is a genre that I don't dwell upon that often because for the longest time I just had no interest in it. That all changed when I discovered CNBLUE and my curiosity peaked for the genre. However they were the real K band that I cared about for a while until I discovered the boys from The Rose. Something about them reminded me about CNBLUE and I decided to see where they would go with their carrer. I am not fully apart of the fandom yet but if they keep impressing me like with this song I know I will become a loyal fan. One random part of the song that a lot of people seem to like that I also enjoy is where one of the members sings the lyrics ""Clouds are shrouding us into the dark"". Those lyrics are sung so beautifully that is what sold it for me. 

**""Broken"" by TVXQ**

I really can't help but mention the two gentlemen that make up this group because they are legendary. Since they both had been out of the military for some time I had really been looking forward for them to have a comeback and they definitely killed it. This non title track stood out to me because it's one of many songs that talk about the harsh reality of love. Love is not an easy thing to experience and songs like this need to exist because it's necessary to recognize both the good and bad. Even though the lyrics are really sad the melody is still really beautiful. Something ironic to note about this song is its placement after the track ""The Chance of Love"" which is an upbeat positive song.

**""You &amp; I"" by Dreancatcher**

Since I have been giving K-rock more of a chance these last few years I always wondered about a girl group who could be considered apart of the genre. Then Dreamcatcher debuted with their killer vocals and outstanding eerie concept. Unlike most K-bands these girls actually dance, and there is nothing wrong with that. To me this is their best song yet and is the song that introduced me to them. The way this song plays into their eerie concept is that the other girls are trying to rescue their fellow member from an evil spirit. Once the spirit has been released all of the girls are being chased by said spirit and are trying so hard to escape its presence. I personally love these darker story for music videos because it is a good change.

**""The Reason"" by Got7**

With Got7 being one of my of ultimate bias groups they hardly ever let me down when it comes down to their music. Despite this fact, I am going to say the truth by saying that this last album was not their strongest album. I still enjoy listening to it though because there are a few songs that make it worth listening to. This is the 3rd track on the album and being completely honest it's the best song. I love how you can tell each individual's passion when they're singing along with the emotional lyrics. Even though there is a little rap within the song it does not take away from the meaning the song portrays. ",3,22

That you wonder how nobody talks about thay thing about that idol. Here are some of mine:

Pristin V - Eunwoo girly/nice voice

CLC - Seungyeon Jumps out the most for me

Gfriend - Umji sweet voice/unique looking

Dreamcatcher - Gahyeon Her voice adds an extra aspect to each their songs

Blackpink - Ros she just puts something extra in her dance moves and voice (not that ""irritating pitch"" bit just extra effects or something) that really makes you feel the song

When I was  younger I was listening a lot kpop songs. There is one song I really want hear again but I forgot the name of it. I think it is from 2013/2014 but I am not sure.

I remember the song is sung by a solo female korean artist who are not that famous. 

She has a very powerful voice and then I remember that you see her singing in a band in the video. And then you see a man in another clip where the man is running and seems to be a kind of scared because he gets shout down a lot by a lot of shouts. In the clip with the man the sun is shining and he running around outside.

in the clip with the female singer, she is inside singing in a band and I also remember some deer horns in background on the wall lol. 

I no it is properly hard to help but I really that someone knows what I am talking about.

Thanks anyways! :)",0,1

hi there! i recently wrote an article regarding NCT 127's most recent comeback: regular-irregular. as the title implies, the article is mostly about how NCT 127 are breaking into the american music industry (and how they're trying to achieve the same success BTS have in america).

**i'd love it if you'd give it a read,** [link is here!](https://lqy2002.tumblr.com/post/179046805869/how-nct-127-are-breaking-into-the-american-music) i'd also love to hear feedback! this is my first time posting an article of mine online; all criticism and discussion are welcome. (\`)",10,1

I am Korean, and I have signed up for this site to help you guys learn Koreans through the comments.

Also, I have started a youtube channel for learning Korean, so I need everyone's support to make myself motivated on creating better contents. **2 days ago,** I made a video about learning korean with K-POP. (Winner - Really Really).

But **Very Important! (For those who ask ""is it successful to learn Korean with K-POP)**

*Please be advised learning Korean ONLY by K-POP is not desirable. I recommend using a variety of sources to learn Korean. BUT still I promise I will do my best to guide you in the right direction by using K-POP as the learning source.*

*I always hope my channel can make your learning Korean easier and faster, and I am a person who feels responsible for producing good quality video. Please have a visit, let me guide your journey to Korean!! Below is the link.*

I remember one time during a seventeen radio  interview (if someone could provide the link to it I would really appreciate it) which I came across when I just became a carat. The interviewer asked the boys (I think this must've been an earlier interview, not too far from when the boys just debuted) how long they envisioned their first kisses would be: 

(Nb - the following isn't verbatim)

Boo: about five minutes

Seok: about five seconds, because it would be awkward at first, then probably go in for a second one. Aahh, Hoshi hyung seems to really like this question. 

Soon : ... (You can hear the giddy giggles as he replies) I'd just keep going.

Another time, I think this was on AfreecaTV? When they were asking how many kids the boys wanted and S.coups mentioned about 4 I think (I think he wanted more girls too) and the members were like oh wow, are you sure you can handle that? 

SeungCheol - I can handle 12 of you, you think I can't handle 4 kids? 

I'm thinking it's in the same Video, the question is directed to Hoshi (someone correct me if I'm wrong). 

Hoshi ^An ^Intellectual : I'll just keep going/working hard. 

(When I watched these videos my korean was worse than it is now and I was a fairly new carat so I'm going wholly on what I remember from english subs - so please correct me if I'm wrong) 

Edit - 

A few others: 
- Dokyeom's predebut ""Two-teen"" instead of Twenty and Mingyu's ""I love guys."" 

(The funny thing is how Esther - the first carat that vernon was teaching english too has gone on to say ""Three-teen"" and also put ""I love guys"" in one of her videos. 

- Chenle, when he was talking how his dad asked his mom to have another kid after so long

There's also each group's unique outlook, which is deftly woven into their songs-B1A4's personal philosophy draws heavily from blood types, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Kpop truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth of the existential catchphrase ""Ring ding dong ring ding dong ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as my genius wit unfolds itself on their phones and computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.  

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Super Junior tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",0,1

As I got up there, NCT's ""Chain"" came on, and the person taking my money started dancing, and was like, ""That's LIT!""

An interview with the manager of the upcoming kpop duo.",Randummonkey,1540977348,"I was bored and wrote an Onion-style news article about [this group](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/10/dm-entertainment-to-debut-a-new-girl-group-sad).

&amp;nbsp;

A new entrant into the world of Kpop is attracting attention with a peculiar name for their new group. A company by the name of DM Entertainment announced plans to debut a kpop duo this winter under the name SaD"". DM Entertainment joined the industry last year with the debut of 2-member group, Limesoda. Many industry analysts and insiders expressed concern over the plethora of other groups that have already debuted in 2018. How could a small upstart hope to compete against the likes of CUBE Entertainment and their newest girl group, (G)I-dle? 

DM Entertainment has stated that they intend to use a groundbreaking social media branding strategy focusing on a unique group name. Not to be outdone by the likes of (G)I-dle, DM Entertainment concocted a name that is both shorter and slightly more confusing than the fellow rookie group. 

When asked why they would use such a name, a DM Entertainment manager responded by stating:

""It is our belief that in the age of social media, quirky names are a must. Look at Mamamoo, Momoland, and Bulletproof Boy Scouts (BTS). Of course, we needed something to stand out. So we asked ourselves what name could confuse twitter followers more than (G)I-dle. After a long and rigorous process, we landed on 'SaD' and are quite happy with the result.""

Upon being asked whether he believed the name would help on social media, the manager replied by stating:

To be honest, I also had some early concerns about the name. However, the uniqueness and brevity of the name have turned out to be a stroke of genius. My market analysts have told me that the group is already trending globally on Twitter. It turns out that people all over the world are already using #SaD. I was personally surprised to find that millions of people used our hashtag before the groups name was even announced. Now thats what I call fantastic marketing!

The company manager concluded the interview by stating that they were quite confident in SaD's potential and hoped that they would not disappoint their legions of global fans with their debut.

https://vocaroo.com/i/s1WlDXs0JAPi


I've been so incredibly obsessed with this song since the day it came out. I wanted to get into mixing and synths and figured I'd start with a challenge. I watched the Genius video on making the track to see the tabs and instruments. I even bought sylenth1 and the weird French pre-made settings (w/ delay turned down a bit like the actual song). The bass isn't right, but I don't have $300 to drop on Trilian rn. I have like 0 drum kits and couldn't find a suitable kick at all // don't have the loop they used so that's probably the worst part. 


Anyways I play guitar idk what I'm doing, but I had fun starting this adventure and thought maybe someone would enjoy knowing my go-to project was a kpop song.",2,1

This came to my head while watching Blackpink videos, normal Blink thing to do. But this thought occurred to me while looking at fancams and reading comments....

So, everyone knows, Jennie recently released her solo debut titled SOLO and [she won #1 at Inkigayo](https://youtu.be/smimdoBjeAE) which is fine; she worked hard for it. Obviously its her FIRST solo stage so shes very energetic and whatnot but theres something I noticed, and from the comments Im not the only one.

[Jennie doesnt have that same energy with BP.](https://youtu.be/zPujZqQr8Bg)

There are lots of videos online of Jennie being low energy, or lazy, on stage with her bandmates and its so unfair to them because you can tell the other ladies are working their a** off. 

So here is my conspiracy; does Jennie want to be solo instead of with BP?

Obviously Jennie loves her bandmates, theres no doubt, but comparing her effort in group and solo its a big difference. And I know Jennies song is about being single and happy and empowered, but is this also a hint at wanting to be solo? 

Jennie knows YG and Teddy love her. And maybe thats why shes putting in low effort, knowing nothing will happen. Its known that Jennie is known throughout YGE, even since her trainee days. So, is Jennie trying to hint at them, with these high SOLO performances, that shes better solo?

And yes I know the other BP ladies will be getting solos, but Jennies was first....of course. 

Anyways, try not to take too much of this seriously, it was just a fun thought coming from a fellow Blink. I like Jennie, but my BP bias is Lisa lol. 

I just dont want BP to end like 2NE1 did. ",13,1

Here it is and I would love to hear fellow kpoppers opinions! Thank you for your time :)

In my case, I have only one: Min Yoongi. I consider him my ultimate because I admire him not only as a musician but as a person. His voice and his simple presence make me feel something, not sure what but it's heartwarming. Of course I find him extremely attractive, but I don't think that's the main reason I have such a strong ""connection"" with him, clearly. I genuinely care about him; everyday I hope he's doing well.

In the other hand, soloist rapper Giriboy makes me feel quite the same way BUT I don't consider him an Ultimate bias, mostly because he's a soloist.

I'm curious about the criteria, specifically, of what people consider an Ult.",0,1

About a year ago I started traveling for work, and I have pretty manageable anxiety; but flying REALLY gets to me. I LOVE to travel and Ill get on a plane and be okay, but when I experience turbulence, internally I freak out. I tried downloading shows on Netflix to my iPad, watching the in flight movies, playing my Switch, etc. while these could entertain me, nothing took away my anxiety; Until, YouTube Music. On YT Music you can download music videos for offline viewing later. The amount of calmness and okay I feel when flying and watching Kpop is honestly something Ive NEVER experienced before. I dont freak out in intense turbulence anymore and it has really made me okay with traveling. I just wanted to share that with you guys and maybe help someone if they have some anxiety as well. I cant speak for everyone, but KPOP has definitely helped my anxiety and thats a beautiful effect that no other form of music has ever had on me. ",3,1

most of my argument goes for bts. i know that bts isnt the whole kpop community/fanbase, but im specifically keeping bts in mind. 

im a korean boy who generally loves all types of music. my mother grew up in korea and she agrees with me that its great that korea, a small place is getting hugely recognized. however, theres a problem. there are people out there who are oversexualizing these people, shipping them together and making very disgusting indepth fan fictions about them. i personally dont have anything against korean music, i do not listen to it though because of fanbase giving them a bad rep. the fact that we also have a huge beauty standard for the women in kpop is also disgusting, but i guess thats been normalized over the years. 

anyways, if you want to add onto my argument or rebuttal against me, feel free to do so. im using my freedom of speech. . thank you. 

TLDR; kpop fans are bad because they oversexualize my culture. ",12,1

&amp;#x200B;

2018 was a good year for Kpop. These are all my opinion and I welcome yours as well. I mainly only listen to GG so i'm biased there. Also I love many more songs that came out this year, but these came into my mind first.

1. **Hwasa - Be calm**: Beautiful, personal, intimate and Hwasa has a beautiful voice. This was perfect and one of my few 10s this year.
2. **Taeyeon - Circus**: Beautiful singing in this one. The background singing part may take a bit to get used to, but it's a special track. Also a very interesting meaning. It was popular enough that an official English lyric video was released. I can't wait for more of her music.
3. **Red Velvet - Bad Boy**: One of those songs that I couldn't stop listening to. Had a very good beat, choreography, and the singing was excellent. Everything just flowed well vocally, as well the underlying beat.
4. **BLACKPINK - (DDU-DU DDU-DU)**: One of the catchiest songs of the year. I love this group and this song was pretty strong in all its drops and mixing and all. Excellent rapping, singing and choreography. Forever Young comes pretty close but that was more top 20-30 material for me.
5. **Sunmi - Siren**: Such a strong song. Sunmi is such an amazing singer too. I loved the old school sound of the backing track. It reminded me of when I started listening to kpop around late 2008 or so. Also has quite a good meaning in the song.
6. **Apink - I'm So Sick**: This song was such a departure from their usual cute style. I found it to be excellent though. I'm really hoping their January comeback is more this style. I listened to it nonstop for quite a while. Plus whoever did the backing track with the singing on it is a genius.
7. **Mamamoo - Wind Flower**: Grew on me very quickly with a catchy beat, excellent vocals, and a strong message. Also some of the funnest choreography I saw this year.
8. **(G)i-dle - Hann**: After a very successful debut song the group floored me with this one. It really showed an excellent shift in their sound after what some may say was a safe debut song. So much good singing here and there is an excellent flow to the rhythm and sound. A group to look forward to in the future.
9. **fromis\_9 - Love Bomb**: This is actually one of the catchiest songs of the year. A cute message and honestly some relatively complicated singing. This one was stuck in my head so much after it came out I knew it was special. Another group i'm expecting bigger things from.
10. **Oh My Girl - Secret Garden**: A very pretty song. I love the meaning of it and I can just listen to it because it flows so well. Also the ladies this year had very improved vocals.

Just Missed: Twice - What is Love, EXID - I Love You, Twice - Yes or Yes, So many Mamamoo songs....

Bonus: A non kpop song that is a 10 from me is **Mitski - Nobody**. It resonated with me to an extreme degree and her whole CD is easily album of year material.",14,1

In my case, I have only one: Min Yoongi. I consider him my ultimate because I admire him not only as a musician but as a person. His voice and his simple presence make me feel something, not sure what but it's heartwarming. Of course I find him extremely attractive, but I don't think that's the main reason I have such a strong ""connection"" with him, clearly.

179,2018-12-21,2018,12,21,17,a87w05,A Musicians Evaluation of The Best Thing I Ever Did By TWICE ,cberm725,1545379898," DISCLAIMER: I am NOT bashing on Twice or being intentionally harsh in this evaluation/critique. Twice is my favorite group of all-time and I love the group to death. I am a proud ONCE and do not have intentions of demeaning any of the girls nor any of the JYP staff and whomever they may have hired in the process of making this song. It is simply a review and evaluation of the song in of itself.  
 

To start, I will say that personally, I dont like ballads at all. I see the appeal of them but my personal taste is more upbeat and something I can jam to. Opinions and biases aside, I will be reviewing/critiquing/evaluating/whateveryouwanttocallit-ing The Best Thing I Ever Did.  
 

The Best Thing I Ever Did is a very sweet and heartfelt ballad that suits Twices youthful and cute concept and also meshing nicely with the holidays. The song isnt emotionally driven and isnt a very powerful ballad. Rather it goes for a more laid back, relaxed feel that most ballads go for in their more mature, powerful and vocal focus. Twice doesnt suit the traditional ballad style which is what makes this song stand out. The more mature style of a traditional ballad would make it feel pretty awkward as a Twice song. I honestly cant think of a song of Twices that fits a more traditional ballad style. Be as ONE, Someone Like Me,  Turtle,   Jaljayo Good Night,  Ice Cream, One in a Million, Say Yes, and Like a Fool are their more ballidical songs. They all have a very poppy element to them. And while that is a solid number of tracks, the only one that I can see really fitting a ballad style is Be as ONE with its very heavy ballad style. The opening piano, soft harmonical vocals, drawn out chorus, the whole shebang makes it feel very much like a traditional ballad, it lacks the bit hit in each chorus and only has one about 70% of the way through the song. And the buildup and end to it are quite poor in my opinion. Think Ailee How Could You Do This to Me for an example. She always hits with super strong vocals and the chorus is clearly the big part of the song and she shows the hurt that is explained in the song. Now I dont know the meaning of Be as ONE but it doesnt have that hitting element of a traditional ballad. I know I got off topic so I digress.  
 

Back to the original topic, Best Thing as Im going to dub it for now, doesnt fit that style at all and is more of a pop ballad. Pop ballads tend to have lighter instrumentals and have a deeper underlying meaning to the song, at least from what Ive heard. Best Thing has a very unique, minimalistic instrumental with the piano, bells, literal sleigh bells, a soft drum set, and theres even shaker and tambourine if Im hearing it correctly. The song seems to start in F Major with a progression of I-iii-vi-IV (F-Am-Dm-Bb) with a V (C) chord sprinkled in at the beginning. The Bb chords 3rd is lowered from an E to and Eb making the chord Bb minor which isnt conventional, but isnt exactly unheard of either. Its a very subtle change and maybe Im not hearing it correctly. I dont have my keyboard nearby as Im out-of-town visiting family. Although they have a piano, its been at LEAST 20 years since its been tuned, and its kept in the hottest (or coldest depending on the time of day) part of the house. The Bridge changes to C minor with the same I-iii-vi-IV (C-Eb-Bb-F) progression which allows it to flow nicely back to the original key. Overall, I really like the instrumental and how well it flows. JYP never ceases to produce great songs and have a solid musical foundation to them.   
 

As for the vocals, theyre also very soft and well played out. Sana and Momo were the members that really stood out to me in this track. They seem to be more in their range compared to other songs where they seem to be in the higher register of their voice which causes strain on their vocal chords. Its specifically noticeable in Momos voice as she sounds a bit raspy and nasally more often than not. In this song her voice is super clear and crisp. Sanas vocal range in this song just sounds more natural. It seems as if shes always singing in almost a falsetto range in most of their title tracks and trying too hard to sound cute. The range of the vocals as a whole isnt that wide but it does modulate very nicely and fit the girls well. I wasnt blown away by the vocals but not necessarily impressed either. They seemed to be on par for what I expected. Nothing in the vocals stood out and had that WOW factor.  
 

Overall, the song is good. Great even. Giving my personal two cents, I like it and its one of my favorite pop-ballads. Im not a huge ballad fan, but I LOVE this song as it is. Its lighthearted, fun, and gives you that warm feeling that you might feel when cozying up with a nice book on a cold winter night next to the crackling fireplace. I know thats specific but thats what I envision. What really gets me in this song is the instrumental. It drives the song by not having super drawn out piano or bells. Its always moving and thats what I love. It moves the song around and doesnt lull me to sleep like a lot of ballads.  
 

Ok. Im done. Im sure I would have more thoughts about the song if I had actually taken more time to go over the song and given it more time to develop but I wanted to get this out there while its still relevant. If you have any comments or suggestions, Id love to hear it and discuss further. Ill take any (constructive) criticism that you may have. Again, Im not trying to demean anyone, just doing a bit of a deeper dive into a song. I dont see much content like this and I thought it might be fun to experiment with the idea. Please let me know if youd like to see more content like this. Thanks! !

though the jennie/kai news hasnt been confirmed yet, i thought it was a out of the blue, especially since i wouldnt have put them together as a couple (but best of luck to them). i was just wondering which idols you guys think would make great couples.

im not talking about which idol pairings are shipped together because they wear the same sweater or made eye contact at an award show, im talking about which idols you think would make great couples in terms of matching personalities, hobbies or even mannerisms. it doesnt have to be romantic pairings either, id love to know what friend pairings you think would work!

ill start: i think hani and chanyeol would be a pretty awesome couple! they both seem super goofy and very spontaneous and i feel like they have a similar sense of humor. let me know what you guys think!!",1,1

As I was thinking about them today, I was trying to come up with a list of my Variety All-Stars. Id be interested in hearing who your funniest idols are!

My list (for now):

Hong JinYoung - because shes freaking hilarious and adorable 

SooYoung (SNSD) - the several appearances I have seen for her on Running Man, she has shown quick wit and a great sense for comedic timing - would love to see her in a more permanent variety show

Yoon BoMi (APink) - Bomi kills it every time. Her stunts as co-host in Weekly Idol especially.

Who you got? :)

*I want to stop competing*  
*Competition at school, competition at work. When does it stop?*

I am a K-pop survival program enthusiast. I love the story of participants battling one another and overcoming fierce competition. A series of survival programs in South Korea, the start of which was Super Star K, has produced a number of prominent artists who are acknowledged on the global stage. They are positively affecting the brand image of Korea and contributing to the national economy. Some people are enthusiastic about this phenomenon, while others say that survival programs encourage excessive competition.

Things I mostly think these days are how kpop became different from kpop about 10\~5years ago.

Girls generation, T-ara, Secret, Miss A and whole lot of girl groups was at that era.

And I think hundreds of songs came out then was much varies and has its own color.

But bands these days, i think its really 'equalized'. I mean, I cant find any difference between them.

For example, in case of Girls' Generation' s &lt;Gee&gt;, can you even imagine secret or T-ara sings that? I cant.

But, in my case, i cant feel any discomfort if i imagine that red velvet sings twice's &lt;TT&gt;.

Girl groups today are mostly concepted with common image, and same sense of beats.

I think there're also effect of current music trend of TRAP music and retirement of original producers make beats feel common.

And I think thats the reason why many middle-size entertainment's bands are not really powerful compared to the past.

I hope girls groups going to debut after days have more various concepts and styles.

I really miss that era of kpop",11,1

Bit of backstory, whilst I had an extensive list of groups I adored you couldnt beat BTS for me (its so weird seeing them in mainstream media now though) and I swore down that Id never love someone as much as Kim Taehyung. I got my first year college roommate obsessed with them as well (Luckily she was a Jungkook kinda gal) and we had artwork and stickers posted EVERYWHERE in our house. It was great. 

Fast forward and now Im 21, living with my partner, talking about the prospect of marriage, finishing my degree in popular music and left that life behind. Im writing an essay about authenticity and Ive chosen to use Kpop as a subject as to why we dont need authenticity in our lives. I watched Save Me to write some notes about the sampling technique. Started writing, finished it crying my eyes out like the baby I secretly am and I know this means yet again, Im back. For fuck sake ",1,1

I was given the rare opportunity to do an assignment in my university course about kpop and the significance it has made globally. The assignment is focused more on culture and about youth/adolescents, but I appreciate any responses. I'm desiring to get a general understanding about why people follow kpop and how they find they are perceived by people around them.

Instead of giving out awards for the ""best of K-Pop"", these awards will be for the strangest, funniest, and downright worst of K-Pop in 2018.

**How to nominate and vote**

Categories for the Razzies can be anything your hearts can imagine.  So the first step is to post whatever category you want in the comments below.  Then other users (or even you) can add nominees to that category.  Be sure to include pictures and links when appropriate.  Everyone else upvotes the nominees they want to win.  Check out [last year's Razzie Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/7p1edy/1st_annual_rkpoppers_razzie_awards_2017/) if you need ideas or feel free to re-use your favorites.  At the end of the voting period, we'll take the top 25 most upvoted categories and announce the winners on r/kpop (for real this time).

**The voting period will end on February 5th at around 11:59 est.**

Remember to have fun and don't be too mean.  We will definitely be poking fun at idols and groups in this thread, but it's not open season to completely trash them or their fans.  Comments that cross the line will be removed.",267,1

14,2019-2-3,2019,2,3,8,amjqi7,A Musicians Evaluation of No by CLC (),cberm725,1549149817,"DISCLAIMER: CLC is a great group and I wish them all the best. By no means am I trying to demean or lift up anyone by any comparisons or relations. It is simply a review/analysis/evaluation of the song itself.  
 

First things first, I dont like this song. I had mixed feelings about it and I absolutely love parts of it but the parts I didnt like outweigh that to a point that it just killed the song for me. In fact, I deleted it from my Spotify while proofreading this. Now that Ive put my opinions and biases out there and given my two cents on the song Ill be putting that aside and looking at the song objectively.  
 

The song radiates a girl crush concept. Something CLCs transitioned to starting back with Hobgoblin on Crystyle two years ago. The Free\*SM mini-album was a bit of a departure from that but kept a more feminist concept imo (I havent seen the video so I cant say for sure). The song starts with Seungyeon talk-singing Red Lip? NO etc. I dont like talk-singing but here its acceptable and actually I would prefer it as it sets up the mood of the song. If you compare to their last comeback Black Dress, they did the same thing. The song starts with samples of the members saying black before the beat comes in. The same thing happens with No which is sort of disappointing as its not very creative production wise. While the beat is lighter and uses a heavier thumping bass, it doesnt take away from the fact that it feels a bit bland for the first 45 seconds or so. You only have the bass, and the girls vocals. You do have a more trap beat that comes in with Yeeun that adds good substance along with Eunbin before leading into the pre-chorus That Elkie and Seunghee absolutely SLAY that part. The biggest problem I have is the chorus being an improvement on the opening beat with samples of the Red Lip? NO part from the beginning spread throughout the beat. Its not as powerful as the pre-chorus and feels very jarring to a point where it breaks the immersion. The sort of EDM-like beat and vocally suppressed chorus seems to be a theme with some groups lately. Black Dress was the same way. La Vie En Rose by IZ\*ONE and Solo by Jennie jump out to me in recent memory. This style is by no means new but its more prominent recently. LATATA by (G)I-DLE even had a bit of it towards the end of its chorus. It feels very underwhelming and sort of deflates the great buildup to the chorus. Unless Im wrong and Elkie and Seunghee are singing the chorus and the drop, for lack of a better term, is a post-chorus. Either way it has the same effect. It almost seems like the composers/producers were going for an effect that feels like a major departure from the main song but fits well. They only hit one of those points perfectly. The other not so much. A song that does this perfectly is Bboom Bboom by Momoland. Back to No, the beat in the beginning is called back in the chorus with minimal vocals. The only part that I cant draw similarities between No and Black Dress to is the bridge. Black Dress has a much more vocally focused and instrumentally light bridge before calling back some backing vocals and the chorus for a sort of anthem-like ending. The Bridge in No seems like the dance break at the end of Solo. Fast-paced and instrumentally heavy. They do add vocals on top of it but its basically what was said in the beginning. The items they list off are translated as Heels, perfume, Handbag (literally in the beginning), and makeup. The next set is personality traits of Innocent, sexy, and aegyo (no real literal translation). Its pretty uncreative just putting that over it.  
 

Theres not a lot musically to say about this. Im having a hard time determining what key its in but from what Im hearing mainly in the pre-chorus, it seems to be in D Major. It starts on the minor iii with F#m, then goes to the diminished vii C# resolves to the I. The vi Bm is in there somewhere but I cant see why. Other than that. The bass and trap beat pretty much stays with F#m and C# sometimes throwing AM into the mix.   
 

To conclude, it has a lot of similarities to Black Dress which is pretty disappointing after them having almost and entire year between comebacks (343 days to be exact). Then again, its CUBE, and after 2018 my expectations for their artists activities are pretty low. I see where people like this song. I see the appeal of it but I personally dont find it very enticing or creative. The song does have a very proud, feminist message that goes well with the rising feminism movement in Korea at the moment. ",0,1
15,2019-2-3,2019,2,3,8,amjt2d,Ultimate Group Chooser mobile game,Pemtech,1549150283,"Hello kpoppers,

I'm a novice android developer who absolutely loves kpop. I've been a huge fan of kpop for about 4 years now and ever since then I've read, watched and played almost everything kpop related. Finally I got the idea for an app that I think other people would enjoy as much as I do.

&amp;#x200B;

'Kpop Ultimate Group Chooser' is an easy time killing game where you get presented with two images of two different groups and you need to choose between the two. The one you choose stays on the screen while the other group changes into another. You need to keep choosing between your favourite groups until you find out your ultimate group. You might have to make hard decisions but it's all part of the fun!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you'll try my game and give me feedback about it. Also if you have any game or app ideas, I'll be happy to hear them and try to make your ideas a reality if I have the skill required!

I made a short and crappy demo of this about 2-3 months ago, but I finished the project last month and never followed up here. I've been a big Kpop fan for over a decade, but Bad Boy is one of my favorite tracks of all time. Between the Genius video on the Making Of Bad Boy and trying to get into synth/DAWs myself, I took recreating this song as a challenge and method of learning more.   


I have the exact drum loop (courtesy of the Julez Jadon kits), the exact timing / sylenth1 presets for the lead (via LeLotusBleu) and the chords (via Arksun sound). The original bass uses Trillian, which costs as much as my DAW, synth, presets, and drum loops combined and then some -- so I modified a typical Kpop bass synth to the closest sounding option I could. The snaps aren't quite as nice as the ones used in the original, either. The main thing it's missing, aside from intentionally removing the vocals, are a bunch of small things in the chorus -- there's the police sirens, heys, and some reverse drums. These work well in the original song for sure, but also there's a wall of nearly half a dozen vocal harmonies, and I think it sounds a bit strange if you're some guy or girl singing this alone for fun. 

  
Lastly, I made some minor changes. There's these amazing chords that start with the prechorus that compliment the lead so well... and they're a little unnoticed in the original, so I turned them up a couple decibels to my version to clarify it. The final version of Bad Boy uses a slightly different syncopation for these chords, and I preferred how they sounded in the demo -- so I kept the original timing used in the demo.  I also changed the bass part very slightly in the bridge because the original puts the sweeps on the off-beats, and I changed them slightly to line up with the standard placement for a 4/4 beat (think it'd be easier to sing along with, as well.)   


Vocaroo/YT really lower the sound quality, including some static and popping noises that simply don't exist in my MP3 versions. If anyone is interested in having the song as a back-up for karaoke or vocal cover, feel free to mention it here or send me a PM. I'll happily email you the higher quality MP3, and I can tailor the mix to retaining sound quality or boosting volume for you easily. I'm happy to make any other alterations you may specifically want too (I have .wavs for the chorus sound bytes (siren, heys, etc) for example -- though at this point you might as well just download the original.) Or maybe you want to know what it sounds like with completely different synths, idk. Just let me know.  


Thanks so much for your time!

I did my by-the-books cover of Bad Boy a while back, and I thought I'd do a cover of Love Scenario... only, as an experiment to try out my newest effects, presets, and synths I bought with part of my tax refund. It's mostly for myself, but maybe a die-hard fan of iKon or Love Scenario will be able to appreciate the effort, or hear a fan cover of their beloved song sounds like with the instrumentation changed.

I used to dream about working the K-ent industry, not as idol but as an intern/manager something like that. I know I was crazy back then and I told everyone in my family about this dream of mine. I applied to the companies that were more established in the US, that bridged kpop the most globally MNET, CJE&amp;M but I also applied to actual Kpop companies. I didnt speak Korean very well. I was still taking classes, so I had someone help me compose an email basically asking if there were any internship opportunities for foreigners. I believe Mnet had something like that waaay back, but nothing else was available. Of course no one replied to my cold emails, except one. It was bighit. I dont remember the exact wording but it translated to Thank you for your interest. As of now, there arent any openings but I can confirm with out HR department. Please send your resume if youd like. Thank expressing your interest in our company This was around 2016-2017. I remember jumping up and down from excitement. I know it didnt mean anything but the fact that they replied made me feel really touched. I was a nobody and they entertained a foreigner with a silly inquiry like mine. I didnt follow through or anything with the email. I gave up on that dream. Idk you become more realistic as you get older, but I did make a promise to support BTS because of this. They werent my main group in the past....Dont get me wrong, I love their music! But I made it a point to support them because of their great work ethic, personalities and talent. Also, they have such an awesome team behind them. Idk any other company who is as nice and accommodating to people outside the company/fans. I thought Id share this random story because I came across the other day of an article that mentioned how Bighit had the lowest employee turnover rate,highest employee satisfaction   and how much the company has doubled its employees.

186,2019-2-20,2019,2,20,6,asfxh6,[Repost] What happened with CL's US career? Here is my analasys/opinion. (Spoiler: It is not all YG's fault),OriginalPromise,1550613161,"So CL, the ""ex-YG Princess"", and my first and ultimate bias, announced her US debut on 2014. There were tons of articles flooding out announcing her big US debut, with her colab with Diplo, and her signing with Scooter Braun. On paper, she had everything. She had fat financial support from YG, big name collaberations with Diplo and connections in the US with will.i.am, and top-grade management from Scooter Braun. But why are we still waiting for a damned album 4 (now almost 5) years later? With recent news that BOM is coming back (yay!) and me revisiting 2NE1 due to the news, lets talk about this. Before we get there, here is what I think.

**\*These are my opinions and you are free to disagree and debate. Some of the info here are also my educated specualtion from actual sources\***

1.Scooter Braun didn't do shit.

I believe that he never actively supported CL. He was too busy jerking off Ariana Grande and Bieber and other money makers within his arsenal . For example, SB never promoted her US tour, didn't support her make-up endorsements, didn't say a word for the *My Little Pony* OST, didn't have a clue about CL's big Olympic performance, etc. If you actually think about it, most of the US activities were set up by YG, starting from *Hello Bitches* to *Lifted*. If you go on iTunes and look up the publisher for *Lifted*, it's not ""Schoolboy Records"", SB's label. It's actually YG, and soley YG. Who paid for Paris Goebel and her crew? YG did. Who paid for the Lifted video and studio time, and promotions? YG did. Who paid for all the studio times for the crap ton of songs that she recorded, and music videos that she shot that never got released to the public? YG did. Am I saying that SB had nothing to do with CL and didn't do anything for her? No. I can still see his name and affiliation listed in the credits, and can see the ties between her work and his connections (ex. Paris Goebel's crew was also in JB's Sorry video). But did he do EVERYTHING that he can? Hell no. Compared to the amount of effort and time that went into JB's album, or Ariana's ventures, CL got nothing.

1.1. Scooter said that it was YG's fault and that YG was too controlling but I think it's a big fat lie

SB never mentioned anything about CL on his twitter. If he did, it was because of CL's dedicated fans spamming him to get his attention. But when the news broke out that CL is no longer working with SB, SB decides to ""conveniently"" talk with a fan and have him [leak the convo](https://www.kpopmap.com/conversation-between-cl-and-scooter-braun-suggests-she-is-being-held-back/). Bullshit. He never talked about her activites or cared about them while actively promoting Grande and Bieber, and when her contract is up and getting heat from fans, he decides to talk to one fan and have him convinently ""leak"" the convo. He makes all this press about how she's signed under him and is going to do wonders for her career, then when the apple finally hits the ground, he tells starved fans that YG was too controlling when you already published some of her work under your label? He actively states that she was signed then tells the fan that she never got her papers togehter. It doesn't make sense legally, logically, emotionally, or financially that SB started to work on CL BEFORE all the paperwork was intact. I think this was genius on his part because he kept fans starved about anything related to CL, and finally ended up throwing a bone to crazy fans to cover his ass after taking all the money from YG while doing nothing for CL. CL and Scooter also ""agreed"" that it was all YG's fault, but I think that was CL just putting blind faith in SB and kissing ass that he is going to do something for her one day, when he never will; like he never did with PSY's career, or The Wanted and drove that group into the ground; angering YG and drowning his name in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2.  YG doesn't think CL is able to recoup investment costs

This is pretty self explanitory. YG poured a crap ton of resources into CL's debut. But once *Lifted* launched, it performed badly. It wasn't recieved well in the US with ""only"" 29 million views at the time of writing. So put yourself in YG's shoes. We  can all agree that he's a greedy money hoe, but you invest all this money, time, and effort into CL's debut, but fail to see money coming in. Why would you want to pour more time and effort into what already turned out to be a poor performer? Look at BTS or Blackpink. Did Big Hit and YG push BTS and BP the same way that they did with CL? No, yet they are recieving better reactions and ticket sales. (They didn't even formally ""debut"" yet)  YG saw CL's debut to be a failure and didn't see it getting better, so he stepped out; which I think is totally reasonable.There was a song called *All In* that she leaked\*,\* and also a *Hello Bitches* music video that never got released. He deems CL to be too risky of an investment, thus discontinuing his support for her US activities, which explains CL getting frustrated with YG and the drama caused within.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. CL is too keen on wanting a career in the US, despite a strong fanbase in Asia, costing 2NE1 in the process indirectly

So CL grew up in the US, and I think that the following life experience pressures her to persue a US debut. Korea was always a foregin country to her, and I think she wants to be regcognized at where she can call home. Despite having a strong career in Asia, she decided to persue a US career in 2014, before BTS's success and when Korean artists finding success in the US market was basically unheard of, except for PSY being the outlier. This decision indirectly costed 2NE1 their livelihood, and put their activities on hold. Now Bom's scandal is the main catalyst that forced 2NE1's long hitatus, but I believe CL's debut plans also caused some delays and eventually contributed to the cancelation of 2NE1's comeback, after Minzy left. I also think she decided that her success and fame in asia is not enough for her. Why else would she leave a market where she is already respected and immensely successful in, to a market that no other Korean artist was able to penetrate? She mentioned in an [interview](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/11/cl-sheds-tears-while-talking-about-her-advancement-in-america) that she would never quit until she eventually breaks into the American market. In that interview, Taeyang also urges CL to come back to the Korean market, but she stubbornly tells him that she is determined to have a career in the US. Her personal want for a US debut disallowed her to think logically and  face reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My Opinion: I can personally get behind her dreams and aspirations and it is understandable where it comes from, but I think she needs to be realistic. Statistically, the odds were never in her favor, and now that she has bad blood with YG, I don't see any of the music and projects that she did with YG being released any time soon, and I also think that YG is the only company that could've and was willing to support CL to this caliber. What other company is going to able to back CL? SM, after they failed with BoA? JYP after they failed with Wonder Girls? Smaller companies that lacks resources to even promote idols in the same caliber as the big 3?

I rediscovered CL when I heard of BOM's comeback. 2NE1 was the group that ultimately brought me into K-pop, and also the only group that had a killer stage presence that I think modern groups lack. (Not saying that modern releases suck) And the more I re-read the tweets, her comments in interviews, and think about the situation logically, I personally don't see a one-size-fits-all answer for CL. Many people tend to just scapegoat YG, including CL and SB, but I really don't think that's the case. I think CL landed here in the shitty situation she is in because of all three parties involved, including her.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love CL, but I think she kinda dug her own grave. SB dug it with an excavator, while CL walked in. Shit started piling up within the last 4 years, and YG put the final nail on the coffin when he decided the CL wasn't profitable. I think it's a shame that such a one of a kind talent was burried like this, but wheter CL can dig herself out this year remains to be the question. I guess she can be like SNSD Tiffany and move into another label like Transparent Arts and continue her US ventures, but only time can tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is an **opinion**. Feel free to disagree and reflect on it, and I did specualte to fill in the missing pieces. Not everything may be factual and this is my **opinion**. Please be respectful in the comments as I know this is a sensitive issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for coming to my long ass ted talk.

42,2019-3-6,2019,3,6,4,axpglo,I really need to share my K-Pop experience with someone. I also have a few questions as a newbie.,flippdipp,1551815932,"I just recently got into k-pop a couple months ago and I don't know anyone else in my real life that is into it, so I just found this community and wanted to share so I hope this is the right place. I knew k-pop was a thing but never really paid any attention to it for most of my life. The first group I heard about was BTS randomly from a youtube video I watched from a Korean youtuber who danced to DNA. I was like hmm that song is pretty cool what's BTS? So I looked into their music and added some new songs to my playlist. In the process, I found out more about them and their story and the leaps and bounds they've accomplished for k-pop artists on an international scale ,so I kind of got a little starstruck and watched enough dance practices, mvs, performances, and variety show clips until I knew who was who. At this point, I thought neat I can follow BTS and like k-pop low-key it will be great! Enter Monsta X, listened to HERO since it was in my recommendeds on spotify and really liked it so I watched the dance practice and well the rest is history. Learned who's who and I was like ok two groups is manageable I can do this its still low-key. Then, I watched GOT7's ask-in-a-box on a whim and that's when I knew I was in trouble lol. Finally, got names and faces down for them and thought I would be satisfied. At first I didn't know that some groups are formed from survival shows like MX was so ended up watching No Mercy (so emotional btw jeez) and one of the comments said that MK debuted in ONF, so I mean I had to take a look, and ended up downloading literally every song they have on spotify. I haven't had as much time lately so still learning names and faces, but omg what is happening to me??? This doesn't even take into account the groups that I've come across that have songs in my playlist (stray kids, ikon, btob, EXO, blackpink, red velvet, and don't even get me started on NCT, and now ATEEZ and TXT!!! god help me) that I want to follow but I am trying not to sell my soul to this, it might be too late though. Sorry I mostly like boy groups so far, but can anyone blame me. I think at this point I'm officially kpop trash and I guess I'm not sorry. My current playlist has like 5 songs in English and even one of those is by DEAN lol. So if anyone actually read all that was it like this for anyone else or am I just a crazy obsessive weirdo and I'm also really curious because no matter what group I stan I've never been able to choose a bias. Is it normal to have one? How is it even possible. I'd love to be able to hear people's reasoning about it since I have no one to gush to about any of this. Thanks for your time.",24,23

I grew up listening to anything metal/rock. I spent 20 years listening to the same 50 songs over and over and as time went on I would stop turning on the radio. I was getting tired of the same songs on rotation for years upon years. When she started to listen to kpop I rolled my eyes wouldn't even give it a chance. As time went on I would find that kpop songs were stuck in my head and I found it annoying. You're not going to hit me with that Du-dudu-du-du. I'm too much of a man for that.

That's when she started explaining things like ""bias's"" to me and she forced me to pick one. I chose Wendy from Red Velvet cause, cute. About two weeks later I was singing Ice Cream Cake in my head. Then it was TT by Twice. Then I heard Black Pink and I was like wow. The beats are amazing. The way the songs were arranged was amazing. But what I noticed is, I had a new love of music. I have never heard anything like that before and was finding myself reading about the bands online and looking up songs. I must have listened to CLC - I like it 500 times in two weeks. I was hooked. But I was too ashamed to play it in the car with the windows down for fear of looking like less of a man. That soon changed.

Look, I'm not good at saying what I feel the correct way. I know this post is in terrible format but the point is that now I love kpop. I love the fans. I love the fact that I can enjoy music again and have this huge catalog of new songs (new to me anyway) that I can enjoy. I no longer get annoyed by whats on the radio because it's now usually a kpop song I haven't heard. I roll down the windows and blast Very, very, very. I crank up CLC - No. I love me some Twice. And I've started to like boy bands in kpop because they don't mess around. They just shred those lyrics.

So, thank you kpop for giving me my love of music back. Thank you for welcoming a metal loving guy into the fold. And thank you, Wendy for being awesome. I'm now just a music lover not a metal/rock lover. I found out that no matter how old I am I still can learn something new. And I'm excited for US tours of bands because WENDY SIGN MY SHIRT!!

And mostly, thank you to my wonderful wife for opening my eyes and sharing something she loves with her husband. It's helped our relationship grow because we have more to share with each other. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.",8,43

Saw some group called PD48 sang it, then found out that it's just some TV show. It's clearly not unknown as it has a couple of million views but how is a song that polished being released by a reality tv show. I think it's better than all the popular songs I heard last year and would be in the hundred of million views if Twice/Blackpink had released it, sweeping awards etc

I realise you could say this for any unknown song but objectively as someone newish who has listened to most popular kpop songs from 2018 and has no bias, Rumour is a certified banger and catchy as hell.",4,0

I was thinking about this earlier, about how some fans do and say some things due to ignorance or just lack of experience in life or some other reason. Sometimes they'll get into heated arguments online and may or may not learn from them because they feel slighted. 

So I thought of creating this ""explanation thread"" here so you guys could list certain  fan (or even artists) behaviours or that are wrong and calmly explain why they are too.

Hoping we can all learn from the stuff that's posted on here. 

Have some green tea, cookies, and a nice day! ",1,6

but to be honest, I was let down by the song, just the song. The styling, makeup, hair, the GIRLS were so on point and they saved the song. 
The actual song wasn't too exciting....i mean, i was expecting a lot since it involved Teddy and R.Tee but dang I was pretty let down. 
ofc i gave the song may listens but it is still really hard to get into. the song is lacking a lot of bass and there is not a lot of dynamic plus the chorus wasn't too catchy for me. 

What do you guys think about the SONG?

Their debut song is really good, the members are really cool, and they're amazingly stable in their live stages. Not saying that you should stan but you should stan. They're super entertaining too.

Things aside, thoughts of BC have been bugging me these days. I found information on him way before his 1team days and it turns out that he got some hate due to his leading in Boys24 (no wonder Rubin is leader) and bullying incident. It makes me wonder if he isn't as good natured as I think he is. I know he already apologised but I'm still kind of wary.

Don't get me wrong, he's talented and I love all of them but it just bugs me out... I know he probably reflected and changed, if not why would Liveworks want to risk debuting someone with past scandals right? I still have some reservations on being a complete stan yet, although he seems pretty chill and nice... any thoughts?",4,5

I'm a 16 (almost 17) years old boy living in Germany. I'm listening to kpop since the end of 2015. I thought it could be quiet interesting for some how it is to be a fanboy, since the kpop community has a huge female fanbase.
So you can ask me some questions I'll try to answer honestly. I also would have one or two stories I could tell about problems as a male kpop fan caused by our society (maybe more the society in Germany, because I think this whole thing is more ""appreciated"" in the US).
So don't mind asking (if anyone does see this post xD).

I thought I'd try creating a Kpop challenge. I only did four songs because this takes a while, but I'd be happy to do more if people enjoy them.   


*A QUICK FOREWORD:*  
Unfortunately, there's 5-6 short localized moments of squeaking that came along with this: 4-5 on SONG 2 @ the end of ROUND 2 and throughout ROUND 3, and 1 on SONG 4 ROUND 3. Sorry, I have cheap recording software. :\\ But please **do not** listen at max volume or feel free to skip ahead to avoid hearing this (times listed at end.)   


LINK FOR THE CHALLENGE:  [https://vimeo.com/330442540](https://vimeo.com/330442540)   


The idea is in each round for this challenge, a new part of each song is added until there's 6 main parts that create the majority of the main melody/rhythm for a popular kpop song. Round 1 will be nearly impossible to recognize, and each round adds progressively recognizable elements until round 6. If you still can't figure it out after round 6, the acapella vocals will appear shortly after so you can hear everything together.  


I hope someone enjoys this! Feel free to leave comments, like what round you recognized each song (or not), differences in difficulty, etc -- or criticisms. Thanks!   


ROUND 1 0:00 -- 1:41  
ROUND 2 1:41 --  3:22 (SKIP 2:08-2:19 TO AVOID BLIPS)   
ROUND 3 3:22 -- 4:31  
ROUND 4 4:31 -- 5:38 (BLIP @ 4:44 FOR SKIPPING)",0,1

Sadly, GD is still away on military enlistment, but VIPs will always be waiting for him. Hes the King, after all. 

However, it should be noted that since BTS is gaining a whole ton of popularity, a lot of newcomers know the members more. So its possible that Taehyung and Jungkook are gaining lot more popularity and traction than GD right now. That does beg the question about the difference between famous/iconic and popular/relevant, though. So would one say that V is more famous than GD right now because hes more relevant, or would it be more correct to say that GD is more famous because hes more iconic and historically impactful?",0,2

PREDICTION #1 

East Meets West: The Queen of Pop w/ The Golden Boy from Busan 

Now Ill be honest with you, this is FARFETCHED  Nah, more like a Fanfiction  but Ill be honest, these two looked cute with each other, then again when two beautiful representatives collide with each other, its really more of a force of nature rather than cute couple. If you dont know what Im talking about, its Jeon Jung-Kook and Ariana Grandes #Flawless photo-op that was bestowed by the Instagram gods on my feed. Why do I think this? In simple terms, they would be a FIRE couple, like JayZ and Beyonc FIRE. In my terms, its just a gut feeling, itd be comparable to the royal couple of Meghan Merkle and that British prince (Harry?) 

PREDICTION #2 

Daegu boy snaps with a full fledged solo album 

I just need a big hit labeled solo album by Suga pls 

PREDICTION #3 

Mochi also goes Solo

No indication this will be true, but Jimin going solo as well. If I could get an album with the same vibes as Serendipity and Promise Ill be forever indebted to you Jimin-nim.

But then, I gave it a try again and I loved it. I feel like it has an addictive vibe (like most kpop songs, lmao)

I honestly feel like txt has a lot of potential as a kpop group...

[What can Crypto learn from K-Pop and Justin Sun?](https://i.redd.it/hdukk3m6o1y21.jpg)

K-Pop band [BTS](https://bts.ibighit.com/eng/profile/index.php) were No 1 in the UK and US music charts in April 2019. Justin Sun's [TRON](https://tron.network/about?lng=en) was ranked No 11 in blockchain at the time. So, what can Crypto learn from Korea's most successful K-Pop export and from blockchain's most brazen self-publicist?

Which artists do you like that deserve *so* much more? And why?



I'll start:


Speed: probably the most underrated bg in the history of Kpop 

Their songs? Total bops

Their choreos? Iconic and insanely good

Their concept? Speed circus was iconic ngl

Their vocals? That high note in what u speaks lengths

Their stage presence and live performances? Damn

Some friends and I are looking to put together a dance group to learn the choreography to Butterfly by LOONA: https://youtu.be/ADJorSdTRCI

There are 12 people in this dance and 3 of us already. We are looking for at least 5 more members to dance along with us,  at the most 9 more people so we can have everyone in LOONA. 

Our goal is to learn the dance and participate in a dance competition at Holiday Matsuri, an anime convention that takes place in December. So we have plenty of time. We are located in the Orlando area so please be close by! You DO NOT have to be a kpop or loona fan to join us as I myself only really like Loona lmao. The dance just looks really fun and we're very interested in putting it together. 

Please join us!!! It can be so much fun! Please DM if you have any questions at all,

I came up with an idea based on what I saw in the comments of Somi's Inkigayo performance on 20190616:https://youtu.be/KDhAB7lIQyU

Her outfit was a bit awkward, so many people commented on how she needs a new stylist and better outfits. After reading so many, I went to Pinterest and set up a folder of single pieces to make up outfits that fit the vibe and aesthetic of the song. It was actually a lot of fun. It got me thinking. What if I made like an IG or Twitter account dedicated to outfits that I think would fit the vibe/aesthetic of an idol, music video, song, group, etc. Just something fun since putting together kpop-inspired outfits has proven to be entertaining. That and who knows? I might just get acknowledged as a stylist one day ",3,7

ok so basically this started when me and my friends were all having a casual discussion about the three girl groups. i am a new kpop fan and only recently got introduced to the industry. each one of my three friends argued for each person and idk which one is right for the title of ""BEST DANCER""

people argue that lisa isnt actually that good but my friend says that its just because her group is made up of 4 members and thats why her choreorgraohy cant really come through as there is not much you can do with the limited amount f positions, similarly this is why she argues why momo isnt as good because she thinks everything looks better with the 9 people groups and all the formations, canons and other dance techniques that can be implemented

she also says that lisa is much better compared to her other members so therefore she has to do less advanced stuff to accomodate

my other friend says that Seulgi is the best because even in songs like Be Natural and Automatic which are slower she still dances well.

another reason towards lisa is that she can supposedly just learn songs by 'looking at them' as seen by the video of her learning what is love and red flavour after a single watch

in twices likey and a few other songs momo also gets center dance break

so which of my friends is right??",6,3

Super cool imo, so thought I should share it here.

183,2019-6-21,2019,6,21,9,c33sey,Welcome to r/kpoppers. Here's an introduction!,NishinosanTV,1561077622,"Welcome to r/kpoppers! 

[r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/) is an amazing community for enjoying and discussing the latest K-Pop  news and releases, but there's also a whole lot of K-Pop-related content  that doesn't fit in; especially the things that K-Pop fans pour their hearts into creating. This subreddit is focused on you guys, the fans, and what you create and share with the rest of us. Whether it's a song  cover, dance cover, remix, reaction video, compilation video, fan art, or just funny meme or joke, it's all welcome here.

[r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) is the final piece in our vision for a complete [""K-Pop Ecosystem"" on Reddit.](https://i.imgur.com/EUHaYLK.jpg)

The linked diagram should help clear up what content goes in which sub.  The three main subs, [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/), [r/kpophelp](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/), and now [r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) are managed by same mod team that you all love *or maybe hate*,  so you'll get consistent visual style and moderation across all three  subs. Although this subreddit will be more casual, it's not ""Friday-For-All"" every day here.  We have [detailed rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/wiki/rules) and active moderators to enforce them.  Official content that belongs in [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/) will stay there, questions that go in [r/kpophelp](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/) will stay there, and group content that belongs in the group subreddits will stay there.  We also have the same great flair and filtering  system that we created for [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/). If you don't want to see fan covers, you can just click and hide them, or if you're searching for a certain remix, hit the flair and find all  of them in one click.  If you want to see all three subs on one page, this [multi-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop+kpophelp+kpoppers/) is exactly what you need.

As we said, [r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) is primarily focused on fan-created material. Anything that you, or a  member of the K-Pop community have created will fit in great here.  We have 16 custom flairs that cover just about every type of post that you  might encounter.  Here's the full list:

* **Funny** \- This includes memes, shitposts, reaction gifs, jokes, whatever is funny.
* **Compilation** \- Videos of your favorite idols or themes all mashed together.
* **Fan MV** \- Create your own MV for your favorite song and share it.
* **Remix** \- Become the producer and drop your fresh remix or share your favorites.
* **Mashup** \- When two songs love each other very much...
* **Song Cover** \- Let us hear you sing or share your favorite fan covers.
* **Dance Cover** \- Think you can dance?
* **Podcast** \- Have a favorite K-Pop podcast? Share it with us.
* **Reaction** \- All your favorite reaction channels are here.
* **Review** \- Share breakdowns of songs or albums and why they don't suck.
* **Article** \- Funny, sarcastic, edgy, not-quite-news articles from the community.
* **Meta** \- This post!
* **Fan Art** \- Share awesome artwork of K-Pop stuff or people.
* **Collection** \- Unboxings, shelves of CDs, walls of posters, show us what you got.
* **Misc** \- Fan-made stuff that we forgot to include a flair for.  D'oh!
* **Discussion** \- Talk about anything you want any time you want.

That's a lot of stuff!  If you're a content creator, feel free to post your own content here, but check out Rule 3 on the sidebar.  In fact, give  all those rules a good read and mouse-over them for more information about each.  If you're not a content creator, please share your  favorites from around the K-Pop community so that we can all enjoy them, or start a discussion about any K-Pop topic you want. No topics are stale here!

We're going to do our very  best to support this subreddit and help it grow.  If you think this sounds good, let us hear your ideas for it.  What kind of weekly  features would you like here?  Should we make any adjustments to the  rules?  You guys know that we take your suggestions to heart, so speak up in the comments or drop us a modmail. Thank you all for checking out this subreddit! We hope that you'll stick around, click that join button, and start submitting cool content. 

Welcome to [r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/), K-Poppers!

137,2019-7-13,2019,7,13,5,ccfyn6,"Why is Hwasa the only ""real"" succesful soloist in Mamamoo?",MaxwellSH,1562962208,"I love Hwasa and she is my bias and a queen but why is she the only ""real"" succesful soloist from Mamamoo?

As we know Mamamoo is already 5 years old(time flies fast :D) and after the 7th year they won't have as many comebacks and probably focus on solo work/acting. In fact they have already started their solo careers with members debuting one after another. 

They usually have solo tracks in their group albums but don't have MVs for them. In fact Hwasa even had a solo song in their debut album called ""I Do Me""(great hip hop song btw). 

So let's have a look at their solos so far:
1. Solar
-She has not had her debut so far but she has an album with remakes of old songs from veterans in South Korea. Also stream ""Honey Bey"" it's iconic :D.

2. Wheein
-Wheein debuted on April 2018 with the digital single ""Easy"" featuring Sik-K. The song did well for a debut and peaked at number 36 on the Gaon Digital Chart. She also released the song ""25"" on 25th of May 2019 and it didn't do well because it was an unexpected comeback and limited promotions didn't help either ;(.

3. Moonbyul 
-Moonbyul debuted on may 2018 with ""Selfish"" featuring Seulgi of RedVelvet. The song peaked at number 84 on the Gaon Digital Single Chart and it became quite popular on Youtube reaching 15 milion views so far. International fans of Mamamoo and RedVelvet loved the song and it was overall well received. 

4. Hwasa
-Hwasa debuted recently in February 2019 with the single ""Twit"". As we all know the song was well received and peaked at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and on number 3 on the Billboard US World Digital Songs chart. The debut was extremely succesful and it even received a music show win on Music Core. 

Conclusion: To me it seems like with each debut they are becoming more and more succesful and they all have very different styles and genres and ""Twit"" was a pop song with elements of the house genre(something pretty popular in kpop rn). I hope all the other members achieve success with their solo work and I hope it doesn't turnout to be a Miss A-Suzy situation. Hwasa is really popular and her personality is adored by fans. Not all of them can be succesful but Hwasa has been doing pretty well while the others can't really pass the success of Mamamoo. To me Hwasa's video/song/promotions were all excellent but I hope the other members are also treated well.

174,2019-7-17,2019,7,17,14,ce8tfu,YG is one of the best companies.,MaxwellSH,1563343023,"YG is shit and we all know it but for the love of god they are not the worst company knowing they are far better than others. 

We all know of small companies who abuse their trainees/idols. Here is the [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FTyrHOGqmVw) of Grazy Grace that didn't reveal which is her company and covered it with an emoji everytime the sign comes but at a split second you cat catch it in this [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7DZyBmZnge0). If you manage to do it than congrats it's Nega Network.

Does it ring a bell? Yeah because Brown Eyed Girls were once under their label. Overall Grazy Grace talks how she was yelled at, strict dieting and the company calling them ugly and letting them rot essentially. They made group A and group B and A were the ""pretty"" ones(although she is really pretty too I don't understand) that got to debut while the manager just cut group B and were thrown away from their dorms to the point she had to live in the manager's shitty apartment. 

She talked how the company was trying to get investors in and basically have a joint idol group because Nega Network was too poor. She said the company had one popular group(Brown Eyed Girls) and the other company had a semi-popular boy group(it's most likely NH ENT. so I guess U-Kiss but it's possible the investor was different back then or smt). She also talked how the company had a boy group(LC9) that they debuted and didn't have a comeback and just took all the presents fans gave them and after jeeping them in the dungeon for 2 years just disbanded them. So who is group A and did they debut? Yes they did and yes the girl group is Laboum. The group is a joint venture between Nega Network and NH ent. so I guess U-Kiss although I will call them popular idk. Also I forgot to mention how shitty NH are but I myself don't know much about them or U-Kiss although I have seen pretty disturbing things about them. I think I saw a video or smt about them but I am not sure.

Laboum has went as far as winning a music show win and has been relitively sucessful and you can go watch predebut videos and it's the same training room Grazy showed. The fact that the compnay has been able to go unnoticed for their abuse towards idols/trainees just shows how bad things are. Ofcourse there are companies that are known and confirmed abusers towards their artists like TS ent. 

Most small companies are just abusive and usually disband you if you don't have success in your first comeback or smt. The amount of groups debuting is huge and you can go see how many get unnoticed because of their compnay being unable to promote them and disbanding them the next year. 

There are other abusive companies and there is even a Youtube channel called [Chaennie Lisoo](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCJXAcIHDsFlD6bMUXBA4d_Q) that has made many videos about small companies that are abusive and outright inhuman towards their idols. She has made many videos about small companies that even when they have a popular group are still abusive and promote them badly.

Hell even CNA designer made a [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G66uRJ6pAfI) about it and the life of a japanese trainee in a small company and the instructor/teacher was so rude and yelled at her pushing her back ON CAMERA. Mind you this is not some idol or anything but a news outlet or smt and they revealed their cruel ways of training to the entire world just like that. The company is Star Road enterteintment.

What I am trying to say is that there are so many small companies that do things that are illegal and inhuman, cruel, disgusting and you are gonne tell me YG is the worst company? No, they are one of the best companies because they atleast have money and are a part of big 3 so their group is guranteed success and attention when they debut and are not abusive as the other small companies. They have done some bad stuff but they can't compare to the likes of the smaller companies.

Smaller companies are THAT BAD that YG is considered one of the best companies and nobody cares or pays attention ti that but do when it's YG? YG is still a bad company but they are not worse than the standard and are actually pretty good knowing other companies out there. 

It's just kinda strange how people claim they are the worst when there have been so many bad companies that YG is a saint next to them. 

You can comment other small companies that have abused their idols down in the comment section as I don't know every single company and there have been to many that have been able to just... idk go unnoticed.",1,1

220,2019-7-22,2019,7,22,15,cg9jfs,Hi all! I'm doing a research project on K-pop fans and would greatly appreciate some responses to the following questions :),yoongisteak,1563776238,"1. **When did you first fall in love with K-Pop?**
2. **How does being a K-pop fan impact other areas of your life?**
3. **Do you ever feel a need to lead a 'double life' as a K-Pop fan?** (e.g. like Curator Sung in 'Her Private Life'?)
4. **What are some things you wish people (in general, those around you, etc.) understood about you as a K-pop fan?**
5. **If there was an ultimate platform that could help you keep updated with the K-Pop world (beyond just music), what would you like to see?**",1,1

Like when I was new to K-Pop years ago, my biases were 10-12 years older than me, and I'm used to having older biases. But now my current biases from the recent groups are younger than me. It's so weird, and I can't fathom the thought of becoming a 'noona' fan already, but it has begun. Still, no matter the age, I stan these talented rookies, seriously I'm loving these lineups! I can't wait to follow X1 on their 5 year journey :))",4,15

If we go further back, SNSD's first Japan tour was also incredible with their [Genie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZQKLfFsaGc) remix. As well as Super Juniors Super Show 4 with [Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpFSRQzwEv8&amp;t=2s).

I've been hit and miss with K-Pop that entire span, taking sometimes a few year breaks in-between and I DO like a goodly number of newer groups/releases. However, as a past-time after work, I've decided to go back and listen to as many groups/songs from yesteryear as I can. I've found that I...kinda...like it better? Nothing wrong with the newer stuff, I just feel like new gen is all about the flash, colors and pzazz. There is something just...simple and clean about older stuff. Cheesy? Most definitely, but in a refreshing way. Maybe even awkward. As reference, I've been watching live videos of Deux and been quite entertained. They are literally dancing all over the place and tend to almost run into each other every couple seconds. Am I alone in this? Who do you remember watching and/or miss? Any memories? Recommendations? Again, I've been around awhile and trying to re-introduce myself to the past.",1,7

105,2019-8-11,2019,8,11,1,cokdo2,Z-Pop Dream Project gives K-pop a global spin: Members of Z-Girls and Z-Boys hail from across Asia but are based in Korea,Blackhand82,1565455494," Although their style and choreography scream K-pop - think glittery makeup, colorful hair and synchronized dance moves - theres something remarkably different about groups Z-Girls and Z-Boys. They are based in Seoul, but the groups are made up entirely of non-Koreans and only sing songs in English.   


Collectively called the Z-Pop Dream Project, the two groups are the brainchild of entertainment producers from Korea and across the region hoping to create the next superstars of Asia.   


Ive gone overseas to hold K-pop concerts countless times over the years, but I found that there were aspects about K-pop that my global partners were tired of, said Z-Pop Dream Project co-founder Jun Kang at a press showcase also attended by Z-Girls and Z-Boys held in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Thursday. Kang serves as CEO of Zenith Media Contents, an entertainment company, and claims to be an industry veteran with experience at SM Entertainment, Koreas largest management agency.   


We worked with professionals in the K-pop industry and discovered stars all across Asia. Our goal was to create a K-pop project based on cultural exchanges with many countries, said Kang.  


Z-Boys and Z-Girls each include seven members hailing from different regions: the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Taiwan and Japan. All of them were born in or after 1995, making them part of Generation Z, the demographic the project is targeting.   


The two groups officially debuted this February when they held their first concert Z-POP Dream Live at Jamsil Stadium in southern Seoul, upon releasing their first joint single Z-POP DREAM.  

 Since their debut, the groups have amassed a considerable fan base through multiple TV and press appearances throughout Asia. Ahead of their Seoul showcase, the groups met up with fans and reporters in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines and performed during the semifinal round of The Voice Indonesia. The YouTube video of that performance has garnered over 1 million views, and the official music videos of their tracks Holla Holla and Streets of Gold, released last week, have 1.7 million and 2.4 million views, respectively.  


Creating a completely multicultural K-pop group wasnt easy, Kang admitted.   


There are many aspects that we lack compared to \[other\] K-pop \[acts\], and we faced a lot of language barriers in training and creating the group.   


Although many of the members speak considerable Korean - Z-Girls Taiwanese member Joanne and Indian member Priyanka answered reporters questions in near-fluent Korean - the challenges continue. Ironically, its Korea where the group faces some of its biggest barriers.   


We really want to appear on Korean TV music programs, but the barriers for entry are too high, Kang lamented. Ive been working in the industry for 30 years and have many connections, but music shows tell us that they want K-pop and Korean songs and that our groups dont fit in.   


I disagree with what they say, Kang continued. If in other countries, television shows broadcast people of diverse cultures, why must we sing only Korean songs here?   


If the members felt stressed about the challenges they face, they certainly didnt show it during the showcase on Thursday, their first for Korean press. On Thursday, both Z-Girls and Z-Boys were all smiles, enthusiastically performing tracks from their new single and talking about their favorite K-pop stars like U-Know Yunho from TVXQ and Taeyeon from Girls Generation.   


The producers have even greater ambitions for the future. They are already planning to form multicultural boy and girl groups every year, expanding the range of regions the members represent. Also, they plan to use an Ethereum-based digital coin to facilitate purchases like concert tickets and merchandise.  


Z-pop started with the goal of giving hope and dreams to young audiences, Kang said. We tell the members in our groups that they are representatives of their country and that they can return to their homes and teach younger generations the techniques they learned from Korea.",0,1

Them performing Go up.

I think shes absolutely gorgeous, which contributes to her popularity. But honestly vocal and dance wise, shes kind of mediocre to me. 

I thought birthday wasnt a great song. It was catchy in a weird, bubblegum pop sort of way. Plus, although I know its not her fault, her outfits were disastrous.

Compared to somi, I really love chungha. I absolutely adore her. She has everything - the vocals, the dance skills, the stage presence. All of her songs so far have been absolute bops and they are so powerful and they match her image. Not to mention that all her outfits are amazing too. And chungha is from a relatively small company while somi is from yg!

I thought somi was better off in ioi, and I honestly think shes overrated. But this is just my opinion, and Im definitely not trying to hate on her.",21,80

Based on many resources there from the cosmos. 
Here comes the heroes - DAVID . 

Plot: 
A dark force lingers in the sci-fi and mythical world of K-Pop, as chosen guardians are anointed the powers of nature to save the earth and the future of Kpop from  a  dark smoked being from the cosmos. This villain is also rumored to be a Marvel Villain. 


With the success of A L E X  , there will be a full team of heroic guardians. They will each have solos then meet up and each music video is presented as a film. 

After Alex is Baekho. 

Meet DAVID or alternative name the power of DAVID. Alex Kinchen a rookie K-pop singer who havent debut since his predebut in 2009-10. Will debut with his first mini album ; BROKEN PROMISES also known as Fire and Heart  As we learned Alexs fandom is called Roosters and Cranes and Davids is Stars. 

David from DKDKTV.news mentioned a
Similar Concept for Super M, very ironic how that is so when this plot was secretly and public released weeks or month ago. 


Hopefully Alex dose the disappoint.

While browsing Reddit and YouTube, and having heard about all of the toxicity on Twitter and probably Instagram and Snapchat and all over Social Media in general it has become a common misconception that K-Pop fans are crazy, overly obsessive, rude, toxic, and downright insufferable by society, inside AND outside of social media. While this may be due to the overall rise in popularity it has been receiving as it spreads more and more and non-fans are just starting to take notice of it once again or are being introduced to it for the very first time, I think it is our responsibility to represent the K-Pop fandom as a whole in order to help it's rise in popularity become something that's internationally ACCEPTED and not DISGRACED or hated upon simply because of the fandom it possesses.",1,2

Would any of you find it strange to see an adult fan have their room decorated in kpop related merch? Growing up, I was moving in with so many different people so fast that I was never able to have my own bedroom that I could personalize, so now as an adult, its so important to have a bedroom that really makes me feel happy, comfortable and safe. I guess my biggest worry is having someone come over and see my bedroom, and thinking Im child-like for having kpop. Right now I only have my albums and a couple posters hidden behind a sliding closet door (so I can open the closet and have the posters covered if needed) but Im moving out soon and Im really worried about this.

&gt; oops, you're not invited

Excuse me? Was this a mistake? Was my invitation lost in the mail? Because I've checked the post offices. All of them. And they tell me to leave pretty promptly after I begin demanding they turn over my invitation to Somi's celestial birth celebration.

# But It Gets Worse

&gt; Everyday is my birthday

Bros. D-does this mean..... I'm unniinvited to EVERY day? All of them? I used the transitive property of sadness to determine that because I was unniinvited to her birthday and everyday is her birthday that Somi privileges have been revoked for all days and that's unniceptable. Because that's like.....a lot of days. With No. Somi.



How do I handle this? She's out there. Shaking it like it were her birthday. Every. Day. Probably as we speak, even. And I have no invitation.



Soobin would never have done this to me. I'm devastated. Help, bros.

Andrew from [Truly Daebak](https://www.youtube.com/trulydaebak) here, and welcome to the Monthly K-Pop Recap.

Normally at the end of each month, we peruse /r/kpop's Upcoming Releases List (lovingly maintained by /u/tastetherainbeau), compile a list of our favorite songs and comebacks of the month, and discuss it as part of our weekly DaebakCast YouTube show.

However this month ~~due to scheduling conflicts hehe~~ we've decided to switch things up and write out a post here on Reddit. You can watch our Top 10 songs of the month video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwlbXS_QLco&amp;feature=youtu.be), and you can also check out [Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak](https://Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak), where you can also find our [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlTXLeq0IcwsnWQ7kZs2d_lnNNl0vestK) of all the songs covered in this post. Otherwise, let's get started!

(Hint: Click the Artist/Song Titles to see the MV, and click the  icon to see a screencap)

# August 1st

[**D1CE -** ***Wake Up***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo3A9QSVdrI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/TuMoXP0.png)

This brand new five member boy group making their debut has former Produce 101 Season 2 contestants, and the 1st place winner from MixNine. This super hype Hip Hop/EDM boy group anthem is a pretty solid first outing, and fans of groups like Monsta X and Stray Kids are sure to enjoy this.

# August 2nd

[**Tiffany Young -** ***Magnetic Moon***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_t7Y8gBwU&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/2yDsWgI.png)

Released in anticipation of her North American tour of the same name, ""Magnetic Moon"" is Tiffany Young's 4th single of this year.

Despite featuring a striking visual aesthetic, and Tiffany's own brand of classy yet sensual outfits, the song itself has received a bit of a mixed reception from fans, myself included, for it's generous amount of vocal processing, that muddies an otherwise good release.

It's been noted that this is a signature stylistic choice of the song's producer, Fernando Garibay, that draws from influences like Lady Gaga and Madonna, but for me it seems unnecessary, and ends up distracting away from the incredible vocal talent Tiffany already possesses.

[**Rockim -** ***Don't Give It Up***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D86oGAT9EXg&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Like it says on the title, some of the songs we'll cover on this list won't be either good or bad, just plain weird.

Weird is pretty much the only way to explain the MV for this song. Rockim, showcasing a raspy singing style alongside the foreboding, industrial rock sounding instrumentals, juxtaposes the music to footage of some crazy pro wrestling moves and uhh, for lack of better term...[gratuitous plot](https://i.imgur.com/UIgYsue.png).

What compelled Mr. Rockim to make such a decision??? We may never know. It certainly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, for better or worse.

[**Tur-v -** ***bbaji go***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6cXT61bE2Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/ZhSDa6P.png)

Continuing on the weird K-Pop train, Tur-v, a collaboration between comedic musical duo UV, and legendary 90s K-Pop group Turbo, blends the best sounds of early Korean pop music, trot, and eurobeat synths straight out of the Initial D sountrack.

Memeable as this song may be, it still manages to be an incredible vocal showcase for Kim Jong-kook, who these days is better known for his antics on Running Man than for his singing prowess.

# August 3rd

[**Choi Ye Geun -** ***Virtual World***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61I3iAHydc&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/VJtHvJs.png)

If this [album art](https://i.scdn.co/image/391e19b7d8bd8f46fa952e2d02ed91a230e0d23d) wasn't already enough of a dead giveaway, Choi Ye Geun's ""Virtual World"" pulls some heavy inspiration from 80s City Pop and Disco for its sound.

From the funky bassline to the vintage synth chords, this song is sure to please retro-fanatics, and city pop/future funk enthusiasts like myself.

[**Chung Ha -** ***At the end (Hotel Del Luna OST)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFBk05QGFI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/XnqUW6o.jpg)

Chung Ha is the latest singer to release music as part of the Hotel Del Luna soundtrack.

The tvN K-Drama, starring singer-songwriter extraordinaire IU, is already proving to be one of this season's most popular Korean dramas, and the accompanying OST may be one of the best we've seen in years, with female vocal powerhouses such as Taeyeon and Heize having contributed their talents.

Other notable Hotel Del Luna releases this month included, [***""See the stars""*** **by Red Velvet**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HABlP_2L384&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Can you hear me?""*** **by Ben**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ralf-WydvSs&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Done For Me""*** **by Punch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hmHeTpMHjg&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Love del Luna""*** **by Taeyong of NCT &amp; Punch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVz8HZqzVU&amp;feature=youtu.be), and [***""Our Happy Ending""*** **by IU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVzbknPjmoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Would you be interested in a Hotel Del Luna soundtrack review, or a review of the entire K-Drama itself? Leave us a comment to let us know!

[**Pink Noise -** ***Smile Man***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RtrFxuzs2g&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/vVYoAlu.png)

One of the most interesting stories to come out of this month, ""Smile Man"" by Korean producer Pink Noise is an unreleased demo song intended for OH MY GIRL, with guide vocals performed by Chuu from Loona, prior to her debut.

Idols providing guide vocals is fairly common, but rarely does the general public ever get to hear the unfinished demos, so be sure to check out this rare peek into Chuu's pre-debut music history.

# August 4th

[**My Name Is Red-Haired Anne -** ***I'M JUST ME***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DStaXxsMkvo&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/oeX9Dnv.png)

Yes, that really is the actual name of this artist.

Complimenting the fairly unique stage name, it's only fitting that ""I'M JUST ME"" sports a moody electropop instrumental, reminiscent of Billie Eilish, on top of it's stylized music video, which incorporates real life footage, painted over with an eyecatching art style.

# August 5th

[**OH MY GIRL -** ***BUNGEE***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTD_yleCK9Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/cq5ZyYO.png)

Released as part of a repackage for THE FIFTH SEASON, ""BUNGEE"" is a return to the catchy upbeat style that we saw with Liar Liar, Coloring Book, and Remember Me.

Even as someone that gets easily jaded by these type of girl group songs, there's absolutely no resisting OH MY GIRL's brand of fun and cuteness.

[**SEVENTEEN -** ***HIT***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9CrRG6j2SM&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/s1VG36B.png)

Seventeen continues their banner year in 2019 with ""HIT"".

A slight reprieve from the EDM and Hip Hop influenced music on their previous album ""You Made My Dawn"", this song is a ""hype levels through the roof"" high energy dance track, complete with the the clean and intricate choreography that they've become known for.

They've certainly cemented themselves as a front runner for Best K-Pop Artist, and I'm excited to see what they'll have for us before the end of the year.

[**PinkFantasy -** ***FANTASY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfjpUTt9PJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/aDNhIIx.png)

PinkFantasy takes a page out of the Dreamcatcher playbook with this latest single.

Gothic rock style music feels right at home with the visually dark concept the group was already going, and adds another layer of intrigue to a group with a member permanently hidden under a Bunny mask.

[**CSVC -** ***SUMMER LOVE***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5fGpFwqeq8&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/SzpNVs2.png)

A project girl group made up of female solo artists, including CHEEZE, Stella Jang, Lovey, and Park Moonchi, CSVC's ""Summer Love"" is an homage to the style and music of 90s Korean Girl Groups like S.E.S and FinKL.

From the soft vocals, bright synths, and a Hip Hop breakdown filled with DJ scratching, pretty much everything about this song oozes authenticity and nostalgia.

# August 6th

[**FANATICS -** ***SUNDAY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC_-T581Dbs&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/njvHjIF.png)

After FANATICS-FLAVOR released their pre-debut song ""Milkshake"", we now get the debut of the full 6 member lineup, including Chaelin from Produce 101 S1, and Doah from Produce 48.

If you'd like to hear our full thoughts on this song and the rest of their mini album ""THE SIX"", you can check out our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9sbycJ35s&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**Dynamicduo -** ***Blue (Feat. Crush, SOLE)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYecF5RUU7k&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/YGyyvWk.png)

Dynamicduo are known to have some of the best features, and the trend continues here with newly signed P NATION artist Crush, and SOLE, a female soloist produced by Devine Channel.

This chill hip hop track definitely takes on some of its guests influences, with Crush proving his reliability on the hook, and SOLE's unique singing voice, definitely proving she deserved more than just one verse.

# August 7th

[**Rocket Punch -** ***BIM BAM BUM***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUOeg1LYF7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/FXBO0l5.png)

Featuring a line up of former Produce 48 contestants Kim Suyun and Kim Sohee, as well as former AKB48 Team B Captain Takahashi Juri, it's safe to say that Rocket Punch came into 2019 as one of the most highly anticipated girl group debuts.

You can see the full review of their debut mini album ""PINK PUNCH"" in our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeB3ld-Ve-8&amp;feature=youtu.be).

# August 8th

[**FANXY CHILD -** ***Y***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2qQCqRSZs) [](https://i.imgur.com/DARgB4B.png)

The 6-man Hip Hop/R&amp;B collective including Zico, Crush, Dean, Penomeco, DJ Millic, and producer Stay Tuned, are all back with this chill, trap beat infused digital single.

Directed by Hobin, the MV makes great use of light and dark contrast, leaving an impact just as strong as the music the visuals are accompanied to.

# August 9th

[**V (BTS) -** ***Winter Bear***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk7ESz6vtyA&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/RYjZs96.png)

A mellow acoustic guitar ballad that channels more Bon Iver or City &amp; Color than it does Bangtan, the BTS One Letter Wonder gives us some of his unique vocals, alongside quiet moments captured during BTS' recent world tour.

# August 13th

[**Weki Meki -** ***Tiki-Taka (99%)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgrOljOXdCQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/xTJS2LL.png)

Though sadly both this song and it's MV have nothing to do with [advanced Spanish football tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki-taka), it does however mark Weki Meki's first attempt at a summer comeback song.

To hear our full thoughts on Tiki Taka and the rest of Weki Meki's repackage album ""WEEK END LOL"" check out our DaebakCast video review [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvDPP2yOReo&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**PENTAGON -** ***HAPPINESS***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2Q5IfwA0c&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/B8ngpol.png)

Speaking of summer comebacks, PENTAGON's latest Japanese single ""HAPPINESS"" definitely falls under that same category.

New Jack Swing seems to be alive and well in 2019, and Pentagon combines this light-hearted track with, some trademark  summer beach scenes, and their enjoyably goofy choreography.

# August 14th

[**Robbin, 5Joo -** ***Let's Go To See The Flowers (feat. Ump)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHHBeCrTWQk&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/l1zS1BR.png)

Featuring softly sweet vocals, and synths straight from the Wii Shop Channel, ""Let's Go To See The Flowers"" might be one of the happiest sounding trap songs you'll hear all year.

[**Raiden -** ***The Only (Feat. Irene of Red Velvet)***](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nIONbXLkA1g&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/inOx0qs.png)

Raiden is a popular Korean EDM producer that has performed at venues such as Ultra Music Festival, and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Recently signing an exclusive contract with Big 3 music label SM Entertainment, he continues his collaborations with SM idols, first with ""Always Find You"" with SNSD's Yuri, and now with Red Velvet's Irene.

[**015B, Wyne -** ***Sweet, Melting &amp; Dangerous***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKa6cMiSEes&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/bAzVRW4.png)

Combining elements of indie rock, and a surprise trap breakdown, 015B's ""Sweet, Melting &amp; Dangerous"" continues to experiment with both their sound and concept with each and every singer they collaborate with.

Wyne's vocal performance is easily the highlight of this song, perfectly conveying the bittersweet and lamenting nature of the vocal melody.

# August 15th

[**SHAUN -** ***36.5***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEeZ-cQHJeo&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/MnJeKKZ.png)

SHAUN released a trio of MVs for the songs off his latest single album ""36.5"".

The title track features a fun upbeat latin inspired instrumental, complimented both by SHAUNs smooth vocals, and a nice female vocal harmony during the bridge, [""To Be Loved""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up4MdPH_RUU&amp;feature=youtu.be) has a funky bassline with chill R&amp;B key sections, and [""Moon""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQTmfhj7Zw&amp;feature=youtu.be) is a retro sounding pop ballad.

SHAUN's music has been hit or miss with me over the past few months, but really seems to be hitting his stride with the quality of these latest songs.

[**LIMHARA -** ***Mr. Green***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL0fcOo6ys4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/8NPNv5C.png)

A female vocal trio who released their first single earlier in 2019, are back this time with a soulful 70s throwback song, complete with Beegee's-esque vocal harmonies, jazzy saxaphone interludes, and an incredible trumpet solo that manages to steal the spotlight.

# August 16th

[**ANS -** ***Wonderland***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMBhehFpimI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/zzEniDc.png)

ANS' predebut summer track is one of the most interesting releases of the month.

The 5 member girl group, scheduled to debut later this year, had their MV released both on 1theK and the [official ANS Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOhT42cg6yk). However, the 1theK version had issues with the videos framerate appearing choppy and laggy, whereas the ANS Official version was fine.

First impressions are everything in K-Pop, and this technical error may have unfairly dealt a blow to ANS' debut hopes.

[**KIDZ BOP Kids -** ***Boy With Luv***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuSsLzORDTQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/AAe2Ltj.png)

If last month's Seoul Town Road by Lil Nas X &amp; RM didn't convince you that we live in a computer simulation, then this KIDZ BOP cover of BTS' ""Boy With Luv"" should do the trick.

Featuring lyrics sung entirely in Korean, and a dance cover video in the middle of Times Square, its' more and more proof that K-Pop has hit mainstream recognition here in the US.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go purge myself of this version before it gets permanently seared into my brain.

# August 19th

[**THE BOYZ -** ***D.D.D***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTTczRe-Pj0&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/JzI0xZ8.png)

THE BOYZ' 2nd come back of 2019, this MV features various scenes filmed in New York City during their US visit for KCON NY.

You can see our full review of ""D.D.D"" and the rest of the songs off their new mini album ""DREAMLIKE"" in our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViUNWuf6c4w&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**EVERGLOW -** ***Adios***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gX_p1VkgA4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/GiUFga6.png)

Continuing their non-English title trend, ""Adios"" is EVERGLOW's first comeback song.

Despite encountering visa issues that prevented them from attending both KCON NY and KCON LA, EVERGLOW continues to be one of the most popular new acts of 2019, with both Bon Bon Chocolat and Adios amassing 39 million and 46 million YouTube views respectively.

From my perspective however, Adios doesn't manage to hit the same level of quality that Bon Bon Chocolat reached back in March, mostly due to how the loud EDM drop style of this song simply feels derivative of BlackPink, but there are stil some parts I enjoy, like E:U's rap verse, and the high budget cinematography from the accompanying MV.

[**Red Velvet -** ***Umpah Umpah***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/2lBKpLy.png)

Following the onomatopoeia theme of ""ZIMZALABIM"", ""Umpah Umpah"" has fun upbeat vocals that match the bright, colorful, yet absurd MV, a staple of Red Velvet's concept over the years.

To hear our full thoughts on Umpah Umpah and the rest of The ReVe Festival Day 2, check out our DaebakCast video review [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU-vx1QAM4Q&amp;feature=youtu.be).

# August 20th

[**Celeb Five -** ***I wish I could unsee that***](https://youtu.be/p21n7yQX4uE) [](https://i.imgur.com/SF8HD2A.png)

A drastic change from their usual 80s throwback concept, this ""emotional"" ballad from the Queens of Comedy, Celeb Five, showcase some great vocals, elegant choreography and outfits, all with a sincerely moving narration, courtesy of Seolhyun from AOA.

[**AKB48 -** ***Sustainable***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pKfxbCHLoU&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/QR5ojS4.png)

Wondering what your favorite 48 Group members from Produce 48 are up to back in Japan? This list will cover AKB48 and all the sister groups from time to time.

Featuring familiar faces such as Muto Tomu, Matsui Jurina, Shiroma Miru, and Tanaka Miku, ""Sustainable"" is a throwback to the classic AKB48 sound that first made the group famous in the mid-to-late 2000s.

The MV features plenty of easter eggs and nods to previous AKB48 singles, as the girls put together a time capsule which outlines the history of AKB48, and the ""sustainable"" nature of the music they wish to leave behind.

# August 21st

[**IZ -** ***Final Kiss***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkzDPFV7oEw&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/XCjN6Ls.png)

In contrast to the fun and colorfulness of the MV, IZ's latest comeback song still has all the same heavy guitar riffs and loudness that the idol band have become well known for.

With their singles Eden, Hello, and now Final Kiss all releasing in 2019, IZ are certainly positioning themselves to be a dark horse candidate for Best K-Pop Band.

# August 22nd

[**UP10TION -** ***Your Gravity***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOo3fJ8lqbA&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/Kaj1aci.png)

While UP10TION may have lost Kim Wooseok to Produce boy group X1 for the next few years, they don't miss a beat whatsoever with this catchy dance track, and brightly pastel colored music video.

The group will only grow more in popularity once Wooseok returns, and they're certainly starting off on the right foot with a quality song like ""Your Gravity"".

# August 23rd

[**Sam Kim -** ***WHERE'S MY MONEY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INzd1VNEUuE&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/Nkz3gRy.png)

Former runner up on K-Pop Star Season 3, Sam Kim returns to his roots on this single, with his trademark bluesy guitar riffs, powerful vocals, and rapping sections that easily channel the likes of Ed Sheeran and Jason Mraz.

He continually proves to be one of the most talented performers in all of Korea, so be sure to check out the rest of his music if you enjoy ""WHERE'S MY MONEY"".

# August 25th

[**PigLipstick -** ***Dongle (Feat. Ritz)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoJdEMj4VQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/OQLFZ8g.png)

This debut track from PigLipstick pulls some disco influences with its guitar riff and bassline, as well as some future funk type production during the drop.

Add in the Korean Indie vocals, and this song ends up being one of the real hidden gem releases of this month. Definitely check this out if you're a fan of artists like Oohyo.

# August 26th

[**Jimin Park -** ***Stay Beautiful***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLZnNby97c) [](https://i.imgur.com/a73vUHR.png)

Jimin Park's last release under JYP Entertainment before leaving the company, ""Stay Beautiful"" might be her best work by far as a solo artist.

This magnum opus of trap R&amp;B, blues guitar, and future bass instrumentals feel right at home with her smooth vocal delivery.

Having often been under the public microscope for her appearance, there's no better person in the K-Pop landscape to release a song about having confidence, and a positive self image, than Jimin Park. (Be sure to check out the ['Jamie Ver'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9Vlj5HgAiw) of this song for an English rendition)

Her preaching most certainly goes into practice with this MV, having the confidence to sport a bold purple ombre and blonde hairstyle, with an outfit that leaves her many tattoos in full view.

Also making an unexpected appearance in the video are June &amp; Jung Jinwoo from the Hip Hop musical collective ""PLT"", which would make for an exciting musical collaboration in the future.

While Jamie leaving JYP after 7 years with the label may be bittersweet, she's definitely leaving her mark on the company with ""Stay Beautiful"". Both Jamie and her fellow 15&amp; bandmate Baek Yerin have earned my consideration for Best Female Solo Artist of the Year; the future seems brighter than ever for both singers.

# August 27th

[**the Night of Seokyo -** ***Story Line (Feat. Dawon)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6NupjOtMwI) [](https://i.imgur.com/UcKkjs4.png)

the Night of Seokyo are back again with mainstay collaborator Dawon for this latest single.

A slight departure from their usual style, ""Story Line"" trades in loud 80s synths, for some more subtle effects. This in addition to a Latin guitar section makes for a unique experimental sound that blends together elements of indie, electronic, and tropical music, anchored by Dawon's whisper-like vocal style.

[**PENIEL -** ***Flip (Feat. Beenzino)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USlrvoGQGEc&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/qe4Qdma.png)

""Guys like me we're like them holographic shadowless Pokemon cards, we rare"" is either the greatest English lyric ever used in Korean music, or the worst English lyric ever used in Korean music.

I'm still not sure.

[**X1 -** ***FLASH***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlQEKB2H7z4) [](https://i.imgur.com/zVH4TLp.png)

The hotly anticipated debut of Produce X 101's boy group, X1 looks to make their mark on the K-Pop industry with this energetic dance track, crafted nby members of K-Pop production powerhouse MonoTree.

To hear our full thoughts on FLASH and the rest of the songs on X1's debut mini album ""QUANTUM LEAP"", check out our newest episode of the ProduceCast.

The video review is scheduled to release on Sept. 5th, so be sure to subscribe to [Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak](https://Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak) so you don't miss it.

[**SUNMI -** ***LALALAY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrggmyDhWBo) [](https://i.imgur.com/eVvVOM4.png)

SUNMI's 2nd comeback of 2019 continues her weird and wacky visual style, alongside her latin pop influenced sound that stretches back to 2017's ""Gashina"".

Despite the visuals being on par with her previous release ""Noir"", I feel the quality of production and overall interesting vocal elements falls just short.

Sunmi certainly has one of the most unique styles in K-Pop, and her musical ambition can be greater than some of her contemporaries, but at least for my own liking, this is just a song that doesn't resonate with my particular taste in music.

[**GIRLKIND XJR -** ***MONEY TALK***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sPT5wJxnn4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/DsPeQid.png)

Members Xeheun and JK headline GIRLKIND's first ever subunit, XJR.

Unfortunately, this attempt at an American style trap song ends up with production quality that's all over the place. From poorly leveled vocals, to a beat that attempts to simultaneously sample every popular American Top 40s hit of the past few years, ""MONEY TALK"" is yet another microcosm of Next Level Entertainment's numerous attempts in getting this group into the limelight.

Everything, including the concept, the music, the choreography, the styling, and the cinematography, everything needs to improve for GIRLKIND as a whole, for them to survive past their two year anniversary in January of 2020.

[**Fanxy Red -** ***T.O.P***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz3UhwFPYg) [](https://i.imgur.com/aJZ7pxI.png)

This 4 member Chinese group, formerly known as Acrush or FFC-Acrush, are making their first move into the Korean market with the new single ""T.O.P"".

Originally making headlines back in [2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/entertainment/china-acrush-boy-band-androgny/index.html), Fanxy Red's androgynous concept, which features an all female lineup, styled and presented in the same vein as male idol groups, is one of the more unique ideas to come to market.

Despite the nonconformity to tradition, Fanxy Red has attracted a significant fanbase, with over 150,000 followers on Chinese social media site Weibo.

This attempt to break into the K-Pop space makes sense to help reach a wider audience, but maintaining a following in an already saturated musical landscape will be enough of a challenge for a group with no native Korean members, on top of having a gender-neutral vision that flies in the face of established idol concepts and mores.

[**Crush -** ***NAPPA***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoMIAo0a2TA) [](https://i.imgur.com/X3i14v8.png)

His first release under PSY's newly established P NATION music label, Crush's ""NAPPA"" is a trademark melancholy R&amp;B track.

The music video plays into this well, with Crush seemingly guilt ridden and without motivation after stealing someones bike in the middle of LA, making light of the deeper romantic strife at the heart of his lyrics.

Crush's creativity in both songwriting and visual accompaniment has always been his greatest strength, and it looks to flourish even more at his new home in P NATION.

[**SUMIN -** ***Love Is Strange (feat. Qim Isle)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NqFPVMTJjI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/ffywLr9.png)

Part of the Onstage Digging Club Seoul project, this remake of a [1987 song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZs8SHbMlaw) by Korean artist NAMI is almost unrecognizable in all aspects.

What originally was a happy-go lucky 80s synth pop track, now sports SUMIN's own brand of trippy and experimental R&amp;B.

The MV lives up to this notion as well, featuring retro-futuristic, iridescent clad ballerinas, a recreation of the moon landing, and a nightmare-inducing CG human/fly/mermaid hybrid.

SUMIN spared no efforts to make this song her own, and continues to be one of the most avant-garde artists in Korean music today.

I'm curious if others feel the same way. What would your dream K-pop podcast include? I think mine would focus on a different group every episode, like it could talk about well-known groups in a fun way but also introduce groups that people may not know as well. Or maybe each episode could be like a syllabus/greatest hits thing where they go through the best that each group has done on stage, on various albums, behind the scenes; stuff like that. Maybe give out awards to members for different things, like Most Fashionable; Best Dancer; stuff like that? idk, I love that kind of thing!

Also.... I know it would be too controversial but as a huge multi I would love to listen to a debate style podcast where two hosts compare similar groups and go back and forth about who has better discography, MVs, performances, styling, variety show appearances, etc etc. and then land on a winner at the end. People may complain too much but I love basically every group out there and I would love to hear two people trying to figure out who is better at what kinds of things.

I feel like this girls deserve way more views than just 5,479 their song might annoy you at the start but after a week I started singing it over and over and I feel it has so much more potential would love to hear your opinions on this group.

and if you ended falling in love with them share their music and help them get the recognition they deserve.

Hands down one of my absolute favourite things about kpop is the choreographies. Whether its just watching them or learning them, I really enjoy almost being a part of the music.
So my question is, what are some of the most original and impactful choreographies youve seen? Basically anything that was really different and maybe even groundbreaking.
For example, the first thing that comes to mind for me is Cherry Bomb by NCT. The moves were so unlike anything I had seen before and I still think its so unique.

Please let me know so I can look them up and enjoy them in my free time ",22,7

54,2019-10-5,2019,10,5,20,ddm5c5,"I am a black 14 year old girl and my mother is on board with me working to become a trainee, what do I do next?",SkylorRose,1570275756,"Let me start this post with a couple of clarifications:

1. I am aware that the likeliness of me being accepted as a trainee is extremely low and the chances of me debuting are even lower, however, I might as well try.
2. I am currently learning Korean.
3. I do realize and understand the risks of being a trainee and idol.

Now that that is out of the way, I can start. After I got into Kpop, it wasn't long before I started learning some choreographies and of course, they're difficult but not too much so as I used to be a dancer a couple of years ago. However, as I started getting more invested in Kpop and South Korean culture in general, as well as starting to learn the language, I realized that I was becoming more interested in having a profession that involved Kpop. Ultimately, I've decided that I want to become an idol. Now, I know what you're thinking by now, the whole ""Oh, it's just a phase"" or ""There are plenty of children your age who dream of what you're dreaming of,"" and to that I say, fair enough. It is true that there are plenty of kids my age who want to do the same thingI'm trying to do, and that's why I want to do it. I want to show them that it's possible albeit difficult. I want children and teens to see me one day and know that it's possible, and I'm willing to try and fail as many times as I need to. For example, Alexandra Reid. Of course, we know how that turned out and she was treated more as a token than anything else, but she showed me that it's possible to get up there, and if the right company with good intentions takes a chance on you, it could turn out well.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I told my mother that I wanted to become a Kpop idol and she told me that she supports it, and this weekend we'll look into what we can do. I've already begun to learn choreographies, change my diet and run. What should I be doing in the meantime? What next?

I hope I can post this here. 

I wrote a k-pop-inspired novel called, **Reminiscing**. I'll post a synopsis below. I'm not a self-published author, I have a publisher, but I'm trying to get my book out there because **I know** a lot of people will like it!

On top of that, I am hosting a K-pop giveaway to go along with it. You can find contest rules [HERE](https://tierrawritesromance.com/reminiscing-giveaway/).

**Synopsis:** 

https://i.redd.it/pm68tsj18yq31.jpg

 KyuBeom Yoon is known as the ice prince of the renowned K-pop group, C4. All he wanted was to get away from it allthe lights, the cameras, and the fame that comes with being an idol. And all he wants is Maya Campoy. With Maya, he gets the chance to feel normal, to be loved, to be happyand so much more. Unfortunately, things dont always go as planned. Years later, he finds himself on a radio show reliving a tale of love and heartbreak, wondering if, at the end of it all, shell give him another chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked pretty hard on this novel, and it's relatable and funny. It has 4/5 stars on Amazon and Goodreads so far!

#1:song releases
Blackpink seem like they drop an EP every now and then with pretty good songs but it's like starving yourself for a week and then proceeding to eat an average size meal at a fairly expensive restaurant yes the food was good but you're left wanting more but guess what? You have to wait an entire week more to eat again look all I'm saying is they need to be allowed to release music on a consistent basis and I'm not asking for an album every 1-2 months but at least 3-4 months would do quite well

Is it under the table along with all the other scand...you know what nevermind almost got carried away anyways look all we want is the solo songs cause the way things looking right now they're never coming out and that concerns me cause this goes back to the whole thing I was saying about the fancy restaurant what if they're good songs but dont be worth the wait  man

#3:potential 
Blackpink by how diverse all 4 members are have so much collab potential they could honestly record a song with asap rocky then turn around and record one with ariana grande but their label holds them back immensely,trust me they know it we all know its true

Maybe when their YG contract is up they'll decide to become independent artist cause that's the best route I think they can take considering just how talented they are cause in the end true genius knows no restraint

I have always found that Spotify is unfair with their 'This is XXX' playlists of TWICE and Red Velvet ('This is BLACKPINK' is fairly decent). So, I made this playlist with each of theirs top ten tracks sorted by popularity and slightly shuffled to give a fair chance for every track. This playlist automatically updates itself ten times every day. Hope this is useful for people who want to get into Kpop and long time listeners alike.

I am a director of a project called Orbital, which is a non-profit project focused on making a website for Orbits, by Orbits, or anyone interested in LOONA in general. Our goal is to create an environment that provides everything that fans want in one place! This includes articles, news, entertainment, events, information on voting, introductions to LOONA members, theories, and much more. We hope to continue to grow and improve upon these features by listening to the fandom and our trusted team.

The reason we are contacting Reddit is that, too develop the project further, we are looking for more volunteers who are interested in and willing to dedicate themselves to the project. Currently, we have the most need for members of the Tech department. We need those who have knowledge of React, Angular, and/or Vue.js. If you have other applicable knowledge, or think that you would be able to quickly and accurately learn any of these programs, please also consider helping out. 

If youre interested in working with Orbital please dont hesitate to fill out our [application form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6WbZKTnnCqZCJiQ9Ik1Xx_DhwuptyuqTLpS4pKdSGIHowMA/viewform) If you have any questions or doubts please feel free to contact us on our Twitter account ([@orbitalwebsite](https://twitter.com/OrbitalWebsite)) or feel free to DM me directly or comment down below. If youre not interested in working with Orbital but would like to follow the site and its progression please follow our Twitter!

I realize that not all of you are Orbits, which is completely fine! As long as you don't have a vetted interest in bashing LOONA that's all I ask. There are incredibly talented individuals across all kpop fandoms, and, honestly, I want to access as big as a pool of potential applicants as possible. 

I would like to thank the mods here for allowing me to do this bit of promotion, and thank you to all of you for your time!",2,16

This is a serious post. I genuinely want to know your thought process. Consider it curiousity &amp; enlightenment on my part. Your identity won't be revealed outside our interview. I will not take sides. No, I will not try and convince you to change your mind on anything. I just want to know about you, and why you're an anti.

You can decide whether or not you would like me to share the interview anywhere online - and your name will be censored.

This is a long shot but if you are reading this &amp; you do go out of your way to post negativity against celebs, do consider reaching out to me via private message. I'll keep the interview mature &amp; on track so long as you do me the same favour.

i've been into this shit for around 8 years. two of the most exciting years in kpop for me musically were the years 2012 and 2015, so i decided to waste my work shift curating a playlist for both of these years.

i should note that the 2012 playlist is missing 'I don't need a man' by Miss A and 'Stop Girl' by U-KISS. (the latter is one of my favorites from this year UGHH)

i'm also considering doing 2011 since that was also an exciting year (and the year i got into kpop!)

if you're a long time kpop fan like myself i hope you derive great pleasure from these playlists!

also i partly used the wikipedia page to pick these out so if i'm missing anything PLEASE let me know and i'll add it right away!!

Because of his love for K-pop, this was the theme he wants us to produce.

Our batch produced covers for #EXO, #TWICE, and #IOI. Links below 

Hope you guys enjoy~

For the IOI fans: One group in our batch produced a music video cover for ""Whatta Man""! This is the group that I participated in. Hehe~

For the ONCE out there: Another group produced a music video cover for ""What is Love?"" by TWICE! There's a big twist here: our precious nine girls are played by guys and it's really hard not to laugh for their acting.

   I grew up listening to anime op/endings while drawing. One day in the side bar of youtube suggestions the door to kpop opened and I fell into it hardcore. It was the whole bundle deal that I didn't even know I wanted in my life. It's been around 10 years. I still obsessively watch kpop. 

   This isn't some recent epiphany, but I have as of late been taking it more seriously. Kpop has pulled me away from my dear hobby drawing and years of seeing the model-esque members have negatively attributed to my self image etc. I remember in my first relationship I was irritable that I couldn't binge it like I used to and when we broke off I had so much free time that I felt lost cause I finally wasn't binging on kpop nor being clung to from my clingy ex. I became so productive and flourished. Now here I am fallen back into the addiction looking back missing the productive person. 

   I know any country's ent industry have this power over viewers no matter what generation even social media, but for me it's kpop. The kpop fanbase also is so persistent to try and push their favs and support them that I feel it's possibly naturally even more obsessive than others. 

TLDR: Do you feel kpop has had a negative effect in your life no matter how small?",0,3

**JYP is having a comeback**, I think would be cool if **ALL THE JYP'S ARTIST' FAN** could  stream his song or support him when it will come out, since he said in multiple interviews that he's the least important artist of his own company and that **nobody care about him as a artist anymore.**

Since **JYPE FANS are incredibly kind**, it would be really cool to support him, the **most views** on his **youtube** channel are **3,4Mln** views and on **his last song** ""Still alive"" just **8 Mln**,on his **twitter post** (about his comeback) **just 39 comments** and on **instagram just 400** .....**so sad**

Do you think is possible to ""make him feel special""?

I think it would be a cool group project,

63,2019-11-8,2019,11,8,17,dtcoph,IZ*ONE AND XI DOES'NT DESERVE THE HATE!,diannegandakpop,1573202981,"Maybe my opinion doesn't concern everyone but this is the only thing that I can do to help this amazing and talented people.

Everyone deserve to debut! They deserve to be appreciated, loved, and respect. Not only XI or Iz\*one but everyone who dream, who believe and everyone who work hard just to reach the place where they are right now. When I heard about the news about the backlash that they are receiving right now, I ask myself? those people who curse, who say bad things about them, are they happy? all the things that they said is enough to harass those kids? We are all the same! Yes! they are famous, but they are just like us. They are human being. They are just dreaming like all of us. When some famous died because of depression, all the bashers become the supporters as if they didn't call them b\*tch, sl\*t, and other hurtful words.

I watch Produce 101 since Season 1. I know how every trainee work hard just to debut. I know how they cried just because they can't dance. I know Sohye's struggle when she can't follow but their is Sejeong just to help her. I know how Chungha did'nt want to credit herself when she make the dance step in bang bang but their is Doyeon and Yoojung just to tell how Chungha help their group. I know the hardwork of Growl Team just to give the best dance. I even know how great Jeon Soyeon when she perform Turtle. Have about those haters? They even know that the most memorable dance evaluation is when THE POP TEAM perform the song of NSync. Then don't know that Kang Daniel was once left behind. That he becomes viral when he perform his famous hip dance and he becomes the Nations IT BOY. They also don't know that Ha Sungwoon becomes part of Top 11 at Episode 10. They don't also know that Nu'est is existing because they have gust to join Produce 101 even if they are sunbae who debuted 4 years ago. All the haters of Jpop arrived when the collaboration of produce and AKB happen. EXCUSE ME? Kpop or Jpop it does'nt matter because like what I've said, every people dream, every one work hard. SAKURA, HITOMI, NAKO, CHOWON, GAEUN, and every trainee from that season they are all family even if they can't understand each other. Everyone study each others culture just to understand each other. And I will not forgot my Produce X 101. They are all multitalented. My sassy Dongpyo who got the burden of debuting because he becomes the center of Produce song, but he got all the hate just because of his sassy attitude. My Han Seungwoo, Wooseok, Byungchan, Jinhyuk, Cho Seungwon, Hangyul and the other trainee who also have guts to join the PD even if they already debuted because they are also dreaming that MAYBE they can be like Nu'est. Kim Yonghan who left his career in Taekwondo because his dream is to become a Singer, A 3 month old trainee who has a rapid growth. And to all the trainee that join PD Series I salute them. Because they are all working hard to achieved their dream while their haters are just sitting on their chairs who can't even paid for their own underwear, still asking money from their parents just to buy all the things they want but they don't need.

Don't hate IZ\*ONE AND XI because it is not their fault. It is the fault of that M\*therf\*cker PD. Don't you dare hate my group, Don't you dare say hurtful words to my Inspiration. Don't harass every KPOP IDOL who are just dreaming. IN SHORT, if you don't stan some group just focus on your group. Buy their album and merch, stream their song so that they can win the award that they deserve not because they are rank 1 from fan vote.

I've been in kpop community since 2012, I already experience fanwars but not like the fanwars this days. Because us from my year, we become fans because of their stories, because of they talents not because they are famous and I want to be at the date. I become a fan because even if I cant understand their songs I can feel it. I cant afford to buy merch, album or lightstick because I am still young that time and I cannot afford it but I am still happy and I can that I am a solid fan because I appreciate everything that they do. SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STAN MY GROUP, NEVER EVER SAID BAD THINGS TO THEM. BECAUSE KARMA WILL STRIKE YOU.",2,1

1. Describe the way you are feeling today: Twit-Hwasa 

2. Describe your love life: Blow Your Mind- (G)-IDLE 

3. The meaning of life is?  Twenty-three - IU (Ha! Looks like Douglas Adams was wrong)

4. Describe your ex: L.I.E - EXID 

5. What would you say to your ultimate bias if you met them: Oh! My Mistake - April

6. The next big kpop scandal will involve: Someone Like U - DalShabet (well if it involved someone like me it would probably involve accidentally cursing or telling a dirty joke on TV)

7. What song would play at your funeral? 365 Fresh - Triple H (amazing and ironic at the same time, I approve)

8. What is your favorite way to spend your free time? Now or Never - SF9 

9. If you were an idol your fandoms name would be: Trouble Maker Troublemaker (sounds about right)

10. What is your goal for the future? What is Love? - Twice",12,1

There's a slew of scammers sending people fake proofs of PayPal transfers so the person thinks they've been paid and transfers the ticket only to later be blocked and never actually receive the money. I and a handful of other people were stolen from in this way. All I can say is don't get desperate even if you're just selling and wait for an actual email from PayPal that the money transferred before doing anything. And plz don't come at me for this I know I messed up. 

Anyway I was gathering info left and right about the scammer to file a police report. I figured out quite a bit about them. They were using throwaway accounts, emails, the works. And then I found them selling my stolen ticket on Twitter on a selling account. I outed them to a buy/sell/trade group on Facebook and multiple people started messaging them and calling them out. Apparently the scammer felt bad because they decided to return the tickets they stole as long as I clarified that the selling account as a whole wasn't a scam. So.....we Jopping?",0,1

I only remember the music video. It is sung by, I think a male and female co ed kpop group (it might be jpop idk)))and this particular song features another male Asian rapper. 

The music video is video game themed. 

The music video starts with a bunch of people in a white room watching a TV. It zooms into the TV and shows the singers in a pixelised form. It then proceeds to have the real life singers and it plays out a story, where the girl loses her heart's (displayed at the top of the screen)  as the male flirtS with other girls. It then cuts to the featuring male rapper and they're like all dancing and then the video ends with it zooming back out from the TV to the white room. 
The video is really unique and colourful 

The main hook of the song is literally 'nananananana ' here's the chorus https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/song/4726296238096384 (sorry for the whack tempo)",1,1

Note: I had no prior dance lessons before this, I was completely blown away by how difficult this was. I commend anyone that dances as a career or hobby and recommend people who are interested to give it a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

K-Pop Sundae is a podcast that discusses K-Pop topics. For about two years, we have been researching and making daily posts about older (or forgotten) K-Pop on [Tumblr](https://kpopotd2.tumblr.com/), but we recently decided to start a podcast. We release two episodes per month: the first episode is a discussion about our opinions on a topic and the second leans into being informative. For example, in October we talked about how people discover K-Pop by diving into the history of how it spread, what factors led to the rise in popularity of K-Pop, and how people continue to discover it.

&amp;#x200B;

If that interests you, you can find us (for now) on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7lurDG0O58V1YDp8S3RNCU), [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kpop-sundae/id1482567030), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-418160549).",2,1

Yes, the issues can be big and hard for us to solve but we can do something, just like we send memes and jokes and experiences let's try and use this mediatic world we live in to send love and support to the humans that makes us happy, support and love are always need it so go and give love as much as you can to the ones you love and to yourself. I don't know all of you, I don't know all the idols but I know that we all matter and we all deserve to be loved.

I am attempting to make a video regarding the band Se So Neon and their front women So Yoon. The video would be a brief summary of where they came from, how they came to be, the different tours or accolades they achieved, and why I humbly consider them to be among one of the most successful Korean groups. The only problem is that most of the articles or interviews that answer such questions are in Korean. (I cannot read Korean)

I'd greatly appreciate it If anyone would be so kind as to help contribute any information found about them to this thread. Of coarse I will credit you as an individual in my video!

I'm older than the A.C.E boys, so in theory I don't have to use polite language. However, just walking up to them and using banmal seems rude.
