As you guys probably have some idea of, the K-Pop song contest voting is already underway, and looking at the brackets, VERY EARLY competition to IU is present even in this first and second round:

1st Round:

IU vs Hello Venus, BEAST, Ailee and Secret

2nd Round:

IU vs 2x SNSD and 2x PSY

While I do not doubt that IU can win in the 1st Round, getting a win vs SNSD is the best chance for IU to progress to later rounds, especially given that SNSD's songs are their stronger ones. Every End of the Day just deserves to go down to Gangnam Style; while Mia, well, it depends if it wins against Fiction.

[IU - Don't like her, Remocon (2012.10.17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPhzjSSAyo)

[IU - I'd Do It All Again, KBS Sketchbook (2011.03.11)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV5TwP-Sgwc)

Doesn't hurt that they're recorded so well either. Now if only she would perform some of her lesser know songs. (4am, A Stray Puppy etc.)

IU APPEARED IN A MOVIE AND I DIDNT WATCH IT? AND HOW IS IT THAT I ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS NOW. This cannot be. Well the movie poster itself was questionable but i was like, heck it. google cant be wrong.... right? So like any other uaena, i watched the movie. Halfway through there was no appearance of IU and no indication of such. On top of that, the movie wasn't the kind of movie an idol will star in. So i skipped to the credits and realised there is a child actress in the show named Lee Jieun. ahhhh. it all made sense now. it was quite a good movie so i finished it. is there any way of correcting google of this mistake?

tldr: google thinks that child actress named Lee Jieun in 'Bedevilled 2010' is IU. anyway to correct google?",2,0

3,2015-11-6,2015,11,6,18,3rqwaq,[Discussion] Lyric Interpretation -- Zeze,HanabiOAgeruNo,1446803740,"I'm sure we've all seen the multitude of posts about angry 'netizens' regarding this song... but I thought it might be fun to explore the opinions of people who put forth the time and effort to actually try to understand the song in some way.



I'll go first:

For starters, the book is essentially about a child who goes through suffering and finds comfort in a relationship with a tree. There is a lot more to it than that obviously, but the point is, Zeze is a very relatable character (hence the success of the book). Anyone who has ever experienced some form of suffering (aka everyone on earth) can relate in some way to Zeze's struggles. Even if they have never literally been beaten to within an inch of their life, they can still understand and relate to his struggles in the context of the difficulties they have experienced in their own lives.

A big part of the artistry in this song comes from the abstraction of Zeze's struggle to something very different and much less obviously challenging.

My hypothesis is:

    Zeze = IU, the Tree = Korean public/fans

I thought this was an interesting and fitting perspective for reading the lyrics. The song becomes a commentary on social expectations of young women in the kpop industry, or, more generally, the public eye.

 Some explanation of this view:

* The first verse sounds like adults enjoying watching a child play. Like a grandmother watching kids at the park. It has a very innocent and happy/calm feel to it. I think this verse could represent the initial fascination that the public had in IU in her early days as a young idol.
* ""Singing of colors and sights in your ticklish voice"" -- ticklish voice immediately brings IU to mind for me while colors and sights makes me think of an older person listening to a child who is still joyfully fascinated by the world.
* In the chorus we have the public inviting IU onto the path to fame where they will support her.
* ""Climb up the tree, take the youngest leaf, take the only flower"" -- The public offer her the chance to 'climb to the top' of the industry where they will support her and she will have access to the finer things in life.
* ""Don't fool around, don't hurt the tree, bad bad"" -- sounds like a metaphor for the negative effects idols face when caught up in things like dating 'scandals.' Of course, you could go more abstract with it and just say anything that the fans don't like, but considering this is IU I think the dating connection is probably relevant. 
* The second verse sounds like the public opinion of her starts to shift a little. She is still viewed as innocent and childlike, but people are starting to suspect that her innocence may be an act which hides her true self.
* ""You've got sunshine over your head, but the glimpse of your inside is covered in dark clouds""
* The second chorus in this context implies the willingness of the public to continue to support her, despite the doubts that have arisen. But, they again warn her ""don't hurt the tree.""
* The bridge gets interesting in that it sounds like the public have developed wild expectations and an infatuation for her. Every line in this part feels like it would come from a 'stan' who feels entitled to her attention. This mentality of 'I made you, now you owe me' from the public. She is now feeling controlled and restricted by her career and reliance on fans.
* ""I wait for you here every day, come get it all (take it x3)"" -- Overly devoted and entitled fans have become demanding and now are giving her orders on how to behave and how she should live her life. 
* The lyrics of the final chorus are the same, but the context is now different. She isn't a wide-eyed child anymore. She is an adult who wants to make her own decisions and live life her own way, but the fans are still pushing her toward the same old goal of innocence, purity and fame.


What I think is the coolest part of this possible interpretation is the fact that she is taking on the role of the public and sings to herself. There is just something very artistic and interesting in that to me.

Anway, I'd love to read other interpretations of this song and see what else we can find.

**Note1:** to me, people complaining about Zeze's *""sexualization""* sound like a kid walking by the [statue of david](http://www.enkivillage.com/s/upload/images/2014/11/95bc52306050233ce5694a3a58f98c10.jpg) and complaining about him not wearing pants...

6,2015-11-22,2015,11,22,12,3trxi0,[Interview] GQ Korea Dec 2015 - Woman of the Year,winterlane,1448164519,"**Shall we announce it? From the drama The Producers, to Leon on Infinity Challenge, to the album CHAT-SHIRE. 2015s Woman of the Year is IU.**

Wah, its an honour! This year has been a really hectic year.

**How was it? Although its still a bit too early to look back at 2015.**

Those were the days. Thats what someone told me recently. I agree with that. Later on in life, when I look back at all this, Ill think to myself, Those were the days The age of 23 can be seen as the early or mid-twenties, but anyway, you could still insist that its the end of the early-twenties. It really seems like the end of the early-twenties. As a 23-year-old, I think this year was more special than usual. I get the feeling a lot that Im really alive. The things I did turned out well too.

**To be specific, when did you feel like youre alive?**

When Im imagining, coming up with ideas, drawing up plans, I feel the most excited. This year, since the start of the year I had ideas and plans about doing a drama and acting. At a good timing, I was casted for The Producers, which was well-received. Also, whenever I finish a project, I feel a sense of emptiness. Just when I was feeling that way, Infinity Challenge came along. It was a really hectic and busy period and I had a good time. Then I thought, Ah, at this rate, this year is going to just pass by, lets do a spurt at the last minute. So I released my CHAT-SHIRE album. Just like that, I had a fulfilling year. Ive never done anything I didnt want to. I feel much better now that Ive done the things I wanted to do.

**Do you feel that your acting is starting to change as well?**

Thats not something I felt while watching my recent dramas, but rather, when I look back at those I acted in previously, I think to myself, Wah, I was really inexperienced then. For The Producers, it was a drama crafted based on my own life story, so it turned out to be quite natural. They werent emotions that were totally foreign to me and there were parts that I went, Oh, I felt that way too. So it was interesting and there were many parts I could identify with. I felt great that I received a lot of compliments. I was really happy.

**During your promotions, youre filled with schedules then they empty out again, so I think youll keep having this feeling of emptiness. How do you deal with these ups and downs? Do you just let go entirely and leave it, or do you get out there and do something?**

When I feel empty, I quickly think of my next step. I dont think thats a good method, but its the easiest way to get out from that state.

**Why dont you think its a good method?**
 
Theres a reason for all kinds of emotions, right? I think we need to give ourselves some time to focus more and embrace those emotions. Being like I cant take this, I want to do another crazy schedule right away, in the end it wont be good for my health.

**You need enough time to digest those emotions too. Anyway, if you keep it all in, at some point in time, theyll come gushing to you all at once.**

That was the case for me last year. I released many online tracks, but didnt have any promotions. So I had a lot of alone time and a lot of time to reflect. All my feelings from promoting for the past 7 years came to me at once. I felt really empty and tired.

**How did you get over it then?**

I just spent it like that. I felt lost and since I didnt have schedules, I didnt have the chance to hint at the fact that IU is feeling really empty and gloomy right now. Fans who dont follow me very closely wouldnt have noticed. Compared to that, this year my blood was flowing really quickly and I was really excited. Thats why I felt this is the feeling of being alive.

**Through this album, I think we finally get to meet  (the real) IU. Many people say that, IU is singer with emotions more matured than her age right? If the Flower Bookmark allowed that side of you to be exposed, I think in the CHAT-SHIRE album, you were just being IU.**

Its probably since I wrote the lyrics right? Flower Bookmark was an album that I tried hard to understand the lyrics of classic songs and recorded them in my own voice. In this album, the words I wrote precede my voice, so I think it was much more realistic in giving people the feeling, So the girl called IU is this sort of girl.

**Does it feel different when you sing the songs you wrote the lyrics to?**

I dont think theres a big difference. When I write lyrics, I just write, but this is totally different from singing the song. Just because they are lyrics I wrote, it doesnt make the song easier to sing. Sometimes it makes the song harder instead. There are times when I wrote a line of something I really wanted to say, but the pronunciation makes it more difficult. During those moments, its difficult for me to come to a consensus with myself. If I change it to another sentence, its different from what Im thinking, so lets go ahead with this. Thats from the perspective of lyricist IU. But the singer IU feels this way. But the pronunciation here is awkward and it doesnt sound nice when you sing it out. Thats when I feel ambivalent.

**There are some lyrics I like. In Twenty-three, I never wrote even a single line of lies, as well as Can I be on the top of your head? The lyrics in Knees as well. Even if I lightly fall asleep from the touch of your hands / let me stay in that position for a moment / Ill sleep really deeply. The part joheun songil (touch of your hands) sounds really pleasant to the years. It seems like a song about forever not being able to return to the days that one felt harmless and secure.**

Its true that we cant return to those days. Even if you bring the person to you and lie on her lap now, its no longer like before. Those knees are not what is important, but those days, as you start to miss everything about it.

**Which period of time comes to your mind?**

Its about the days when I was really young. As Knees is a song about insomnia. A time when I didnt have to worry about not being able to fall asleep. Isnt falling asleep something natural? Just like the sun setting and moon appearing, a time when I didnt have to worry at all. Isnt that a time we want to return to? Being able to fall asleep the moment we close our eyes. I thought of my grandmas lap when I wrote this song. My grandma was beautiful and healthy and I could lie on her lap anytime, but I cant turn back time.

**Do you have sleepless nights?**

I do. But Ive gotten through them.

**Are you able to enjoy those nights?**

It would be a lie to go so far (as to say I enjoy those sleepless nights). 

**How many hours do you sleep a day?**

It differs a lot from day to day. On days that Im really tired, I just sleep. But usually, to fall asleep, I have to try hard to do so. It feels unfair that I have to try hard to go to sleep. Sleeping is something were born to be able to do. When were hungry, we eat, when were full we put down our spoon. I was born with this sort of basic human abilities. These are basic items I was born with. But as I grew up, like a fool, I seem to have lost these, my basic items. Usually you develop these basic items into real items in life, yet I even lose my basic items. Seeing myself trying hard to find those basic items for myself again, I seem like a fool and I feel frustrated. Thats a song I wrote on a day I felt really frustrated.

**Looking back, at the age of 23, I was struggling with and trying to find my own identity. How about I ask you What kind of person is 23-year-old IU? with a straight face?**

Everytime I get this question, I seem to answer it differently. To me, Im no different from any other person. Theres nothing special about me. Im not someone who holds steadfast to my values or beliefs in life. Depending on the situation, in the turn of a hand, Im the kind of person to turn everything inside out. Its hard to describe myself in a word. Since I might change in the next minute. Yes, Im this sort of person.

**Why do you think people keep saying that youre mature? To be rich with emotions and to be mature are two different things, but people tend to mix them up. If youre rich with emotions, your range of understanding is wider and its common to be described as mature. Have you ever felt curious about that?**

I just go, Ah, I see. I dont see myself as a mature person. Some parts of me are more developed than others, but some parts of me havent developed fully yet. Each of us are different in some ways, but when people go, oh, shes rather mature, thats because that part of me they have in mind is more developed. Thats what I think.

**Dont you get annoyed when people describe you as something youre not?**

It would be a lie if I say I dont feel that way at all, but graudally, I dont feel that way so much anymore. My way of thinking has changed. Could it be considered a misunderstanding? I mean, If the person sees me that way, then let it be. I listen to what people say at both extreme ends. I guess thats the same for other celebrities. Since theres only one of me and so many people perceiving me in different ways.

**Have you ever heard someone say such things to you directly (describing you as something youre not)?**

Someone told me that he/she likes me. Reason being Im clever in the way I behave. Because Im clever and shrewd. The person likes me because Im shrewd. Then someone else would say they like me. Reason being I dont think too deeply and just say what I think. Then someone would say they dont like me. Because Im shrewd and manipulative. Then someone else would say they dont like me because Im dumb. So actually theres no way for good and bad points to be in sync. I have no choice but to simply acknowledge that all of that seems to be me. If I want everyone to like me, how should I behave? Thats impossible, isnt it?

**Have you perhaps read your past interviews before?**

If I happen to come across past interviews, sometimes they feel really strange and unfamiliar to me. Oh, I thought that way? So Im always careful about what I say in interviews. Thats the way it was when it was recorded then, but a few days later, I might think completely differently. Leaving a record can be a scary thing.

**In 2010, you did an interview with GQ magazine at the age of 18. We asked you then, When do you feel at ease?**

Haha I dont remember.

**You replied then, Well, maybe if I go past the age of 20?**

Thats right! Haha. Thats really, ah, thats funny. Gosh, I said I would feel more at ease when I go past the age of 20? Gosh, I was such a kid.. Thats how I felt then. Wah.

**The last question was, Are you going to stick only to stage (performances)? and you replied then, Ah, I thought of something else. The dark blue sky when the sun sets and just before it turns completely dark. The night sky at around 8:30pm these days. When I see that, my heart opens widely. Thats how acoustic music feels to me too.**

Thats really similar. Im still like that.

**Wed like to ask you a bit more. What do you do to be able to have time for that? Because to be able to watch the sky at a time we like best, theres usually some effort required.**
 
These days, time flies without me knowing I think thats for the best. I have a stronger feeling of boredom than others. Im the kind thats desensitised to stimulation. Be it something dangerous, something physically dangerous too, Im not very sensitive to it. Even circumstances whereby its obvious Im going to get into an accident, or when Im going to get injured, the people around me would be really shocked, but I would be less shocked. So Ive never felt Thats super fun! I dont have any hobby either.

**Its unexpected that you dont have a hobby.**

Most of the time, the day feels really long to me. Gosh, I slept in and woke up at 1pm, Ive done this and that now, but its not even 3pm yet Ive often spent my days like that. But sometimes, without me knowing, a whole 6 hours can just pass by. I feel really good then. I really love times like that.

**What were you doing that time passed by so quickly?**

Usually when Im composing songs, time passes by so quickly. When Im focused, it seems time just passes by quickly. But theres not many things that I love doing as much as the level of focus I give them. I really dont havea hobby, haha. I thought I would have one as I grew older. I thought I would have one once I passed the age of 20, but I dont seem to have one.

**Isnt a hobby something you do to get rid of stress? Even things like going for walks.**

It doesnt really accumulate much though. I see it as both a positive and negative thing about me. It just vanishes right away. The bad, the good and my memories too.

**Do you still write in your diary? Daily?**

I started writing since my 2nd year in middle school, so its my 9th year I think? If I dont write in my diary, I feel really uncomfortable. Even if its one thing, I feel that I need to leave proof of my existence each day so that I can sleep peacefully. While writing my diary, I think without my knowing, I get rid of some of that stress too. I write about all sorts of stuff. I write about my dreams, I swear, and even doodle meaninglessly.

**Do you remember what you wrote about yesterday?**

Yesterday? I remember the one the day before yesterday, hold on. What did I write about? Um Hold on.

**Due to the Zeze controversy, theres been a lot of talk right? How do you feel seeing the many awful things they say and sometimes the deep and lengthy things they write?**

Lots of thoughts came to mind. I saw a lot and thought a lot as well. Theres always been criticism and swear words that are unrelated to the issue, so Ill leave that part aside, but I saw some posts that were amazingly logical. Within that, there were both criticisms and replies in defence. Seeing the discussions arising from this song, the many opinions about it and the topic of the discussion gradually widening in scope, honestly, I felt grateful. Amidst the noise judging me as a person, to the people who were calmly focusing on the issue at hand and politely voicing their thoughts about it, whether they were criticisms or replies in defence, no matter what, Im thankful for that. Thankful and startled and thought it was really cool. Being at the centre of it all, I was starting to feel a bit awkward/embarrassed. When interpreting a song, you dont want to come to a conclusion that that is correct and this is wrong. To me, my freedom is important, so to maintain that, I think I should allow others to have their freedom to interpret. Just like before I released the album, I still like this song. If someone doesnt like me as a person just because of the lyrics in Zeze, Ill wholly accept that. Since that persons interpretation and that persons feelings clearly exist. But its not good to draw conclusions about me being paedophilic. I think theres a need to separate ones interpretation of a song and their criticism towards a person.

**Arent you just like Zeze (in the story)? Based on what you said just now, as youre shrewd and clever, youre loved and hated, as youre insensitive and act before you think, youre loved and hated; the talk about 23-year-old IU seems to go back and forth.**
 
Some people feel that way, but some people feel, I dont know as well. No one has the right to tell someone else that their way of thinking is wrong, since you cant force anyone to interpret things in just one way. I cant impose or block my thoughts from others either. Thats what I think.

**When did we argue over the lyrics? We have fun dissecting the lyrics, whats supposed to mean what.**

I didnt expect myself to touch on this topic during todays interview. Thats something I keep struggling with. I keep talking to people too. Those whom I feel have always been right in their judgement, saying things like, Heres what I think, but if Im wrong, please tell me so.

**What kind of advice do they give you then?**

Like what I said, there are some people who would tell me what they think, while some would feel that anyway Im dealing with dangerous stuff. I keep thinking this way. If I do get the chance to talk about this, Ill entrust it to the freedom for interpretation. Since the freedom for interpretation is important to the person and to me as well.

**No matter what you say, youll have antis. Since therell always be misunderstandings.**

Leaving behind the talk about liking me, disliking me, liking the song, disliking the song, this is the right way to think, thats the wrong way to think, there have been people who were hurt by the topic itself this time. To those people, rather than explaining my intentions and the parts they misunderstood, I would just like to apologise.

**Its tiring right?**

Strength is something like this to me. When you want it, you dont have it and when you dont want it, you have it again. We just need to live on no matter what. So I dont worry too much about lacking strength. When I have strength, anyway the state of being strong is more tiring. But when you lack strength, theres nothing youre able to do. Some people say it cant be helped if you lack the strength, but if you have a lot of strength and its not the kind of strength you want, youll be in even more agony. 

**If someone were to give you a gift of 5 days?**

No matter how I spend it, 5 days wont mean much.

**Then how would you spend it?**

I want to fall into a deep sleep.

**Throughout the 5 days?**
 
A really deep sleep. When I wake up, Ill go, Uwah, my mind is clear and I feel so energetic like Im reborn! I think it would be great to go into a deep sleep for 5 days.

**Ill ask you again then, how was 2015 for you?**

Good times when I reflect back. They really were.

As of 29/10/16 i'm officialy a mod of /r/aiyu.
being on this subreddit regularly it felt really outdated and not as active as it potentially can be.

So i decide to request for mod and make this sub active again! I already changed the subreddit look and i hope you will like it as it is something completely different from what it was..
Also any feedback will be appreciated!

So now going to the real thing...

To make this sub active again i need so suggestions what you all want. now its all over the place and random. Personally i was thinking about making theme weeks ( fancam week, Picture week, cover week etc....) maybe even do it per day so each day will be posted with something? Please do comment bellow for any suggestions ideas anyhing is welcome. On another note i can do some daily/weekly post if you guys want.

Also be free to post anything IU updates on so twitter instagram or just a small news item just to get things going.

Hello everyone, I recently suggested to start theme weeks so we can bring this sub more life!

-----

**What exactly does this mean?** 

In short, 

every week we will have a different theme to post. Every subscriber to this sub can submit their theme related content. After 14 days we will check the most upvoted post from that week and that user gets 1 point on the leaderboard. Altough you can't really win something i'm sure that it will be fun and useful for the subreddit and maybe even for your IU collection!

**Theme week starts every 2 weeks on Sunday**

I will make a new post after the 7 days with the anouncement of the new theme , also it will then provide the winner of the week and the leaderboard standings.

*Note: all other content may still be posted and is approved, only the post that will meet the requirements will be be used for the theme week*

-------------------------
list for now:

**Picture week** (favourite IU picture) ~~[7/11/16 to 14/11/16]~~

**Video week** (favourite IU video: varietyshow cuts, dramacuts, practice video etc..)

**Gif week** (favourite  IU Gif)

**Performance week** (favourite performance video | no fancam  )

**cover week** ( favourite Cover done by IU or her songs covered)

**Fancam week** (favourite fancam)

**MV week** (favourite Music Video)

**side track week** (favourite non title track song)

this can can be anything from old songs, covers, remix, acoustic, or dance.
However no fancams as we have a special theme week for that.

I have been looking all around for a physical copy of [IU - Modern Times Epilogue](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA2WDg1OA==/z/nNAAAOxy63FSwgR~/$_35.JPG). I've looked around quite a few online kpop websites, and have not found it available anywhere. The only place I've found it is on Ebay and there the prices seem unreasonable (upwards of $250). Is there any place that I can find it online? Thanks!",0,4

We've had a few discussion posts, and there's more to follow. For now, I was thinking it would be great to have a little friendly competition. That means - ART CONTEST!

Now, before you write yourself off, ""Man I'm a horrible artist"" I use the term ""art"" quite liberally. What do you think is art? Could be a piano cover, a vocal cover, a meme, even! And of course traditional drawings or digital paintings of IU are also welcome. And yes, really, anything IU related is acceptable. So get your MS paint ready, start cutting out pictures of IU in photoshop, or pull out your dusty old art tablet.

The DEADLINE, and when the voting thread will be posted, is IN ONE MONTH.
The date will be February 23rd, 2/23/18.
I'll give it to you straight, the only prize you get for winning is my eternal admiration and that of the subreddit. I'd do a banner contest or something so we could admire everyone's work, but idk who the mods are and I'm too lazy to find out!

Myself, and the good folk of discord (Join here: https://discord.gg/zy3ycug) will be competing as well!

Above all, have fun and be open. Remember, anything from your worst memes, to poems, short stories, art, music covers, anything!

tl;dr 
Art competition, anything IU related is viable. Deadline is 2/23/18
Good luck!",0,6

Which album should I start with?,thatwaszen,1522603428,"IU has slowly crept into my world, first as a friend of In-na (bias) and then Hyori's B&amp;B and then Nayeon's (other bias) crush. Funny, I hadn't heard her sing much at all until very recently, just her playing guitar and singing on IG. Now I finally understand what the buzz is about. So I don't know which album to begin with? Pallette, her album of the year? Or should I start further back? Thanks for the help! 

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful comments. They all really helped to to give me a handle on a party that I seem to be very late to. Haha! I settled on Palette and Spring of Twenty Years to start. Funny, the first song I auditioned from Palette was Black Out, which, after about 30 seconds got me to buy the album. And this [live performance](https://youtu.be/lDwz2QpPaKQ) helped seal the deal. (I must have listened to that song a dozen times already, its so addictive.) Anyway, thanks again.

You just can't beat long hair for me. I think I was truly won over when I watched
Scarlet Heart because I'm a sucker for historic hairstyles and in my opinion
long hair and short hair are different kinds of beauty and I just love IU with
long to medium length hair.

Personally, I think she is moving in a more mature sounding direction lately, with heart aching pieces like Love Alone and By the Stream. With Palette I feel she has settled into a style that fits her, and has committed to possible change in the future. I do hope she releases more songs similar to Through the Night, mixed in with her adorable personality with songs like Not Love, Spring, or Cherry Blossoms.

I began to wonder what is the IU that I would choose if she can only sing either fast paced or slow paced. What if somehow we lived in a parallel world where only one side of IU's music exist. What would be your decision? You have to choose one side and give your reason as to your decision. This is a tough one. I will start by saying I choose the emotional/slow paced type music because the first IU song I ever heard or made a huge impact on me was ""Heart"". While I love her fast paced tracks, but the slow paced songs usually stuck with me the longest and I remember how there was a period of time where I replay knee, raindrop and dear name for weeks and months. Her voice also have that tinge of fragility that makes it very suitable for emiting emotion through music.",11,6

Her acting in that drama was her best acting yet IMO. The tone, the seriousness is something new I've seen from her. 

I can't wait for 'Persona'. It looks like a similar atmosphere to My Mister with a serious tone.


Her growth as an artist shows how mature she has become since her debut. I hope to more like this!

So I was a *huge* IU fan way back (like pre-""Good Day"" era) I collected a ton of her posters and albums etc. Fast forward to today, and while I'm still a fan, I simply don't have room for all this stuff anymore! I'll be moving soon so I'd love to sell this stuff all in one go.   


The *stuff*:   
\-7 Physical Albums (Last Fantasy and earlier)  
\-IU Posters (I think I have like at least 6. Some are hiding around here somewhere)  
\-IU Postcards   
\-IU Calendars (2016 and 2017 I believe, but still worth it for the pictures!)  
\-IU mini socks with her picture on them (yeah this was a thing)  
\-Any other IU stuff thats hiding around here that I can dredge up will be included  


**All stuff in very good or near perfect condition.**  


Anyone interested, please shoot me a message. I'm willing to let this all go for a fair price. Pics will be provided on request. I just wanted to put feelers out there to see if anyone was actually interested. Chicago area only please!  


I hope it was okay to make this kind of post in this sub... Not sure there are any other IU fan subreddits out there.",12,19

Side note: I had a weird experience with my last membership. I signed up for the membership last year and I paid for something and I was under the impression that I was going to receive something in the mail. Fast forward a few months, I started to think, ""huh, maybe I just paid to be a member..?"" A few more months go by and I receive a random phone call confirming my identity? I go to a random person's house (hind-sight kindof sketchy) and it turns out they somehow ended up with my membership package! 

tl;dr: many months after I signed up last year, got my membership package from a random stranger.",0,5

So, I will be in Korea next month at the same time that IU will be having her Love, Poem concert in Busan. I know that IU tickets sell out hella fast but I really wanna go so I just have some questions on getting them.  

1. What is the optimal way of getting tickets as fast as possible? They're being sold on Melon and since I'm in California I'll be using the global site. Does anyone have experience with Melon Global? 

2. Will most of the tickets sell out to people in the fan club tonight? Is there still a chance for someone that's not in it to get good seats.

3. If I can't get a ticket on release how often will the canceled tickets pop up on the website? Will more people cancel the closer it gets to the concert date? And what is the time that Melon releases the canceled tickets so I could scoop one up? 

Sorry for so many questions, but any answers/tips on getting tickets is really appreciated. Thanks!",1,10

I recently came to Korea about 2 months ago to study abroad and I'll be here until next summer. So I guess what I'm wondering is if I basically missed my chance at seeing IU live? I know her tickets are already hard to get, but still sucks that I didn't get to try!

Part 2 Above the time, The Guy looks for the Girl

THERE MUST BE A PART 3, A HAPPY ENDING!!!  Let's wait another 8 years.

&amp;#x200B;

\------

Time is nonlinear, depends on how you perceives time.

&amp;#x200B;

The ending in You &amp; I is what a future she saw where both of them are together. But we don't know when did that happen, when did they got together?

&amp;#x200B;

So IU travelled to the future in hopes of seeing the guy, the date is shown in You&amp;I is 191231, which we think is 31st Dec 2019. And he woke up right after that. (TIME TRAVEL SIDE EFFECT?). 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the characters themselves are not normal human, based on the place they lived in(another dimension?), maybe they were people who got stuck in between reality due to time travelling(whose are those other people in the photos anyway). And IU confirmed that her character have unique ability to peek into time in her recent VLIVE, where she saw the future of them being together and also she saw how the guy built a time travel machine.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the mind blowing part. Maybe the future that she saw, is his past. (""Your Name"" anybody?)

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my theory for part 3 of the story. The guy is from the future, where he had lost her(the one he loved). He tried to travel back in time(2019 -&gt; 2011) to find her and then he experience a time travel side effect and fell into eternal slumber. Then when she time travelled the effect was somehow reversed and due to time/space/dimension distortion the history itself has changed(photos on the wall changed! different kid in the photos).

&amp;#x200B;

He travelled back in time and she travelled forward. And he somehow lost his memories of her due to his previous time travel. And maybe her time travel failed and she is now trapped in a time/space dimension(tesseract, refer to ""Interstellar""), where she is aware of him but he is not. Then through some event, she found out she could manipulate his reality.(Interstellar reference again, they are now in different time &amp; space)

&amp;#x200B;

8 years later on 31st Dec 2019, where their time now converges(Time moves differently in different dimension, 5 minutes in her dimension might means 8 years in his.) he realises what's happening and his memories is coming back. This means time/space itself is experiencing another disruption, maybe a miracle? He finishes the final touch on his time machine(at this point maybe the time machine itself is not perfect, that's why it failed on IU?),  turned the hand on the time machine and they met finally in between time/space/dimension &amp; reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

How did I interpreted the dancing scene. They both arrived at a place, he takes a look at his wrist(the watch she drew, a promised date) then she pushed him. As if asking why did you came here so late. Then when he tried to hug her and she dodges. (You know when girls are angry LOL) But finally he manages to make up to her and they danced happily till the end. Maybe the miracle is ending(did you realise the mess/flower petals fall on the floor?), when the time travel effect starts to kicks in again and they slowly falling asleep (this would then match with the previous theory of why he is in slumber in YOU &amp; I mv). Before the dimension slowly crumbles away, she drew a blue rose on his hand (Your Name ?????????). Blue rose = Miracle.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he got sent back to his reality(He is now on a roof of a random place, doesn't look like the previous house he stayed in.) And he thought it's all a sad dream, until he opened his hand and saw the blue rose. And the last scene where she disappears signifying she got out of the tesseract. 

&amp;#x200B;

And did you guys saw IU's goose on the roof with him? maybe the goose manage to travelled to his time but IU didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's where it's connected to the last scene of You&amp;I mv. Where they forgets about the time travelling(Like in Your Name where they forgets about each other like it was a dream). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then after some time, he met her in the store. And they kinda had this feeling of familiarity but doesn't remembers it clearly. That's why they didn't have any close interaction until he turns back before walking out of the store.

&amp;#x200B;

THEN THEY SAYS :

""KIMI NO NAME WA?""

&amp;#x200B;

HAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHA.

&amp;#x200B;
