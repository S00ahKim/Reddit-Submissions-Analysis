I signed up for the non-homework version but it was my understanding that except for the homework, the course was the same for both.  If that's not the case and the homework version is more rigorous than ignore this post.

It seems like a high school course.  What can you say when you derive the BP update rules and the chain rule is nowhere to be found nor the derivation of a sigmoid gradient etc.  No discussion of Max Lik. or MAP.  If they spent 5 minutes with a hand-wavy explanation of a partial derivative you wouldn't even need calculus as a prereq for it; just basic algebra.

Me: 3 startups under my belt. Started as a programmer, then trainer, then entrepreneur, now CTO &amp; Board member for a leading customer insight company part of large bank. Large system and infrastructure specialist. Extensive &amp; practical experience in raising funds and successfully managing both startup and established businesses. Fascinated by the power of data. Can't imagine myself spending the rest of my life being a cog in the machine.

You: Machine learning specialist, programmer, analyst, understands how to navigate and crunch large datasets, from BI to predictive analytics. Interested in implementing applications from fraud detection to margin improvements through better clustering regardless of industry. Fascinated by the power of data. Can't imagine himself spending the rest of his or her life being a cog in the machine.


The startup:

The core idea it to build platforms and systems around the progressively larger datasets held by various sized companies, helping them solve big issues - cost reduction, profitability and reducing risk. Im an infrastructure and software specialist and have access to 1) systems, 2) datasets 3) extensive practical in certain industry segments, namely web-scale companies and tier 1 retailers.

This project is in the very early planning stages. I'm looking forward to discuss the form it could take with like-minded individuals but with complementary skills sets, namely: predictive analytics &amp; AI as it applies to machine learning on large datasets. 

Want more specifics ideas? I have plenty of these, but Im sure you do to, so lets meet face to face and discuss them.

Ultimately the goal is to crystallize on a specific concept, develop together a minimum viable product and get the company bootstrapped or angel-funded (something I also have plenty of experience with), all via a lean startup model.


My philosophy on startups:

Startups built in ones free time often fail because they drag on, ending up as little more than side projects you cant quite get rid of (due to co-founder guilt, or perhaps the little money they bring in every month). 

The core idea for this project is based on lean, that is, to launch a minimum viable product as early as possible. Getting feedback. Measuring results (important!). Pivot if its not working. This helps tremendously in staying motivated, limits the dreaded paralyzing fear of failure, and more importantly, keep the time from inception to first client/funding to a minimum.

If it sounds interesting please message me and we can exchange contact details! Worst that can happen is we have a great chat!",4,18

How well does gradient descent work on this kind of problem where you're essentially trying to pick out comparatively subtle relationships between the input and output data amidst a *lot* of noise?

Would a data mining approach be more effective here?

Can anyone provide a more intuitive explanation, particularly as it might relate to correcting training data for a machine learning algorithm?

Specifically, can Heckman correction be applied when a supervised learning algorithm is responsible for choosing the samples which are used to train future versions of that supervised learning algorithm?

As a concrete example: We must choose between 100 ads to show people when they visit our website, and our goal is to maximize the number of people who click on the ads.

We can train a logistic model to predict the probability that a user will click on any given ad, and then run this model on all 100 ads for each visitor to our site, showing them the ad that has the highest probability of a click.

But now when we collect the results of these ad recommendations we have a biased sample, the bias being determined by a previous iteration of our supervised learning algorithm.

With a cursory introduction to genetic algorithms, I thought that it would be interesting to use them to generate these strings that generate music.  Creating a generator of these strings randomly is pretty trivial, I think:

(where iter is the iteration variable, i)

* s -&gt; (val operator val) 
* val -&gt; s | iter | const
* const -&gt; 0-4096
* operator -&gt; / | * | ^ | &gt;&gt; etc.

From what I understand about GA's, and correct me if I'm wrong, but we need to encode this string into a string of bits, which is where I ran into my first problem. Since this is a kind of grammar, you can't just change around any of these bits willy nilly, because then it might not be a valid sentence. So, rather than encode the string as single bits, I thought I could encode the string as integers which are then treated as bits in a traditional GA. Depending on the value of the integer, I could determine if it was a value or an operator and swap or replace accordingly. I think this would work, but I'm not familiar enough with GA's to know if this is a method that has been done before.

The second problem I have, and don't have a solution for, is what fitness function to use. I'm completely at a loss. I was thinking of checking the cycles that are generated, maybe for length or complexity? But I'm not sure, and that's where I'd like your advice. I'm not sure if I wan't a fitness function for a 'traditional' music generating GA, because it's not traditional music, but I don't know what is out there, so I'm up for suggestions.

I'm a total newbie to ML, I'm taking Stanford's ml-class right now. Since this is more of a general question, I thought it would be better to post it here rather than there.

So here's my problem: I'm trying to figure out some application for the techniques that I'm studying (trying to find some nails to use this new hammer on...), and so far I've had two ideas that I could use. They're both related to signal (sound) processing, something that I also have NO experience with, which makes them that much harder. I'm not saying I could implement them right away, but I would like to know if ML techniques are the way to think about this problems or not. Here they are:

1) A ""Wilhelm Scream Finder"". It seems to me that, given some sample extracts from movies with the ""[Wilhelm Scream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream)	"" on them (say, from [this movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio), I could get some training examples and train a Neural Network or an SVM to classify whether some other extract of some other movie has the scream in it or not. That seems doable, but what about the REAL problem, of having a whole movie sound track and actually FINDING Wilhelm Screams in it? That seems like a whole other problem in itself, which I have no idea how to even start solving.

2) Similar to the ""cocktail party problem"": I have several (well, three or four) separate tracks of a song. On each of them, one of the instruments (guitar, bass, drums) is higher than all the others, but all of them have have been recorded using the same ""background"", which is a low-volume base track with all the others playing together. I would like to ""remove"" this background noise, which is very similar in all of them. Again, no idea of how to solve this.

Are these even good problems for ML to solve, or should I just look for other solutions (or other problems!)?

I am looking to build a demand forecasting model that factors in weather. That's a straightforward task. 

But the mystery for me is how to account for weather *forecasts*. I want to predict demand a week or so advance, so we can staff up or down as needed.

Since weather forecasts are nor perfectly correlated to weather,  I need to handle the difference somehow. My ideas are:

* Build a model that measures forecast accuracy, and use that to put error bars on my demand predictions.
* Train models on actual historical weather, but test/validate/combine models on a dataset on recent weather forecasts that I collect myself.
* Find a dataset of historical weather *forecasts*, and train my model on that data.
* Assume forecasts are perfect, and don't spend time or effort worrying about forecast error.
* Don't try to predict business on a daily grain; use a weekly grain where actual (average) weather and forecasts are more closely matched

**TL;DR: when building a predictive model of a weather-correlated effect, do I care that weather forecasts are imperfect?**",12,6

In other words: 
If you are classifying digits, the output is a 10 dimensional vector where we expect a 1 in only one dimension. I am asking if neural networks could be reliably used in cases where we expect the output to contain ones in multiple dimensions.

I understand that you all are looking for ways to apply your new skills, and you absolutely should. If you don't practice your new knowledge, you're likely to forget it. Unfortunately though, walking around with a hammer in search of a nail is generally a bad way to go about it.

I'm sorry I don't have any resources to offer.

Maybe find a problem that has already been solved by a technique you want to practice and try figuring out how to do it yourself.

Your field has been a big inspiration to me (and to many cognitive neuroscientists), but I find your papers incredibly difficult to decipher.  

Policy abstraction seems to be implemented in a nice set of dissociable neuroanatomical structures, but there are some large portions of cortex that do not perfectly fit this framework, and there are some indications that these areas may be dissociable both functionally and structurally. One possibility is that these areas are performing something like state abstraction. 

The problem: I don't know exactly what that means (beyond ""aggregating action-relevant features of the environment and discarding action-irrelevant features to yield a more compact state space""), nor whether there are currently thought to be dissociable subproblems/subcomponents of this larger problem, nor how they are  thought to interact with policy abstraction (or the classes of available actions), nor situations under which we could make state abstraction more difficult, complex, or higher-order without affecting policy abstraction (a necessity if we're going to attempt to use functional neuroimaging). Is there even really a hierarchy to states, in the same way there can be a hierarchy to policy?
