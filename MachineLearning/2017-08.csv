Ideas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6qtzmd/project_open_source_autosemiauto_audio/,dannyhw,1501562380,"So my experience with machine learning has been limited to a few courses that were basically case studies on implementation. I do have a strong background in software engineering and strong enough background in audio engineering to get this project going as long as I have guidance on what approach to ML I should take.

I have a data structure designed, and I've already looked into the feasibility of extracting all this data from audio files. It's actually fairly simple. Basically, a song is broken up into measures, and each of those is broken up into frequency bands that are essentially 1 measure long wavs. For each of those, I measure overall loudness using a standard algorithm, and stereo width based on an algorithm that I've already worked out.

A measure made up of bands, their loudness and widths make up the general sound of a mix as it encapsulates the parameters that go into the mixing and mastering process.

Now, the plan is to populate a database with mountains and mountains of records extracted from professionally mixed and mastered major label releases across a wide range of genres. Using this, we should be able to create something that when provided a sound profile on any rough audio mix will build a target profile based on the dynamics found in similar sounding professional recordings. Then a standard loudness normalization algorithm can be fed target values from this target profile. A similar algorithm will be adapted to adjust the stereo width.

In mastering audio this is called multiband dynamics, using a technique called compression, and it's done manually and takes a lot of skill, parameter tweaking that depends on other factors and time. Instead of compression we can achieve the same effect using normalization because we don't have to be linear.

There is a company that offers this as a proprietary service, but they offer a one size fits all process that provides ""good enough"" processing to pass off as mastering, but my intention is to also provide a GUI that will let the user use actual audio engineering skill to easily adjust the values, but in manageable numerical values in chunks of one measure at a time as opposed to drawing linear automation to manipulate an audio signal.

Any help, insight, suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If you have ideas on theory I can handle implementation no problem, and I think the data I'm working with should be very manageable. 

My only documentation so far is a commentated javascript object prototype representing an audio file built as I researched how this could all be done earlier: https://github.com/dabbamont/brainy-mastering/blob/master/design-docs/object-prototypes.js",3,4

17,2017-8-1,2017,8,1,19,6qvbu8,[D] Where does this hyped news come from? *Facebook shut down AI that invented its own language.*,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6qvbu8/d_where_does_this_hyped_news_come_from_facebook/,nomaderx,1501583012,"My Facebook wall is full of people sharing this story that Facebook *had* to shut down an AI system it developed that invented it's own language. Here are some of these articles:

[Independent: Facebook's AI robots shut down after they start talking to each other in their own language](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-artificial-intelligence-ai-chatbot-new-language-research-openai-google-a7869706.html)

[BGR: Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language](http://bgr.com/2017/07/31/facebook-ai-shutdown-language/)

[Digital Journal: Researchers shut down AI that invented its own language](http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/a-step-closer-to-skynet-ai-invents-a-language-humans-can-t-read/article/498142)

EDIT#3: [FastCoDesign: AI Is Inventing Languages Humans Cant Understand. Should We Stop It?](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90132632/ai-is-inventing-its-own-perfect-languages-should-we-let-it) [Likely the first article]

Note that this is related to the work in the *Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning for Negotiation Dialogues* paper. On it's own, it is interesting work.

While the article from Independent seems to be the only one that finally gives the clarification *'The company chose to shut down the chats because ""our interest was having bots who could talk to people""'*, **ALL** the articles say things that suggest that researchers went into panic mode, had to 'pull the plug' out of fear, this stuff is scary. One of the articles (don't remember which) even went on to say something like *'A week after Elon Musk suggested AI needs to be regulated and Mark Zuckerberg disagreed, Facebook had to shut down it's AI because it became too dangerous/scary'* (or something to this effect).

While I understand the hype around deep learning (a.k.a backpropaganda), etc., I think these articles are so ridiculous. I wouldn't even call this hype, but almost 'fake news'. I understand that sometimes articles should try to make the news more interesting/appealing by hyping it a bit, but this is almost detrimental, and is just promoting AI fear-mongering. 

EDIT#1: Some people on Facebook are actually believing this fear to be real, sending me links and asking me about it. :/

EDIT#2: As pointed out in the comments, there's also this opposite article:

While they may be math & theory heavy (Wasserstein-GAN comes to mind), i don't see progress or even anything regarding more fundamental research on NNs. Is there really a stalemate or are the papers just not ""hyped"" up enough?
While not a complete beginner, i am relatively new to NNs and have only really focused on GANs yet.

Areas that come to my mind (are probably bogus, just to explain what i mean):

* convergence of SGD-like methods in non-convex environments (with maybe respect to the training data?). Not in terms of experimental success, but theoretical properties.
* Other Training-Algorithms, for example algorithms that are good at finding Nash-Equilibria
* any theoretical bounds 
  * generalisation of NNs
  * convergence to acceptable minima
  * loss
* making sense of the weights of trained NNs
* ??

I can't imagine that nobody is working on these topics. Which groups are the most productive? What are ""hot"" topics in these areas?

From the paper, to do layer normalization, one needs to know the number of output neurons for that layer, then do normalization on inputs to each output neuron. After searching for a while, I found this code (https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training/blob/4fde7f36d697576d06ee0046630064076c196ed6/tflib/ops/layernorm.py) and this article about img2col (https://petewarden.com/2015/04/20/why-gemm-is-at-the-heart-of-deep-learning/, section **How GEMM works for Convolutions**) which helped me to implement layer norm for 2D convolution successfully. From the article, the number of output neurons in 2D convolution is the depth channels. Extend this to 3D case: the output channels for 3D convolution are the temporal channels. However, my model did worse after putting this 3D layer norm in. I guess the cause is the img2col function in the 3D case is different. Maybe the output channels are both depth and temporal channels and my understanding of layer norm for the 2D case is flawed. Anyone has any tips they can share on this layer normalization or the img2col function for 3D convolution? Thanks.",0,3

However, when I execute my TF graph, I'm getting 0% Loss and 100% Accuracy from the very start.

Ive based a lot of an [initial build](https://github.com/aadharna/Destiny/blob/master/TFTake1.ipynb) off of the [CIFAR-10 project I did](https://github.com/aadharna/CIFAR-10_ConvNet/blob/master/image_classification.ipynb), but adapted to my scenario of an MLP rather than a conv-net. 

To make sure that the problem wasn't with my data (such as I included a feature which closely resembles the target) I spent yesterday testing around with different vertical slices of my data set. No matter what variables I input into the network, the result was always the same -- 0% Loss, 100% Accuracy. 

Furthermore, I spun up an simple SVM using sklearn with both the [rapid iteration data set](https://github.com/aadharna/Destiny/blob/master/testing_dataframe_205.csv) (first 1000 lines of the full dataset) and the full data set and ended up with 91% accuracy and 92% accuracy respectively.

This tells me that my problem is not with my data set but instead with TF and my neural network. To further confirm this, [I put together a NN using Keras](https://github.com/aadharna/Destiny/blob/master/KerasNN.ipynb) and got good results (94.8% Accuracy; 12.1% Loss).

Details about the data set: 

I have a 17 individualized statistics for each person who participated in the match, and I've flattened my vectors to be match-specific. Meaning one line of my CSV file is one match with form =: 

> <person0TeamAstats, person1TeamAstats, ..., person5TeamAstats, person0TeamBstats, ..., person5TeamBstats, targetVariable>


Each row of my CSV has 205 statistics. Which, once the target Class is removed shrinks to 204 making each line a 1x204 vector. 


Therefore, I was hoping someone could take a look at my Tensorflow code and point me in the right direction.

Best,

5: 'AI for presidents' classes made compulsory for Comm/Journo majors

IMHO, even if there are 150 decent quality graduates entering the job market every year, the mainstream media landscape will look very different.

**Using Current Techniques for Generation are Limiting**

For a long time, language generation has been stuck with the max-likelihood objective function. Recently there have been some attempts to use reinforcement learning and wasserstein gans to improve language generation and they have to some extent. 

In the past, rl used a discriminator's *probability* output to estimate the reward signal used. However, probability can only yield a meaningful reward after many samplings. Doing multiple samplings is very expensive, especially when it is for only achieving *one* reward.

**Using Wasserstein Distance as a Reward**

Ideally, we don't want the *probability* of how correct a sequence is. This is often sharply zero or one (because of the sigmoid activation). Rather, we want a scalar telling us *how correct* a sequence is. If we train a critic on the the wasserstein objective, then we can generate a sequence, feed it through the critic, and estimate the wasserstein distance. This directly tells us *how correct* the sequence is.

Of course, some phrases in a sequence may be good and some may be bad. So instead, we should train our critic on parts of sequences such as REGS [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06547.pdf). This will tell us the wasserstein distance for *every* word. We then can use these rewards to train the generator via REINFORCE.

It is important to note that the wasserstein distance represents the geometric distance between two distributions. So, when we *just* feed the generator sequence (and not a real sequence) in the forward pass in the critic, we can just see what its specific wasserstein *value* is. We use this specific value as a reward. 

**Summary**

The benefits of this approach is that we do not have to sample multiple times to generate one reward value. Every sample generates a scalar reward that we can use to update the generator. 


1. Pretrain Generator on Max Likelihood
2. Pretrain Critic on WGAN objective

Then conduct the following loop:

    for step in range(steps):
      Generator generates sequence `s`
      Critic evaluates wasserstein value of every word in s, which is denoted `wv`
      Generator is updated via reinforce using wv as reward
      Critic is updated by normal wgan training regime.

My images are high frequency with subtle features; every bit of detail counts.

This was especially apparent to me during my hobbyist game development (RMXP & RMVX) days as a teenager.

I love machine learning and especially deep learning but feel burdened by the fact that the community (as beautifully diverse as it is) is unpractically dispersed across various platforms (Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Github, et c). There's many smaller communities but they seem either fairly inactive, under developed, too small, and/or too nich, on top of often being very visually unappealing and/or unintuitive to navigate.

Personally, I believe the related subreddits (including this one) are the best we got so far for having discussions and sharing ideas but so much can be improved but it's impossible simply due to how Reddit works as a platform.

Thus I am wondering if there's any demand for a community website dedicated to all things Machine Learning in one place. Not meant to compete against the existing communities and platforms, but rather to complement and hopefully establish some connection across platforms.

More specifically, something similar to [All About Circuits](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/) with a modern and organized forum (with optional profiles for users to inform about their specialty, education, location, etc), journalism aimed towards those familiar with Machine Learning, learning material (on-site and references to off-site material), organized list of papers, and more. A website for the community and run by the community; connecting the community together across other platforms.

EDIT: Wow, this question seems popular. To clarify a bit, I do assume that that the reader has a decent math background, linear algebra, probability, calculus, at the basic level. Also, I know that most papers can be understood just by reading the English and ignoring the math, or just looking at the non-math sections which describe the algorithm. That works well, however, I'm interested in the math. I want to be able to understand and appreciate the math which sometimes is very relevant to the idea. This would correspond to understanding Borel hierarchies and Lebesgue measures. I can handle the case when the author is just being a showoff. But what if the math really is crucial?",69,347

I'm working with a highly imbalanced data set where the minority class accounts for 1.5%< of the total set. This leads to poor predictive performance by most models when nothing is done to address the problem because most algorithms will minimize cost on the majority class, to the detriment of the minority class, when training so as to decrease overall cost. 

So far I've tried out ANNs,RFs,XGBs, and SVMs and have found that XGB and RF outperform the others in this particular problem, so the remaining post will be about RF and XGB.

I've tried penalizing classification on the minority class much more than the majority class to try to fix the imbalance on an algorithmic level but I've found undersampling and then training on the resulting data set to be more effective in my case. I've also found the oversampling the minority and hybrid methods like SMOTE perform worse than undersampling.

I was able to modify sklearns random forest classifier to undersample the data set at the tree level to minimize information loss and found it really helped. Before that, I was just undersampling the dataset and sending it through the algorithm so that n-trees trained on just 1 subsample of the dataset (with the modification, n-trees now train on n subsets of the dataset). 

I really want to do the same tweak on the XGBoost package but cannot seem to find where the heck XGBoost generates subsamples before training individual trees. 

Does anybody know if this idea is doable? I found some more of less recent posts asking similar questions and finding that the typical response was ""train a bunch of different XGBoosts and average their predictions."" This answer is a little unsatisfying because it seems inefficient. ",7,12

Feel free to browse the [41 accepted papers](https://sites.google.com/view/implicitmodels/accepted-papers) and the [schedule](https://sites.google.com/view/implicitmodels/schedule).

The workshop features a one-hour panel discussion broadly on the advances, applications, and future prospects of implicit models. The panel consists of:

+ [Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/) (Princeton)
+ [Stefano Ermon](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) (Stanford)
+ [Qiang Liu](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~qliu/index.html) (Dartmouth)
+ [Kerrie Mengerson](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mengerse/) (Queensland University of Technology)
+ [Dougal Sutherland](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dougals/) (UCL)

This post is a call for your participation! Some examples of questions are:

+ Where do you see the scope of adversarial training methods for advancing approximate Bayesian computation?

+ From the density ratio estimation perspective, adversarial training methods forego requiring tractable densities at the cost of incurring more unstable training than maximum likelihood. However, oftentimes we do have access to the density. How might we might exploit such information without resorting to the maximum likelihood objective?
+ What standards should we follow in evaluating implicit models, whether it be research or application?
+ Recent results have shown that GAN training has various desirable stability properties in theory (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04156, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) yet in practice they seem to collapse to a small number of modes that then move indefinitely rather than converging. How can the recent theoretical results be reconciled with the performance in practice?


We will collect any questions, comments, and discussion until August 9 at 22:00 (Sydney time), and share them with our invited speakers during the panel. We hope to see many of you at Sydney next week.

What is the state of the research, do you guys know some papers that talk about the subject ? (Rules on architectures definition, and param' optimization.)

What is your opinion about the subject and where it's headed ?  (will a machine be able in like 10 years to define a good architecture to handle a ML/DL task?)

What are the main applications of ML/DL first concerned (prediction with simple numerical inputs, for example?), what are the applications that are less concerned (NLP tasks, for example?).

Users will raise a support request thru our existing ticketing system. Now my ML should read the description and understand the below key points,

* Severity
* Sentiment (+ve or -ve)
* If any key information like user id, email, etc (already configured) are missing

If it is possible, what type of model I have to choose and what would be the high level NN architecture required for this?

Thanks.

[Discussion],https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6sdjsd/caffe_training_a_custom_and_specific_model/,purplepharaoh,1502199722,"I'm always looking for new projects to develop and new technologies to play around with.  Apple's CoreML and Vision for AR/machine learning sound really fun and exciting, so I started kicking around ideas for apps I could write to play with these new frameworks.  I came across [this link](http://reza.codes/2017-07-29/how-to-train-your-own-dataset-for-coreml/) on training CoreML data models using Caffe and thought that would be a good starting point.


The app idea I came up with was one that would scan ""items"" and maintain an inventory of what you own.  The items, though, wouldn't be generic ones like ""lamp"", ""sofa"", ""car"", etc.  Instead, they would be items with specific appearance, like the cover of a book or a baseball card.  I was able to obtain a data set consisting of **clean** images for a large number of baseball cards.  The images are high quality, and all cropped and scaled the same way.  My question is, how do I go about training Caffe to recognize *image X* as (for example) *Cal Ripken, 1988*?


All of the Caffe examples I've seen are focused on training the model to recognize generic objects.  *Here are 1000 pictures of different types of dogs*  In my case, though, I have a very specific data model.  I don't want to recognize *baseball card*.  I want to recognize a *specific* baseball card, and be able to differentiate between them.


Can anyone give me some tips, pointers, links, etc. on how to get started with this?  I'm a Java, Objective-C, and Swift developer by trade if that helps.  I'd love to hear any recommendations you can give me!",3,2

To cut a long story short, we're putting together our review of AMD's new Vega video cards, and we'd like to include a machine learning benchmark among our test suite.

The reason I bring this up is because, unfortunately, the driver situation for review hardware ties our hands a bit. Linux drivers for new hardware is almost never available day 1, let alone in advance to reviewers. What we tend to be given are *just* the Windows drivers for a new piece of hardware. As a result, as much as I'd love to run something like DeepBench, that's not a viable option for us. So we have to stick with what works on Windows.

Which brings me to this post. For obvious reasons Linux is the platform of choice for machine learning, both in research and production, so I realize the inherent folly of this question. That said: are there any halfway-decent ML benchmarks that work under Windows?

So far my research hasn't turned up anything. However the field is so vast that I could easily miss something. Truthfully, I'm not in a position where I can be especially picky here. Something that runs on OpenCL/ROCm would be nice; something that runs on OpenCL/ROCm and CUDA would be even better. But at this point I'll settle for just about anything.

What are my options here? Do I even have options? Help me, ML gurus. You're my only hope.",4,7

I am starting third year in my University. I am required to complete and submit a minor project this semester. I have decided to get into Machine Learning field and hopefully submit my project in this domain. 

Here is the catch though: I can only submit my project written in C language. 

I want to build a movie recommendation system. I will be using [recommender library for C](https://github.com/GHamrouni/Recommender) to write my project. Does anyone here have any experience with this Library? 
And are ~240 man hours over the duration of 4 months enough to build this project (Only CLI, no GUI)?

Also I will have an option to expand this project for my Minor II using either Java/C++. How hard will it be to scale up this project?

I have some fairly decent experience in Java but I will have to brush up my C concepts.

I have yet to submit my project title to my department. I wanted opinion from you guys since you all are quite familiar in this domain.

Any input/suggestions from you guys would be fantastic. :)",0,1

I'm trying to learn more about feature selection after performing several submissions. The best score I got so far was with Logistic Regression, C=0.2, and using 2-degree polynomial features.

I feel this is not the right direction to continue making progress. I am trying to understand more about feature selections using Select From Model. For example, I tried using Random Forest and Gradient Boost to select the features. RF gave me 10 features to use. GB gave me 6.

So do I keep these features and pass them on to the same classifier? I tried that, and my submission got a lower score. Or do I keep those features and try them on different classifiers?

I can share some code snippets if it will help.

Also, what's a good way to grade the classifier? Accuracy? F1? ROC/AUC?

Specifically, DeepMind published [Noisy Networks for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295), while OpenAI published [Parameter Space Noise for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01905).  Both papers claim to produce superior results relative to previous work, but the papers were published within a month of each other. The DeepMind paper was published a few weeks later, and the authors do not try to compare the experimental results.  This is what the authors do have to say: 
>Most recently (and independently of our work), Plappert et al. [27] {edit: OpenAI's paper} presented a similar technique where constant Gaussian noise is added to the parameters of the network. Our method thus differs by the ability of the network to adapt the noise injection with time and it is not restricted to Gaussian noise distributions. It can also be adapted to any deep RL algorithm and we demonstrate this versatility by providing NoisyNet versions of DQN (value-based) [21] and A3C (policy based) [20] algorithms.

I'm curious if anyone has done or is currently working on something more than a surface-level analysis of the advantages to each approach.  One such surface-level: DeepMind's method is simpler and seems to require less hacking to work properly, but OpenAI's method has been shown to extend to high-dimensional discrete and continuous action spaces, (DeepMind only reports results on Atari).  Really looking forward to a comprehensive analysis.

Have any other papers attempted similar parametric noise methods and shown competing performance?",1,22

Hi all:  
Inspired by previous reddit that try to predict a sentence using first letters from each word, I develop a fast English input method for biomedical manuscript. It is trained on PubMed abstract and PMC full text.  
For each word the first letter must by typed and then followed by any number of letter. The following letter need not be continuous, but order should be maintained. for example:  
example=eple=eale=eme
after you typing one or more sentences in one line, the algorithm will translate them to correct biomedical English.  
It is just for fun.
a real example:  

famy ris of brt car bc are wel esed bu whr bc clus with oth cncr is les cen bu of ints for the indn of comn genc and pobl env facs contr to a genl can susy  

family risk of breast cancer bc are well established but whether bacterial cultures with other cancers is less challenging because of interest for the incidence of common genetic and possible environmental factors contributing to a general cancer susceptibility

Currently doing 1st year of 2 in Master in chemical engineering, my research topic is applying reinforcement learning to optimal control problems in smart grid energy management/demand-side management. 

I've been learning ML and RL for the past 3 years, can currently keep up with papers, implement these papers in Tensorflow, Pytorch and working on some additional personal projects (Deep RL related). 

Ultimately I'd like to work in a ML/RL research or applied position (non-academic, in private company research labs). My current worry is that my chem eng background is a bit of a non-traditional background, and I'm not sure how much of that will hinder my goal for getting the jobs I'm aiming for. (in my current round of internship hunting, I've gotten some call backs from startups, but nothing from the bigger companies for ML/RL research/engineering positions). I do notice that I'm still lacking in some CS fundamentals (i.e. getting past the algo/data struc interviews for these positions)

for my next steps after this Masters, besides applying for CS masters/PhDs, I'm currently looking at two additional options and would love any inputs you guys have:

1. Continue a PhD in chem eng, focused on controls, continue working on RL related research. Brush up on my CS fundamentals (algo & data struc, etc) and hopefully get some good internship positions with tech companies (the big guys or startups) doing ML research.

2. Enter a CS undergrad+masters combined, can finish in about 3 years with internships. See if I would like to pursue a PhD in CS after (most likely will given the need for PhD for many ML research positions).

I guess I'm curious as to how viable the first option is, as in how ""employable"" it is for internships for a PhD from a non-traditional chemical engineering background, but with research in related ML/RL area.

Appreciate any feedback!

I am in the planning phase of a computer build that I will be using to mess around with machine learning, and hopefully to perform some fun projects and/or undergraduate research in the coming years. I will probably go with a single GTX 1060 or 1070 to start, but i can foresee myself wanting to add another (not SLI) so I can train more than one model at once (hopefully doubling my own learning speed by allowing me to experiment more). From what I understand, this would require a CPU with more than 28 lanes *IF* I wanted to utilize both GPUs with full x16 connections.

My question is, how much performance difference *for machine learning* would there be between two gpus on x8 (or one on x16 and one on x8) and two gpus each with the full x16? Many posts that I have seen elsewhere claim that the difference is negligible, but these were mostly talking about gaming. I have also seen machine learning-specific blogs where people advocate getting a 40 lane cpu to avoid the supposed bottleneck of having to drop to 8 PCIe lanes for a GPU.

I am assuming (and hoping) that there is no need for a 40 lane CPU at this beginner/hobby level, but if it could cause a major bottleneck in the near future, I would probably rather shell out the cash. If it makes a difference, I have been using TensorFlow and I will probably check out PyTorch soon.

Thanks, and I hope this question makes sense! Also, any general tips for such a project would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR**
Building a budget computer for ML hobby, do I need a 40 lane CPU for a basic dual-gpu setup (or, are 16 PCIe lanes per GPU substantially better than 8)?

Some of the creators of spore were scientists and tried to have continuous zoom, including from galaxies to stars to planet to surface to the skin of a simulated animal to the cells the skin is made of to the atoms. Instead of continuous zoom, there are 5 levels of increasing size: cell, creature, tribal, civilization, space.

Of course the smaller parts wouldnt be simulated until observed. A convolutional neuralnet is a good example. There are videos of zooming in without limit, and various objects of the real world keep forming from a few adjacent pixels as they're zoomed into.

With AI we can automaticly imagine likely combinations of cells that a certain part of skin might be made of that would, for example, differ depending on how close a hair follicle is, and the genes of that animal. A sassafras tree has 3 kinds of leafs, so we could zoom into where a leaf is between choosing which kind to become, and maybe bend it and hold it there a while (or the environment it evolves in might do that) to change which of the 3 kinds of leafs it becomes. That could probably be easily simulated as cellular automata such as variations of smoothlife which forms similar shapes.

Something like Google Earth could handle the zoom between space and land.

OpenWORM is an example of simulating a whole life form at the resolution of some detail per cell, so they had to use a neuralnet on recorded brainwaves to predict those brainwaves, and it does look like a real worm squirming around.

Paul Falstad's website has lots of simulations of parts of physics including editable 3d molecule wavefunctions you can rotate and play with on screen.

We've made lots of progress since the creators of Spore gave up on continuous zoom. How might we try again?

I suggest designing an opensource framework that standardizes how any few plugins overlap during such zoom. For example, one plugin might simulate worm brainwaves, and another very approximately generate statistical spreads of the results of protein folding and the kind of cells it tends to form into, so the intersection between those would be displayed as molecules generated when observed, and those molecules would be electrified in the patterns of the worm brainwaves. There would have to be a sandbox layer (like javascript except also limiting compute cycles and memory, recursively) since so many systems (which would be downloaded automaticly depending where in the simulation you look next) cant all trust eachother. I think it could be done if people really wanted it, and is more a matter of arguing over how various simulations could be redesigned compatible with eachother.",12,0

I guess since it is different races it is not technically time series analysis, however I would like to at some point implement this live. Using the stats up until this moment in the race + all the historical information, predict the next 10 minutes.

He claims with no evidence that a) LSTM is not Turing complete and b) convolutional LSTM is Turing complete.

To me, this doesn't make sense.

Argument 1, based on simple RNNs, which are Turing complete (from Siegelmann / Sontag): In LSTM, choose gating weights s.t. all input gates are 1, all forget gates are 0, all output gates are 1. Then we basically have a simple RNN with a saturating squashing function, tanh(tanh(...)), which, even if not proved explicitly in literature, I can't imagine wouldn't end up being Turing complete, given the other literature on sigmoids vs. squashing functions in general. Even if we can't prove this, his claim seems overly strong, as he would have had to prove that they're not Turing complete.

Argument 2, under the assumption that convolutional LSTM is Turing complete: Convolutions are just matrix multiplies with special form, so all convolutional LSTMs can be expressed as LSTMs.

Am I missing something in these arguments?

I know that in the end representability isn't really what should occupy our minds these days (as opposed to learnability / data efficiency), but I still think Turing completeness is powerful and worth discussing.",37,27

I'm gaining a bit of traction on a side project I've been building for a little while around tutorials like this one: https://www.worldlybayes.com/tutorial_sample

The problem I'm looking to solve is that I see a lot of folks entering our field who have spent time learning algorithms and apis, but are missing critical skills needed to add value in companies (critical thinking, product sense, and systems design). I think this just do to lack of exposure and an absence of good examples (eg. there are lots of tutorials on how to use tensorflow for image recognition on MNIST, but very few on how to think about building a product around a deep learning model). So I've been writing a set of tutorials with more of a product development focus in the hopes that I can help out early career folks level up. The first 4 I have planned are:

- Building basic models (linked above)

- Generating feature hypotheses and iterating on a model

- Writing reusable and shareable code to get rid of cut and paste

- Using a database to back your modeling efforts

And then I'll see where it goes from there. I'm looking for feedback around the tutorials I've written: Are they understandable? Do they make sense? Do they seem useful? I'd like to make this as good as it can be and I think this group would be very helpful.

Thanks!",9,6

She has been tasked with explaining machine learning to others in the department; in particular her supervisor who struggles to turn on her computer in the morning!

After discussing it with me, and like all good internet users, she decided to use a cat analogy and I wondered if anyone had any thoughts, suggestions or feedback:


&gt; Can you train a cat and a computer?
&gt; 
&gt; In my research I am hoping to use an e-Research technique called 'machine learning' to identify and extract recipes from about 30 years of newspaper and magazine articles. However, as soon as I say machine learning to many in my faculty, I get blank and often bored looks back.
&gt; 
&gt; So, working from the standpoint that machine learning is understandable to all and that everything computing can be explained with reference to cats . . . here is my attempt:
&gt; 
&gt; This is my cat Trilby. She is 17 years old, a moggy and adored beyond the point which is humanly rational. While Trilby finds us acceptable humans (mostly), her main love in life is food. If Trilby had her way, she'd have an endless supply of biscuits in her bowl and would spend the rest of her time in a food coma. Trying to be responsible humans however, we only feed her twice a day.
&gt; 
&gt; Originally, I fed Trilby in the morning, as soon as I got up. Over several iterations of my getting up and feeding her Trilby *learnt* the parameters of breakfast. A pattern was established, the training was repeated several times and she learnt a new behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; This worked really well . . . for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, after a time, Trilby also learnt another cue - if I woke up earlier, she got fed earlier. So, she started waking me up earlier and earlier, I would get up and feed her, the training would be reinforced. Until the morning when at 4.00am she woke me up by slipping her paw under the duvet and swiped my hip *with her claws out*. I can tell you this is not a good way to wake up.
&gt; 
&gt; The training had gone awry and we needed to come up with a new training model. So, rather than my feeding her as soon as I got up, my partner started feeding her *after* he'd had a shower. We all struggled with this new training model at first, but over several iterations Trilby learnt the new pattern of behaviour and does not wake my partner (or myself) in the morning.
&gt; 
&gt; This is just the kind of model I will be using in machine learning. At the moment, my computer can't recognise recipes. So, I will give it some cues and parameters and over several iterations of training, much as Trilby learnt the cues for breakfast, my computer will learn to identify a recipe. Then, once my computer has learnt what a recipe looks like, I can leave it to process my magazine and newspaper article download and find the recipes for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Machine learning is not magic, it is yet another process of learning, it's just my computer which is learning, rather than myself or my cat. Training occurs through small, simple iterative steps, which gives it the ability to process more complex tasks  in this case recognising recipes.

I wonder why many recent papers using RNN don't use latest tricks like multiplicative integration or layernorm, or embedding improvements (like removing first components)

Are the contributions of those overstated ? 

I also wonder whether I should use them in my own research because it don't isolate my contributions (for instance it might be multiplicative integration that improve my results over other results, and I would have to replicate other papers with multiplicative integration to do a fair comparison). But if everyone keep using vanilla LSTM, it might slow down the research.

What's your take on this ? I never saw a thread about this question

Do I have a bug , is it a matter of tweaking hyperparameters, or is the algorithm simply not that suited for these problems?

My implementation is here, if someone is interested in implementing themselves or is kind enough to check for bugs :)

My specific use case, which I've encountered multiple times, is some per country per year data. What I'd like to do, and is trivial to do in keras, is create a model that operates on per-country data, and fit it with as many examples as there are countries. This way, the model can use the same parameters with mutiple examples, and is way more robust. 

However, when I want to use e.g. ARIMA, GARCH and so on, most of the packages are obviously written with a single dimension time series in mind. Best case scenario, a VAR model predicts time series of higher dimensions. However, those all require *single* time series.

Why is that? Is there any package that supports panel data? Is there a pytorch/tf implementation of ARIMA?",5,5

Like, for example, if cluster you are given access to is not full of GPU's, but Intel Xeon Phi's (my case), and it runs Scientific Linux with outdated glibc, installing Tensorflow with optimizations will be absolute pain in the ass, as it would require enormous amount of time. With Theano? Theano with Intel optimizations and MPI is there. This is one of reasons I would stick to Theano, apart from it being academia-made library.

765,2017-8-19,2017,8,19,22,6up1jr,[D] Recommendations for raw audio signal processing models,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6up1jr/d_recommendations_for_raw_audio_signal_processing/,danielrothmann,1503149232,"Hi all,

I've been working to implement a machine learning algorithm that operates on raw audio. The goal is to process audio samples with an algorithm according to arbitrary data and trained with another raw audio ""truth sequence"". Specifically, we are trying to compute spatialized reverb as a consequence of input audio and head rotation.

So far, I have developed a tool for playing back a source audio file and simultaneously recording the audio in the room along with head orientation captured from a HTC Vive. The next step is to decide on a proper model for the ML algorithm.

Suppose these are the parameters in question:


// Inputs: 

Source audio = 1D float array of size n

Head orientation = 3D (x,y,z) float array of size n

// Evaluation: 

Microphone audio = 1D float array of size n

Loss is calculated as the mean square error between source and microphone audio sequences

// Outputs: 

Processed audio = 1D float array of size n which is a product of input audio in combination with head orientation 


I'm still green in the ML domain, so I hope you'll bear with me. Looking for models, I've dug into projects such as Wavenet and SampleRnn, though these seem to be intended for a generative approach rather than signal processing. It might also be that they can be adapted for our purpose, but that I'm lacking understanding to make that happen. We are looking for something relatively efficient that can process raw audio with an understanding of the time domain. That would indicate dilated CNN's, RNN's or LSTM's, right?

The potential of something like this is quite interesting in the audio domain, as it could also be applied in backward engineering effects, analog gear, noise reduction etc. So I'd be very interested to hear if something along these lines exists or is being researched.

If anyone has ideas or inputs that might lead me us in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated!",10,5

So I've already purchased a **GTX 1080** at a good deal. While I'm waiting for it to arrive, I've been ceaselessly pondering on what CPU best serves my needs. 

Since I'm a grad student, I'm trying to squeeze the whole thing into ~$1200USD, with half already spent on the GPU.

I've read a ton of resources (probably most stemming from Tim Dettmers' amazing blog) saying that CPU isn't that important for DL, but other code I run, e.g. data pre-processing, augmentation, analysis would still be using CPU. I use Python for everything, with lots of Numpy use. I've only been considering Intel products, due to MKL being so fast. Only benchmark I've seen for e.g. Ryzen is [this](https://openbenchmarking.org/showdown/pts/numpy). I should say I'm currently not experienced with multithreading, but learning.

I've been considering a couple of different routes. The build below includes a standard current-gen CPU that I imagine will do the job well. However, it offers no scaling, having max 16PCIe lanes. On the other hand, I could go for an older-gen Xeon with 40 PCIe lanes, like the option described below. These will run on an older architecture, and also with lower clock speed. However, the can offer 8 cores/16 threads for half the price of the 4-core Kaby lake i5.

The thing that has been on my mind is, I have also found a good deal on a **Xeon 2670 (Sandy Bridge)** and **GA-X79-UP4** locally at a lower price than the combo listed above. 

**Advantages:**

* Such a system, it seems to  me, is capable of handling a much larger workload. 
* More memory channels, higher bandwidth - I guess this is good for DL? Since you need to transfer information to GPU quickly? Not an expert.
* More memory capacity and slots on LGA2011 boards
* 40 PCIe lanes + LGA2011 boards will allow me to expand to a mutli-GPU system.

**Now for the drawbacks**:

* I am very concerned that it is rather old at this point. LGA2011 boards seem difficult to find and replace. Also, no warranty on any part.
* I won't be using a multi-GPU setup for the foreseeable future (at leas the year), so the 40PCIe lanes are nice, but I'd probably go for a more recent processor as their prices drop more.
* I won't be running dual 2670s since the electricity bills will be insane, and I'll need to fork out for a much more expensive mobo.
* Older motherboard, won't be able to go for nice new things in the future, like M.2 SSD

What do you feel is a more appropriate option for my needs? I'm also open to cheaper suggestions.",42,20

This is the first time I've tried an implementation given in the paper and that too partially. I've given the relevant links to the paper and dataset in the README.

**Questions:**

1. With all the parameters set in my code (which are a little different with respect to optimizers and activation functions used), I am getting an accuracy of **83.77%** on validation data (I've split the train, validation with validation size of 0.2) . Whereas in the paper with it's own MLP implementation, they've got a max accuracy score of **80.21%**. 

So is it safe to say that my model is better than mentioned? It(accuracy) always seems like an abstract concept to me considering no ""right"" answer. 

**Follow up question**: If the implementation is wrong or doesn't make sense, then what's wrong in the parameters, optimizers, activation or loss functions that I've chosen? 

Desperate for your insights. Thank you.

If this isn't a reasonable post for this subreddit, I apologize!)

This coming quarter I'll be taking [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) (as an [SCPD](http://scpd.stanford.edu/programs) student)!  As a brief introduction, I was a Cal EECS+Math undergrad, and I've been in industry as a software engineer for almost 10 years.  I'm looking to take this course to get a rigorous theoretical approach to ML, with the intention of applying it to industry and to build on it by taking more related CS courses going forward.

I had a few questions for people who have taken the course before, as well as a few for those who are also taking the course.  I looked over the course reviews from the last few offerings on, and the overwhelming feedback can be summed up as: 1) tons of time will be required, 2) the ""know a bit of linear algebra and probability"" prerequisite is a woeful understatement, and 3) start on the problem sets and project as early as possible.

**If you've taken CS229 before:**

* Are the lecture notes on the [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) properly up to date?  From briefly reviewing the first few, I've noticed some errors and wasn't sure if I should make note of them to let the instructor(s) know.
* If you had watched some of the lectures on the SEE website, how closely were the actual lectures to these? 
* What other resources (videos, other courses, textbooks, etc.) did you find helpful for the class?  (Either as preparation before it began, or referenced during class)
* There was mention of many ""mathematical tricks"" needed for the homework.  Can you give an example, to show what lines of thinking will be required?

**For those taking the course:**

* What (if any) preparation have you done?
 * Clearly the SEE website is an incredible resource, and I've watched the first few lectures, as well as read through the corresponding course notes.
 * I've also briefly gone through the Linear Algebra and Probability review PDFs, and intend to go over them again in more detail.
 * I Also took the much vaunted [Coursera ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) this summer to get an overview of related topics.
* Are there any on-campus groups/honor societies which organize any kind of study groups?
* One of the course reviews for a previous quarter states: ""Get in a PSet group. You all help each other learn."" With this in mind, are there any like-minded students in the Bay Area interested in forging our own study sessions (if it would be beneficial) and/or working on problem sets?
* For SCPD students: is there any kind of group/forum/etc. to talk about these kinds of things?  Would such a place even be useful, given there aren't (too) many of us?

Any details about the above (or other things you think I should know) would be helpful!  If anyone knows of a better place to find answers to these questions, let me know as well.",1,11

The Player has a ""view cone"" in which there either is food or is not. The problem is, that the number of foods in his view can vary. What I did until now:

Only use the clostest food, pass as paramaeters the distance to the food and the angle at which he sees it (i.e. two numbers). If there is no food in his view, pass some default values (-10,-10). This doesn't work very well. As soon as the agent does not see food he goes crazy which makes sense to me.

My other idea is to have seperate models for any number of foods he sees but that seems pretty complicated and unflexible in case I want to have even more different options than only 1 food or 0 food.

Do you guys have any tips or ideas how I could proceed here?

First-time poster here. I've been doing some machine learning stuff on the side for the past few months. I primarily do genomic research. To give you a little background there are things called conservation graphs that show how well a certain base pair is kept over time during evolution (sometimes over just one species, sometimes over different species from the same tree etc.). I had the idea to create a GAN that would create motifs(small sequences of around 200 base pairs in this case) and generate new motifs of the same class. 

Any feedback on the idea or pointing me in the direction to start writing this would be appreciated!

I would like to plug my own project, a backend neutral version of the Neural Turing Machine as a Keras recurrent layer.

The project resulted out of the need of at least *one* working implementation of the NTM for a modern high level library like tensorflow or keras, as I had to give a talk for a seminar about that. Frustrated I tried to fix the problem.

My implementation has a few features:

* It allows you to pass arbitrary Keras models as controllers (as long as they adhere to some rules described in the API). If no model is passed, a single dense layer is used (maybe in future LSTM).
* A lot of time went into optimising robustness, with some degree of success.
* It is accompanied with, I think, quite a lot of documentation, including a 6-pages .pdf roughly explaining the principle and discussing implementation difficulties and a #comment to code ratio which is about 1.
* Its very easy to use.


How easy? Well, you can just use it as a recurrent layer, and the hyperparameters are more or less only the width, depth of the memory and the controller architecture.
To be honest, I try to sell the shortcoming that it has no support for arbritray number of read and write heads yet (currently one of each) as a feature ;)



I see a future for it being used as a enhanced replacement of LSTM, so please enjoy!


https://github.com/flomlo/ntm_keras/tree/master


Please note that I would be happy about any kind constructive critique about the documentation. I've worked the last month on the project, I still have a hard time to figure out what is trivial to newcomers and what is not.

A new version which supports multiple head and more freedom in the activation function is about to be released. Yay!",4,31

Maybe a very small step.

But people simulation brain activity (as e.g. the Human Brain Project) usually simulate their stuff time step based, i.e. they simulate every signal with the time it needs to reach its target. In particular, not every neuron is firing at the same timestep, as in our interpretation of neural nets, where every neuron fires at the same time with a certain intensity, enabling us to do ultrafast deduction via matrix products.

Now my question is: Has the difference arising through timestep-based (asynchronous) approach and ""all at once, at the same time, all hail matrix products""-approach ever been theoretically analyzed for differences in expressiveness?

I use expressiveness as lack of a better word. I'm not really interested in rough terms like Turing completeness or something like.



EDIT:

I apologize for being vague on the idea of ""expressiveness"". I will try to explain it more: Although that I'm aware that sampling exists and (R)NN are turing-complete, not everythin that is easy in theory is also easy in practise.

For example: We certainly now that every NP-hard problem can be solved with a conventional deterministic Turing machine. But for the most problems finding a solution with a nondeterministic TM is trivial, and with a TM it isnt, one has to perform a tree search or something.

So in the end what I mean could probably formulated like that: Are there known problems which are easy on SNN, but hard for conventional NN?

I hope you understand my question, I know its not perfectly worded, but it is a question which has been lingering at the back of my head for quite some time now.

In case this might not be the right subreddit for that kind of debate, I ask for forgiveness and maybe a pointer in the right direction.

Moreover, the quality (PSNR) of a tested solution is compared with the reference solution - upsampling with bicubic interpolation - which is done again with MatLab imresize() function with the default settings. 

As the result the train DB should be prepared preliminary (not on-the-fly) using MatLab. Reference bicubic also should be done inside MatLab.

The proposed implementation tries to avoid using MatLab imresize() with bicubic interpolation. It works bit exact in my settings (MatLab R2015b), and needs only numpy.

I am really interested in ML and already have a fair amount of knowledge to work with (completed Andrew Ng's course), knowledge of tensorflow, ANN, CNN etc. and on top of that of course I am willing to learn along the way. I am looking for suggestions for a potential ML project that I can pursue in my third year for my IP. One project idea I had in mind, but was told it lacked substance by friends was to create an electronic eye. So I would use a R pi for example, and make an eye that can react to a dynamic visual environment so I could show it objects and it would be able to classify what it sees, but also have a learning mode where if It cannot correctly classify an object I can make it learn what that object is. Also I would want to include maybe emotion detection at a basic level and would also be looking into making a mechanical eye that can blink /respond to stimuli like a human eye would (I guess this is basically a camera and a computer though?). feedback on this project as well as any completely new suggestions for other ML projects are greatly appreciated. This is my first ever post on Reddit so please go easy on me if I did anything wrong!

I've just released keras-surgeon, a network pruning library for Keras implemented in python. I'd love some feedback on it!

A few months ago I wanted to experiment with pruning neural network channels and discovered that there wasn't really a straightforward way to do that.  
Seeing as I wanted to get some more python experience under my belt, I have implemented a solution. The aim is to facilitate repeating academic studies, applying their findings to real problems or doing new research using Keras.

It can be installed using: 
 
    pip install kerassurgeon.

Source code + documentation (see readme): [https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon](https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon)

Features of this implementation:
* Its very easy to use
* It should work for any network architecture
* The majority of Keras layers are fully supported
* It supports other network surgery: deleting, inserting and replacing layers.

Things that need work:
* It seems pretty slow to me, pruning a complex network such as Inception V3 takes a couple of minutes. However, that is not very long compared to most networks training times.
* Not all Keras layers are fully supported (see the readme).

I hope this will help more people experiment with network pruning!
  
  
Note:
Only one simple method for selecting which channels to prune is currently implemented in keras-surgeon. There is plenty of interesting research on the topic.

Probably clearest through an example:

Let's say we want to predict sentiment from speech, and we have data from 10 people. And we know which recordings came from which people.

Now let's say person 7 always sighs when he or she is unhappy, and that we do not expect this to generalize to other people. We'd like our model to ignore these sighs, and instead rely entirely on other properties of the speech signal, and in particular on properties which generalize over speakers.

More generally, let's say I have reason to believe that *no* speaker-specific properties should be used to predict sentiment. I can imagine addressing this by penalizing intermediate features based on their ability to predict the speaker.

I've been working (in collaboration with others) on this R package [accSDA](https://github.com/gumeo/accSDA), (accelerated sparse discriminant analysis), which is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/accSDA/index.html). The research behind this has mostly been application of alternative optimization approaches, which are considerably faster than the traditional approach (old version available as an R package [sparseLDA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparseLDA/index.html)). I am currently looking for feedback on the package.

**What problem does this package solve?**

This algorithm solves supervised classification problems with multiple classes, where the number of variables can be considerably larger than the number of samples, i.e. *p&gt;&gt;n* problems. The underlying optimization problem that is solved is called *sparse optimal scoring*. This is achieved with an elastic net regularizer.

What the algorithm essentially does, is that it finds the best projection of the data, to a lower dimensional space (representation) for linear separation. These projection vectors the method finds, (discriminant vectors), can be sparse, meaning that the algorithm ""chooses"" the most promising variables to use for the projection, I.e. the ones that matter for the task at hand. After the selection of variables, you can also use another classification algorithm, so you can use this in a sense as a supervised version of sparse PCA, or you can just classify according to the nearest centroid. The dimensionality reduction is better than PCA, because we use the labels, I.e. it is supervised, we are looking for the directions of variation that separate our classes.

I have several example use cases, but the examples in the accompanying paper are rather convincing. Here are a couple of other ones:

  1) I have used this to [detect foreign objects in multispectral X-ray images of food items](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59126-1_29). To summarize, these images are like regular images, except each pixel has 128 channels instead of just 3 for red green and blue. So for each pixel we have a spectrogram, that gives a measure of the material composition of the sample. I can release the code for this article and some example data if there is interest.

  2) I used this in a machine learning competition on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/indeed-ml-codesprint-2017), the *indeed* challenge. The task was to create a multilabel classifier to tag job descriptions for tags like, BSc degree needed, 5+ years experience needed, etc. In this case I just used the method to select the best terms from my document term matrix and I fed that to xgboost. I was pretty satisfied with my performance, since I am no expert on NLP problems and this was my second ML codesprint. I ended up in the 25th place and got a t-shirt :)

The feedback I am mostly looking for is:

  1) Can you get this to work? Was it hard or easy? Is the documentation clear? Should I add more examples?

  2) Would a semi-supervised version be interesting?

  3) Would a sparse ordinal classifier be interesting? I.e. ordinal labels.

  4) A C++ backend for the R package, that could also be used as a backend for a python implementation.

  5) Any quirks you want to see fixed?

Hope I get some feedback!

Also, if there is another subreddit where this would be relevant, I would like to hear about that!

In my searching it was pretty clear that there were quite a few other people who were totally lost.

So, I stumbled through it and thought I would share a true step-by-step tutorial covering how it's done, by creating a custom macaroni and cheese object detector. Hopefully I can save some other people some time in this process.

I am personally super excited about this Object Detection API from TF. In practice, you can use as low as 100 images for a new object, train for ~1 hr, and have great results. That's really awesome. 

I'll post a breakdown so you can skip through stuff you already know:

So I suppose if there is something to take out as an amateur is, do not claim it is interesting and just explain your idea because not getting any feedbacks means you are probably doing something wrong.

Hello r/MachineLearning,

To be short (edit: not so much at posteriori), I am a young software engineer (although I was trained as an applied mathematician (master)) with a passion for machine learning (reading a fair amount of papers on my free time). I believe to have found an efficient algorithm for computing the natural gradient of a neural network (with no approximation of the fisher matrix estimate, I just don't inverse it, it is ""Fisher-free"" in a sense). By efficient I mean it is asymptotically O(WB^2 ) where W is the number of weights and B is the batch size used for the Fisher/gradient estimation, and I believe the ""constant in front"" small enough to have a little/reasonable impact relative to the back-propagation. 

What should I do with it ? Should I write a blog post without somebody reviewing it first ? Should I contact authors of papers who wrote on this topic (I have read some of their work for some of them) ?

Note, as context, I am currently a C++ back-end developer (doing some front-end as well, and a fair bit of linux scripting) my work isn't related to ML. I wasn't really serious about it but I always had the idea at the back of my mind that I might be trying to get into a PhD sometimes or apply to Google Brain residency program (with realistically little hope to get in but it can't harm to try). I definitely have some research ideas that I would like to explore. 

Second note; I have never used any of the modern ML framework (beside trying tensorflow C++ API once, bazel felt quite slow), and my old 40$ AMD GPU is good enough to be toying around with GLSL fragment shaders but not exactly build for CNNs training. But I feel familiar enough with theory and modern C++ to be able to implement a small ANN library to test the algorithm (hopefully fairly quickly, with for main limitation my amount of free time).

Thank you very much in advance for your advices (and sorry about the unreasonable amount of parenthesis (and of uses of the word 'amount')).

Cheers !

p.s: Sorry for the people who have seen the first post, but I read the post rules a bit too late to notice the tag was needed or the post would be removed.",17,10

Stack them vertically in the following way. When you stack Resnet(i+1) on Resnet(i), the input layer of the former overlaps the last hidden layer of the latter rather than its output layer, and the output layer is kept, so that we can train each 100 layers using its own loss function. Note that the number of units in the overlapped layers has to coincide for this, and that it's better to update the weights of Resnet(i) once and those of Resnet(i+1) once and so on than to train Resnet(i) completely and then Resnet(i+1) completely. For updating the weights of Resnet(i), you fix the weights of Resnet(j) (j&lt;i) and ignore Resnet(k) (k&gt;i) altogether.

It also offers an alternative, deep approach to face alignment: training a CNN to regress 6DoF 3D head pose directly from image intensities. The CNN was trained using pose labels estimated on CASIA faces using a facial landmark detection method. The trained CNN actually performed better than the facial landmark detection method used to produce its training labels.

I'm taking the GRE in a few weeks and I need to know where I should send my scores. I've always known since the beginning that I wanted to study machine learning or AI. I've tried looking for schools to go study machine learning at a graduate level but many listed schools (including here on reddit) are the top tier computer science programs in the country/world. Now I'm a good student and I expect to score really well on the GRE but I'm also a realist. It is unlikely that I will get into somewhere like Toronto, MIT or the University of Maryland and even more unlikely that I will get financial aid. So I guess my question is this; what are some universities with really good machine learning/AI graduate programs but may not be the best of the best in computer science? Some place where I can still get a good education in what I want but also get in and perhaps get financial aid? Going international could be an option but seeing as how I only speak English going somewhere that doesn't have a program mainly in English is going to be a problem. Any advice is welcome but if an extended conversation is preferable I would not be against a PM where I could possibly get more details about a program or where I should look. Thanks in advance for any information you can provide. ",5,3

I was thinking to do something with facial recognition which detects new faces and says something using TTS to them (as well as showing the recently detected faces on the edge of the screen).

The limitation I have is that I only have a low-end i5 MacBook Air (and I *absolutely* don't want to use Core ML) for this demo (along with an external Webcam and an Intel RealSense world-facing camera if it's *really* needed for this). I can't run a neural network on this, so it has to be something hosted (preferably on Watson, HP HavenOnDemand, or something similar as opposed to AWS GPU instances which are costly to run), although a few dollars of spending is ok.

Does anybody have any recommendations?",3,2

Everything I've found on it was a year old. The conclusions at that time seemed to be:

Keras was very standard, easy, and adaptable to any backend but slow

TensorLayer was a less modular but more complex, faster and featured version of keras

TF Learn wasn't heavily used compared to the above so I couldn't find a ton of comparison, aside from being the cleanest, least modular, and least configurable

TF Slim was viewed as very promising and interesting and as possibly the field dominator, but was too easy to use at this time.

How has that changed in the past year?

1299,2017-8-31,2017,8,31,22,6x6tln,[P] Artemis: A Python package for Organizing your ML Experiments,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6x6tln/p_artemis_a_python_package_for_organizing_your_ml/,treebranchleaf,1504185733,"Often when we run experiments in machine learning, we end up in a big mess with lots of saved results from lots of differently parameterized versions of various experiments.

To avoid this pandemonium, we (the QUVA lab in Amsterdam) have made [Artemis](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis) as a tool to automate a lot of the things that you often end up doing when running machine learning experiments.  And now that it's reasonably mature, we'd like to share it with the world!

Artemis removes the need for oft-repeated coding tasks such as:

- Writing argparsers to specify experiment settings from the console
- Manually saving results to disk and loading them for later analysis/plotting.
- Keeping track of which results came from which parametrization of which experiment.
- Downloading data from the internet and keeping a local cache for future use.
- Saving a list of past console-commands required to reproduce various experiments.  
- Capturing console output and saving to disk.
- Creating live plots of variables as they evolve for debugging purposes.

To use, you decorate your main function with a `@experiment_function` decorator, like

    @experiment_function
    def demo_mnist_mlp(
        minibatch_size = 10,
        learning_rate = 0.1,
        hidden_sizes = [300],
        seed = 1234,
        ....
        ):
    ...

Then you can create ""variants"" on this experiment: e.g.

    demo_mnist_mlp.add_variant('full-batch', minibatch_size = 'full', n_epochs = 1000)
    demo_mnist_mlp.add_variant('deep', hidden_sizes=[500, 500, 500, 500])

You can ""run"" the experiment, and its variants. e.g.

    demo_mnist_mlp.get_variant('deep').run()

When you run an experiment all console output, figures, and the return value are saved to disk, so the results can be reviewed later.
 
Artemis includes a simple command-line user interface to help you run your experiments and view their results, which you open by calling `.browse()`, e.g.

    demo_mnist_mlp.browse()

See a [complete example](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis/blob/master/artemis/examples/demo_mnist_logreg.py), or [the documentation](http://artemis-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/experiments.html) for more.

Artemis has the same purpose as [Sacred](http://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but aims be more intuitive and make it easier to create and compare many variations on experiments.

And for a little icing on the cake, Artemis includes an extremely handy live-plotting function called `dbplot`, which is built on top of matplotlib.  Say you have some variable in your code that you want to keep a live plot of.  Just insert `dbplot(data, 'my_var')` into your code.  `dbplot` will figure out what kind of plot to make (you can of course also choose manually), and update the plot on every subsequent call.  [See example](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis/blob/master/artemis/plotting/demo_dbplot.py)

You can get Artemis from [https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis).  We'd welcome any feedback or contributions.

**Note: Artemis was developed for Python 2.7.  We hope to extend support to Python 3 soon.**",29,69

It seems to me that it is poorly explained. More specifically, authors do not clarify what is the difference between ""closest fit"" and ""closest fit in population"".  The line indicating model bias and estimation bias are misleading since they should go from ""truth"" to ""closest fit"" and not from ""truth"" to ""closest fit in population"", as defined in equation 7.14. Also, whats the point of the line from ""realization"" to ""closest point in population""? Thank you very much",2,2
