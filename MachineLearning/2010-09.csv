My goal is to detect the topic (i.e. Technology, Health, etc..) of a given article based on it's top keywords.

My plan was to manually attribute a topic for a given amount of articles then write a script which would automatically classify other articles based keyword score.

For instance if I have an article who's top keywords are: ""machine learning"", ""artificial intelligence"" and I manually set the topic to ""Technology"" then those keywords would get +1 for technology.

The problem is whenever a new keyword appears, I won't be able to classify the article automatically as the keyword will be unknown to the system.

Is there another way of doing this?

Thanks :)",10,10
