I'm trying to decide if this is for real. The part that really wowed me was at 19:30, as it reminded me of that scene in Transformers where the Mini-con possesses a gadget.

The central idea seems to be some sort of a 'conscious' computer network modeled on the human brain called the ""Creativity Machine"", which works through the strengthening/weakening of synapse-like connections between nodes, using things called ""perceptrons"" (critics) and ""imagitrons"" (idea generators). New ideas are generated by introducing noise into the system.

The machine has general intelligence rather than domain-specific intelligence. For example, it writes music, designs superconductors, invents commercial products, etc.

I failed to find any good discussions on it from Google, and I am not an expert in the field, so I was hoping for some insights. The video is from 2006, which is admittedly a bad sign, and the discussion moves to ""cosmic consciousness""-type stuff towards the end.

Overall, I found the video to be fascinating but extremely vague, and was disappointed by the dearth of available online literature.

EDIT: (from http://newmedia.wikia.com/wiki/Stephen_Thaler)  
&gt;Stephen Thaler, of Imagination Engines, Inc., in St. Charles, MO, is a pioneer in the area of artificial intelligence and the inventor of the Creativity Machine Paradigm. This system consists of an artificial neural network that is perturbed by noise so as to seed the generation of new ideas and strategies. Another neural network acts as a critic selecting good from bad results and steering the perturbed network in the most promising directions. According to Tina Hesman the Creativity Machine was used to design a wealth of commercially available products. She also reports that the device has been mainly used by the US military to design new weapons. Dennis Bushnell, NASA's leading visionary has called the Creativity Machine ""AI's Best Bet"" at creating human to trans-human intelligence in machines.

I guess there is some substance here :)

Assuming that the answer is yes to both questions, how do we make EAs to discover this from previous training runs? Like, somehow bias the operators and initial population from previous results.

This is a very primitive example how experience accumulated between runs can be beneficial. There might as well be other features on the fitness landscape that can be exploited to get better solutions.

We have started 18 months ago the MASH project, which aims at designing collaboratively large families of image features for pattern recognition.

The rationale behind the project is that increasing the complexity of a feature set almost systematically reduces prediction error rates, and that a collaborative development is the key to massively increase that complexity.

The open platform is accessible at

    http://mash-project.eu/

There you can create a user account and upload image feature extractors written in C++ (that we call ""heuristics""). You can also check the existing feature extractors already in the system to serve as examples for your own.

By default, the code you upload will remain private, and the system will run a few small-scale pattern recognition experiments using Boosting to assess performance of your features. If you decide to make your submissions public, then they will be included in large-scale experiments, and be available to everybody under the GPL2 license.

You can download an SDK which is compatible with Linux, Windows, and OS X, and check the documentation and screen cast tutorials on the web site.

Please contact me for any comment or remark.
