I am implementing a DRBM following this paper: http://machinelearning.org/archive/icml2008/papers/601.pdf

I am stuck on p(y | h), the difficulty I am having is with dy and dy^, what would be examples of those values? I know that d represents the biases of the class units, but what exactly would dy^ be? I speculate that dy could simply be the product of d and c , where c is the desired class and I am thinking dy^ could be the sum of the products of d and all possible c.

All that aside, I have also started looking at this now: https://dslpitt.org/uai/papers/11/p463-louradour.pdf

And in this paper, p(y=ec | h) has a different form. Which would you recommend? And why are they different?

I am try to identify the best predictive model that yields accurate probabilities of positives (the data's labels are binary) on a severely imbalanced data set.  

I have 2 main problems.

1. Different loss functions tell me different models are better. In particular I get a 2-5% better ROC-AUC loss if I go with model 1 over model 2.  However, I get a 7 to 20% better Log loss if I go with model 2 over model 1.  The RMSE is 1% better for model 2.  I realize log-loss and rmse are ""well calibrated"", however because the data is so imbalanced, I am concerned that these loss functions will be more impacted by noise in the data.  Also, I do care to some degree about how well the predictions are ordered (another reason to favor AUC).

2. I am not sure I am doing Log and RMSE loss calculations correctly.  Because the data is severely imbalanced (the ratio of positives to negatives is about 1 to 1000), the data i work with is pre-filtered before I get it to remove 99 out of every 100 negative training instances (and I can't get the removed instances later). During training time, I give all instances equal weight, but when I calculate model losses during cross validation, I give negative instances a compensatory weight of 100 and positive instances a weight of 1. My concern is that this weighting scheme is wrong for a number of reasons.  For one I am concerned it will encourage overfitting to the few negative examples that didn't get removed by downsampling.  Second, I worry that it only makes sense to evaluate a model on a test data set that uses the same weighting scheme as the training data.  

Any thoughts and advice would be greatly Appreciated.

So I had this idea for my term paper: use EEG, transform the recordings using STFT and trying to use that as a more computation friendly representation of the data in training the network. However I ran into a problem: discrete Fourier series of a single STFT are [n by 3] vectors (where n is the number of harmonics) and as far as I know, that can't be used to train ANN's. You need one training example to be a row/column vector. Has anyone else encountered such a problem and/or has any idea how to come up with a solution, a suitable data representation, if any?

Computing this distance function is reasonably expensive.  Note that I do not have a vector representation for each node, I only have a distance function.  

My interest is in getting something like normalized graph cuts.  I.e. I want a way of cutting my graph into roughly connected components.  

One strategy that I have tried is picking a cutoff k and then doing a search for connected components.  In practice this scales in close to linear time, as it quickly puts many of the nodes into a few clusters and they don't need to be searched multiple times (so in practice I only need to compute a tiny fraction of the whole distance matrix over all nodes).  The results are also reasonably good for my task, but it is brittle because of the hard threshold.  

Alternatively, I've tried doing spectral clustering and DBSCAN.  These also work well and are much less britle than a hard search.  However they require me to compute the full distance matrix, which is prohibitively expensive.  

One way I could do it is by first running a search for connected components at threshold k1.  Then try to merge the clusters using a different (and lower) threshold k2, but requiring at least two matches to merge the clusters.

In some sense the Mankind appears to be replaceable by machines in many fields, but I do not pose this question in a luddist sense, because I think that if machines can do better that job, they should do it instead of us and it will be better for all.
This question is because I thought a few weeks ago that Mathematic could be relatively safe from all these futurible changes in society and that the job of mathematicians would be one of those which could be saved, like other artistic and creative jobs like writer, poet or, maybe, philosopher. But my thoughts changed suddenly a few days ago and I become depressed because I hoped that pure Mathematic belongs to those disciplines which would constitute the last redoubt of Mankind-necessity, although helped by computers and calculators. However, my latest readings on the last advances on Information Theory, Automata Theory, Computability Theory, Computational Complexity Theory, Theoretical Computer Science, Theory of Computation and Logic have shown me the possibility of a Mathematic done only by computers working syntactically or even semantically with axioms and models in first-order or higher-order predicative, deductive or modal logics developed. I thought, like many other mathematicians, that this almost Hilbertian statement could not be achieved because of Gdel's incompleteness theorems, but this asseveration which seems to save Mathematic from a full computerization it's not true because these theorems are true in the first-order axiomatization of arithmetics (Peano) which is not complete, but some (if not all) the second-order or higher-order axiomatizations of arithmetics are complete and these theorems do not apply and, although our computers nowadays only are advanced in first-order automatic deduction, nothing impedes the existence of future computers, which could work in higher-order logics or exotic axiomatizations, solve the most important open problems in Mathematic and prove theorems which Mankind never could imagine; and, in this case, what would be the role of human mathematicians? In fact, would they have any role? Can we save Mathematic for humans? Is there any theoretical or technical impediment which avoids this terrible final? If not, How could we help the machines in do Mathematic? What is, finally, the last role of Mankind in developing Mathematic?
I'm not searching only in terms of time of computation or deduction. I do not care if a computer takes longer than human being to prove a theorem or to solve a problem, but if it can do all things that we do or even more. If we can save Mathematic for Mankind, what have us that computers have not and vice versa?

In other words, you might have Sample 1 be ""attempted 25 times and succeeded five times"", while Sample 2 is ""attempted 12 times and succeeded once"".

Unfortunately, the number of times the attempts are made varies greatly.  For some samples it may be as high as 300 attempts, while for others it is only a single attempt.  For those larger numbers we have a decent amount of confidence in the overall performance of that sample, but for the single attempt samples we have almost none.

When I try to use this data to build a model, the model becomes heavily biased by samples that have single attempts that are successful.  So far my solution has just been to drop any samples with less than a minimum number of attempts (I have arbitrarily chosen 10), but this results in a significant loss of samples (around 30%).

1) Split the training csv into two files using a random 70/30 split, ideally a different split for each training run
2) Use a generator to yield the lines in the resulting files for one-by-one encoding
3) Use another generator to feed the output of the previous generator into sklearn for training / xvalidation.
4) Use another dual generator setup on the test data set to write out predictions

While there is still a lot to be done on both projects, I think they have reached a point where they start to look promising. Highlights include:

- Since CUDArray imitates NumPy, its user interface is well-known to NumPy-programmers.
- CUDArray has CPU fall-back when no GPU is available.
- CUDArray relies on cuBLAS, cuRAND and cuDNN for fast array operations.
- deeppy has a pythonic user interface (that is, no YAML configuration files).
- In terms of speed, CUDArray/deeppy is very competitive with other popular neural network frameworks. At least, that's my experience so far.

There are about 300 different variables I'm using based on n-grams of varying sizes, each of which can have a non-negative integer value.  There are 5 different classes I am trying to sort points into, with prior probabilities of 0.08 to 0.5.  (If there are any more questions needed about the dataset to answer the following questions, let me know.)

However, when I run the algorithm, it will shrink some of the smaller groups down to a small number (much smaller than what one would expect based on the standard error of the prior estimates) unless I decide to weight the algorithm more heavily in favor of the labeled data for all iterations (not just the first).

Is there any basis for maintaining a higher weight for the data that is originally labeled?  Is it likely that one of the issues is the sparsity of each group's training set with respect to the number of variables?

I got a fairly good result of 85% accuracy but I felt this wasn't high enough and had an idea to just come up with my own simple formula.

My formula has a list of good keywords and bad keywords, and each keyword has a weighted number value. So if the word **movie** is on a web page it has a high number value of 5 and if a negative word appears like **medical** it has a negative number value of -5. 

All the values are added up and if it is a positive number it's a web page about movies, negative number would mean it is not related to movies. 

This may seem over simplified but I tested this on over 300,000 web pages and got a 99% accuracy rate, it basically destroyed the naive bayes on actual data. This way also uses very little memory and can process incredible fast. It seems almost too good to be true and have fears that this may not scale properly.

So I am currently a senior in college who has a job lined up in the Bay Area starting in August doing Business Analytics. I interned at the company this previous summer and most of the work involved writing SQL queries and doing visualizations in Tableau. My manager told me that if I came back I would have room to do more interesting/more complicated things than what I worked on this summer. Some more background on me is that I'm studying Statistics and Computer Science in School and am currently taking the grad level ML course offered at my college. 

Now while I am studying statistics and computer science, I feel like I still do not know enough about ML as I would like, and I would like to really practice ML in industry in the future. So my question is where do I go from here? Its too late to apply to grad school at this point as I have already signed an offer, and have never made getting into graduate school the focus of my undergraduate years. Ideally I would like to work in industry implementing ML algorithms in useful ways that have an impact for the business or the customer. I feel like I need to know more though, despite the fact that I have studied both statistics and comp sci. What would be some practical steps for me to take? I've always figured I could learn more ML on my own and participate in Kaggle competitions to build up my credentials, which would then let me transition into a more formal ML role, is that possible? I guess maybe my question boils down to do I need to at some point go to grad school? I'm not against it, but would rather learn on my own and make it that way, is that feasible?",6,2

Essentially I'm trying to code a facial ""verification"" system. Typically face recognition models use 1:N matching which means;

- We have a set of N identities
- Given image, which identity is represented in the image?

I'm trying to do a 1:1 verification system, which works like this:

- We have one identity
- Given image, does this image depict the identity?

You can see that the first system *assumes* a match occurs and tries to pin it down to the correct person, whereas the second system is checking *if* a match exists.

The difficulty is this -- ML does not work very well for this problem. Typically a classification algorithm uses training data which attempts to describe the difference between classes (e.g. this information represents THIS class, that information represents THAT class, etc), and this is analogous to the 1:N face recognition task. Face verification, on the other hand, only uses a training set with one individual class (there's no class split to discern) and attempts to ""learn"" to identify that class, but since it doesn't have contrasting information it's not very good at doing that. 

My question is this: **what kinds of techniques, if any, exist for identification instead of classification?** If I can't find any good techniques my tentative idea is to mask the 1:1 verification as a 1:N matching problem (so essentially I'll just get a bunch of random face images and collectively describe them as the ""other class""), but this requires a very large data set that I don't currently have, so I'd like to avoid that option if possible.",6,1

My approach has been to add every feature under the sun (dropout, momentum, adaptive learning, regularization, GPU, etc...).  I've been using/testing it primarily on a Kaggle competition where there is a relatively small amount of labelled data (15k).

So far things work quite well for standard training but I've never successfully trained a network using dropout.  With the latter I either get:

1 - Stuck at around 60-70% training/validation error.

2 - Numerical instabilities (NaN's)

3 - Stuck in a bias-dominated regime.

By (3) I mean the network will always select a particular output (from a softmax layer) for all validation cases.  The actual choice of output will change each epoch but the network somehow gets stuck being dominated by bias.

I've tried a whole bunch of things:

- Increase learning rate: leads either to (2) or (3).  this happens already at smallish rates like 0.5.
- Reclu or channelout layers: problem happens for both
- Momentum: usually makes things worse
- Fan-in regulator: makes some weights vanishingly small (1e-100) and tends to lead to bias domination (but avoids numerical instabilities)
- L2 regulator: doesn't do too much.
- Adaptive per-weights learning rate: tends to lead to more numerical instabilities.  this really speeds up normal learning but with dropout it seems to exacerbate (2) and (3).
- Random amount of dropout: between e.g. 0.3-0.5 still gives all the same problems.

I realize that the best thing to do would probably be to retreat to a more standard dataset like MNIST (which I will probably do) but the thing is that without dropout I can acheive 80% accuracy on the validation set (and 100% on the training set) so its clear that there's enough data to do better.

To give more details I'm using a relatively large network (4-5 layers of size 200 with inputs of size ~50 and output ~10) using either Reclu or channelout and without any pretraining.  

I refresh the choice of dropout units every minibatch (size 10-150) and I also do 0.2 dropout on the input layer.

I do intend to go back to MNIST and compare to some published results but if anyone can provide some thoughts or inspirations I would really appreciate it!

IMO you can't simply automate completely a data scientist's job but for a company that's considering hiring a smaller team, it might reduce the size with a pair or two.

I'm pretty sure it has a couple of hidden and clever solutions but overall it seems that it 'just' utilizes the basic models and statistical analyses that most of us already know. 

The other thing I'm nto sure is whether it requires some kind of preconfiguration or you just let it run in the wild? IMO certain business areas have the typical patterns (accounting, manufacture, etc) that they're prepared for and they tailor the system for the specific database of the customer as the system itself is very flexible. Under the hood it has to have some kind of knowledge that it's dealing with products and product categories and not employees and their evaluation data.

We can detect that the phone is in motion with GPS at the phone or radio strength information at the switching center that the towers connect to.  The problem is, someone can be riding in a car and they still need to be able to text.

  One difference between the scenario of a driver texting vs a passenger texting is that the driver is likely not typing as they normally do while not driving.  In particular the timing information between keystrokes could be used to detect one-handed typing which is characteristic of texting while driving.  The phone screen could then be made to go blank until the phone's GPS shows that it has stopped. ",9,0

[7, 3, 86, 44, 322]

I'm trying to find a metric that will allow me to see which users have the closest preferences to the focus user.   Because the goal of the analysis is to find the most favored preferences, ideally there should be a weighting toward the top.  i.e. if the test user most prefers item 3, then that scores more highly than if the test user also prefers item 322 in position 5.  

Ideally too it should be fuzzy, so if a test user prefers item 3 in position 2, while the focus user prefers item 3 in position 1, this should count for something.

Simple methods of counting overlapping sets between the target and test user work for a first approximation, but these don't account for the relative rankings nor do they give additional priority to the higher ranked items.

This problem becomes worse when I have a longer list of preferences, say the top 50 items.  I really care if two users have a common top 5, but don't care so much if they have an identical ordering of their 40th-50th list--these are much less important. 

Any ideas?

I have a problem that I am looking at where there are 50 or so sensors that are recording data every minute. One of the sensors is the variable of interest (subcool, a temperature difference), 6 of the sensors relate to variables that can be changed by an operator in order to keep the variable of interest in control (steam, choke, gas rates), and the rest of the sensors monitor the environment (temperatures, pressures). The goal is to better predict and control the variable of interest. The time lag between the changing of operator controlled variables and the variable of interest can vary depending on the state of the environment. The time to action right now is usually hourly, and an out of control event could take a day or two to be brought back in control.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to attack this as a machine learning problem? What kind of preprocessing will I need to do? I have seen HMMs suggested in a few places, or the creation of time independent features using sliding time windows.
Im fairly new to this field, so any suggestions will help. Thanks!

According to him, the neurons in the deepest layers act as ""object recognizers"", corresponding to semantic classes.

One thing he showed/said particularly stood out to me, a ""human face"" filter which appeared in the deep layers, despite faces not being a class in the ImageNet labels. He said that this is because it is useful in distinguising the class ""Neck Brace"".

I wonder if this is a problem with the method of training these networks, and the ImageNet dataset in particular: the annotations are ambigous and often arguably incorrect, so the networks may be learning concepts which are only associated with the labels by statistical correlations of this particular dataset, and might generalize poorly to real world images.

I'm sure that the big companies have developed better annotation methods and training sets, but academic efforts still seemed focused on this benchmark. Has progress reached a point where this may be counterproductive.",1,1

There were several problems with the example being outdated, such as their use f the print function without the parends.  I have fixed that.

For some reason, in the example the code:

By ""granularity"" I mean level of the data.

So, the prediction you want to make is at the email level, but you have data at the word granularity for email.  So, at the email level, do you view each possible word as a categorical variable that takes on {0,1} if its present in a given email? So, say you wanted to take a shot at modeling with logistic regression, does this leave with like 100,000 coded variables (if your dictionary has 100,000 words) for each email?  


How does this model stay tractable? Especially if the email level data is significant?  Would that data get overshadowed by fitting 100,000 dummy variables?

I guess companies like Amazon or Netflix use the machine learning techniques in order to recommend new movies/products the user is likely to be interested etc.

The web part would be pretty straightforward like.. when a user buys a product, the database will be modified such that e.g. the corresponding User object now has an entry to the corresponding Product object etc. 

We'd have thousands and millions of data like this and we'd be able to predict what the user would like to buy and display in the Recommended section on the web using some machine learning techniques. 

So exactly how is this done? We'd have separate servers dedicated in periodically running the algorithms that pull off this immense data from database, compute, and modify each of the corresponding User object so that it now contains the new computed data for its Recommended field?

So since a letter or number symbol is 2 dimensional, does that mean that you would use 2 layers or dimensions?

I read about [stream reasoning](http://streamreasoning.org/), which I find quite interesting. It seems to be a really young field in science.

Basically, you have a knowledge base and try to reason, derive new knowledge, on a stream of incoming events. Therefore, complex events are derived from simpler events by means of deductive rules.

One engine for example is [ETALIS](https://code.google.com/p/etalis/), which seems to be quite famous.

Has anybody of you used stream reasoning before? Could this be used to predict some events?

Has anyone achieved real world gains using Independent Component Analysis or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization? Are they worth the extra computation required.

I'm trying to find a link/reference to an article showing the results of an unsupervised computer vision effort. 

Amongst the description of the project was a large 6000x6000 image of tons of thumbnails where the similar thumbnails were placed next to each other. The image flowed from cars-&gt;boats -&gt; canoes -&gt; camping -&gt; trees-&gt;flowers-&gt;bugs on flowers and so on.

It 'might' have been done by google.

Thanks for the help.",4,0

I know and understand (more or less) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and I would like to stack some layers to do deep belief networks. But my training samples aren't binary values but continuous values, and (if I'm not totally lost) the original formulation of RBM is for discrete samples values.

I've seen some RBM algorithms to work with continuous values but were quite old (http://pdf.aminer.org/000/271/523/a_continuous_restricted_boltzmann_machine_with_a_hardware_amenable_learning.pdf). Is there any ""standarized"" and ""modern"" (and simple if possible but probably that's asking too much) way to learn layer by layer with unsupervised algorithm from continuous information?

Thank you.",3,0

I've a 3rd year com. eng student going to my 4th next year. I have been sort of focusing/specializing in the computer vision area and signal processing area and am familiar with some of the mathematics and software libraries available for these areas. 

One think I'd like to do this December holidays is to get into ML. But looking at this subreddit, it looks like there are countless things to look at! Looking at the openCV ML Libraries is also rather limiting to just knowing how to apply these. Can I know a good course/book/roadmap to getting into this field?",19,16

I am looking for suggestions how to store ~10 million images. Each image has different size and has heterogenous information attached (basically a dozen key value pairs). They are rather small rarely more than 100kb.

These images will go through some transformation pipeline which will end with Convolutional Neural Network.

I was thinking about mongodb since the image meta data will be natively kept as documents and image as binary data fields.",16,7
