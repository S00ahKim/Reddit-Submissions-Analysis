Well, apparently a very good talk is not enough to reach a suitable implementation...

I have the following spectral clustering toy example:
http://www.sendspace.com/file/m545dl
(Apologies for the lousy website, it's the only one I could find)

My understanding is that after calculating P, the separation between the points should be found using the second eigenvector. However, the separation is in the forth eigenvector... Any redditors out there happen to understand what I'm doing wrong?",7,6
9,2010-6-8,2010,6,8,11,cck42,Ask ML: Complete newb here - help me understand the barriers of basic brain architecture simulation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cck42/ask_ml_complete_newb_here_help_me_understand_the/,[deleted],1275962970,"So I've read through On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins twice now (http://www.onintelligence.org/) and I have to say his proposed architecture on how the brain works seems somewhat trivial to accomplish in a language like C++.

First, my background. I did well in a couple of c++/java courses in college, but that was a few years back. It would take a bit of a refresher to do simple file i/o.

From what I can gather in Mr. Hawkins' book, however, it seems that it would be relatively simple to create an ""object"" that can pass on information to a higher level object. After a period of time, it can begin to recognize patterns (hmm, how it would recognize patterns would not be so trivial I imagine), and pass on those patterns to the higher level object. Then based on prediction of when those patterns occur, it could fire its response to the higher object before the pattern even finishes. Of course there would have to be a feedback channel, sending information ""down"" back to the beginning.

So I guess my question is, as someone with next to no AI experience, what are the barriers here? The basic structure of the brain (going only a few levels deep) seems somewhat ""easy"" to accomplish.

My apologies for my deep-seeded ignorance. :) Just a curious mind, I guess.

EDIT: Wow, thank you everyone for the awesome responses. I love a good discussion!",50,13
