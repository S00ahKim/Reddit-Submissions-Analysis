have with a dataset of 150000+ song lyrics?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9qysk/im_a_beginning_machine_learner_what_fun_can_i/,lars_,1254748593,"I'm starting a MsC in machine learning this christmas. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/9q28l/simple_simhashing_my_favorite_trick/) described a simple clustering algorithm. It inspired me to implement it, using n-character substrings from the song lyrics as features to learn from. (I now understand that when the post said n-gram, it probably meant n _words_, not characters. Will try this too). 

I figure it would be fun to see if one could make a kind of recommendation engine for artists based on their lyrics alone. What else can I do with this data? Are there any other useful features I can pull out of the data? (If you think I really should be using a better algorithm, I'd like to know also!)

The results I've got so far have been somewhat useful, though my algorithm does for example think The Beatles are similar to N.W.A. ",24,29

I'm also not restricting how these classes might be related, so one might be a subset of the other, etc.

I'm wonder if there's a known general result here. My instinct would be to pick the distribution among the two classes which gives the lowest entropy prediction of the distribution of the labels, but that contradicts my intuition in a lot of ways for some cases.

The problem restated.
You have many labels, and you know their distribution for items in set A. You also know their distribution for items in set B. You want to predict the label of an item in both sets, without making any more assumptions. Can you do it? Is there a general way to pick one distribution over the other?",7,2

I'm a computer science student taking a course on algorithms. We are close to finishing covering the book we are using, Introduction to Analysis and Design of Algorithms by Anany Levitin. Since we have the class until December, the professor is currently open to suggestions of algorithms we would like him to discuss in class. I would love to seize this opportunity to learn of algorithms used in the AI and Machine Learning fields.

For example, I remember that in the Super Mario Bros. AI competition, the A* algorithm was used by almost everyone. It'd be interesting to discuss it and see why it was used.

Soooo, if some of you could suggest interesting algorithms and a brief example on where it's used, I would highly appreciate it.

Thank you!",28,21

I am currently in my last quarter of undergrad at a 2nd-tier UC doing computer science, and am interested in machine learning. I've taken a couple grad-level Machine Learning classes and have been having a lot of fun with my homework and projects. I also have several years' experience working as a software engineer and am currently working (nearly) full-time.

Since I am supporting my fiancee who is also in school right now (and will be for a while), I don't think grad school is an immediate option for me without taking on enormous amounts of debt. Does anyone know of an employer who will consider someone without an advanced degree for a position doing data mining / machine learning? Any tips on getting into the specialty with only a BS in CS?

Ultimately, I would like to be doing work creating/adapting algorithms to solve interesting problems (recommendation engines, advertising optimization, IR, NLP, etc), but wouldn't mind maintaining/enhancing existing systems at first to get my feet wet if needed.

Edit: Thanks for the interesting and insightful comments everyone!

What I'm going to do is find work doing some type of ML ASAP (or at least in proximity to the guys doing it) and then figure out how to afford to get a Master's once I have a little bit more experience applying the stuff. BTW, I got some anonymous comments that there are companies out there that are not too hung up on the piece of paper... so I guess it's like the rest of the industry: if you're good at it, someone will hire you to do it!",13,22
