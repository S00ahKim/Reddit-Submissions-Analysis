For a small project I'd like to sift through a large amount of articles and tag them according to category (Interview, News article etc.) and occurrence of a preset of notable items ( Names, Brands ).

Later on I might want to add some language processing ( figure out if the article is FROM, WITH or ABOUT an item ) or sentiment analysis ( is this article positive or negative in tone ).

I've googled around, and I'm torn between GATE, NTLK and Rapidminer. I also have a couple of questions:

* I couldn't find an Open Source library or Suite  written in C or C++. Why is that? I'd think that it is quite resource hogging and using Java (which seems to be preferred ) or any other interpreter language would unneccesarilly bog down performance.
* I'm not sure if any of the three tools above are really suited for the job. Especially GATE and Rapidminer seem like a bit of overkill. Your thoughts on that?
*What are some good books/tutorials that will help me with this project? I've already bookmarked [this](http://www.puffinwarellc.com/index.php/news-and-articles/articles/33.html?showall=1) link which at the time of posting is on the top of this subreddit. It seems to be quite useful for my goal. Other than that I am lost as for example the NTLK examples use tags like NN, NP-BSJ which I guess are shorthand for some grammatical definition (Nominative Noun maybe?) but which don't really help understanding. Any recommendations?

The hobby depends on several large paper catalogs issued to help collectors identify what they have.

Could you please confirm or correct my thoughts, and/or fill in any gaps missing?

So, basically the structured perceptron is a variant of the multiclass perceptron, except for how you implement collecting the best score. A first-order Markov assumption is made, saying that the current sequence index only depends on the previous index. The input is an entire sequence of words, instead of just one word as would be in a non-structured case, as well as a vector of all possible labels (y). The function f(x,y) returns a guessed label sequence for the given word sequence.

In a multiclass perceptron, getting the best score is easily done through iteration since we only deal with classifying one label to one instance. The problem with classifying entire sequences is that it results in an exponential growth of the number of possible labelings. This is where the Viterbi algorithm is needed, which recursively finds the best path using two feature sets; one for determining how likely a given POS tag is to a certain word, and one for determining how likely a certain POS tag is coming directly after another POS tag. The score from each of these feature sets are multiplied with a unique weight for each state. If the chosen path is wrong, each weight in the states of the wrong path are punished, and the weights in the correct path are awarded.

This is about how far I have (hopefully) understood. My biggest questions right now is how the features are structured (is the previous tag sequence a part of the features?), and how to actually implement the Viterbi algorithm. Also, is there an implementation of a POS tagger using structured perceptron anywhere I could analyze (preferably in Java)?

I would be very grateful if you could give me some hints or resources to look into!",3,8

Here is an interesting problem I have been thinking about - find a similarity metric over subreddits. E.g., from my subscribed subs, /r/bicycling and /r/motorcycles are closer to each other than either is to /r/machinelearning, which, in turn, is close to /r/maths and /r/programming.

So, the problem is to find a way to scan the content in the subs (possibly only post titles and maybe text of self posts) and come up with a model that posits a distance.

This seems like an unsupervised learning problem to me, possibly using something like a bag of words model. But I suppose the models can trained in a supervised manner as well, since most subreddits have a section for related subs in the sidebar. I'm hoping if people more experienced than myself can think of promising models to apply on this problem?

Applications would be many - automatically recommending subreddits for a new post, suggesting related reddits to users and so on.

btw, I'm not planning to build it or anything right now, since I haven't really looked into which models would be best to use. Just a thought experiment for now.

Here's how it works:

* Subsequent document queries will have their topic distribution inferred and matched for similarity via Random Projections and Levenshtein distance

The details:

My sample data is from a 12-96 dimension space, have about 1000-100000 samples at every run. The data is not well separated, but outliers can occur.

I use the following initialization:
I run the k-means N times on different subsamples, and cluster my k*N results with single linkage. I use the means of these clusters as my initial seed. (N is about 10, and the subsamples are the size of my original samples divided by N. I use different subset every time.)

If there is no model, than doing NP apparently corresponds to a something like a brute force search trying all combinations of the parameters (which implies imposing some discretization on continuous ones) and the finding the best best pD for each pFA.  This, in my mind, raises two questions

1) Given some finite data set it may very well be that there may be pFA which are unique though many may be very close.  I imagine that this is handled by binning (e.g. all pFAs rounded to the nearest 0.05 - like a histogram)
Right?

2) Can NP overfit?  I know it's optimal for the exact underlying densities but how does sampling affect that?   If what I wrote above is correct, than the number of combinations of parameters can be ungodly (10 levels of 10 parameters ==&gt; 10^10).  It's not doing a fitting in the standard machine learning paradigm sense but I would think that as the parameter discretization increases the finer mesh will yield a higher fractional error per bin(like shot noise).
In any event, I have no idea how to compare this to a standard classifier (be it boosted trees, svm, etc)",0,1

I need your comments on the [MASH
project](http://www.mash-project.eu/) we have been working on over the
last few years.

The core idea behind it is to allow contributors to write image
feature extractors (edges, color, etc.), that will be automatically
combined with machine learning methods we have developed, to get high
performance image-based prediction system. By combining algorithms
developed by people with very different backgrounds, we hope to
achieve performance higher than the state-of-the-art.

The [Factory](http://www.mash-project.eu/factory/) is the most recent
incarnation of this idea. It allows you to write image features in C++
and test them on-line. Performance is assessed on mimicking tasks: We
train a virtual robot to mimic the choice of actions of a teacher, to
reach a red flag in a 3d environment. Hence, your image features will
be combined by our machine learning methods to predict what do to
(""turn left"", ""turn right"", or ""go forward""), given what the
robot sees, and has seen since the beginning of the current test.

The motivation is to show that current correlations we have do indeed have structure, as opposed to chance.  However, it is difficult to show what structure there should be by chance.

We could shuffle the correlations in the matrix: this ensures the sum of the elements remains the same.  However, doing this is computationally unfeasible---millions of shuffles proves not to find valid correlation matrices (positive definite).  Also, this by nature will not yield all possible correlation matrices that sum up to the same value.  For example, -1, 1, and 1 sum to 1 (as will 1, -1, and 1), but you could also have -.5, 1, .5 sum up to 1.  

Other methods for generating covariance matrices include the Wishart distribution and factor analysis methods.  However, these will not fix the sum of the elements, and it's not entirely clear how these methods compare with the true distribution of correlation matrices.

1. 11 classes
2. 4 classes

We are in the design phase and I've been asked to estimate the required sample size for the experiment. i.e. how many text reports do we need to extract, label, train and test the classifiers to meet a desired target performance (e.g. AUC 0.80).

Sample size estimation is commonly performed in designing health and medical experiments. Researchers want to know how many participants they need to recruit before conducting the experiment to determine its feasibility. i.e. it might be too expensive or difficult. 

From my understanding, sample size estimation are used for hypothesis testing. i.e. to ensure there is enough data to look for differences between control and experiment groups based on a specified statistical power, effect size and other factors. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination#Required_sample_sizes_for_hypothesis_tests for some examples.

There are two main reasons why I have been asked to provide a sample size estimate:

1. Minimise costs: we need to pay domain experts to label reports so we don't want to label more data than is needed.

2. Classifier confidence: The rarest class in the 4-class experiment comprises of 0.5% of the reports. If a small sample size is used and the classifier is only tested against  lets say 2 instances of the rare class then can we really be confident of the classifier's performance on this class?

I came across a 2012 paper in Medical Informatics: Figueroa et al. ""Predicting sample size required for classification performance"" - http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/12/8 which proposed to:

1. Build the learning curve on a small amount of labelled data
2. Build a regression model (non linear, inverse power law) of the learning curve
3. Use the model to predict how many samples are needed to achieve target performance

I'm not sure if this is the way to go so I wanted some feedback. I come from a computing background (not Health / Medicine) and have NOT performed sample size estimation in my machine learning work so far. 

Many thanks!

I graduated with a bachelors in electrical engineering in December of 2011.  I took an intro to neural networks course while in school.  Since then, I've been very interested in the topic and have done a lot of what I would call brainstorming.

I have been clinging to the idea that I can apply neural networks to predicting financial markets and make a fortune.  I am sure that many others have had the same idea, and many have probably been disappointed.  However, I cannot shake the idea.

My basic idea is to train a neural net with as much data as I can gather.  Even potentially unrelated data like average temperature in the US, number of international airline flights, moon phases...  I'll use historical data for training, and a small subset of it will be reserved for testing.

If the net seems to be accurate, I would consider throwing some money into the market.  Really, though, my dream is to make millions by either managing other people's money or selling my services to some kind of hedge fund or other financial institution.  Trust me, I know that the odds are stacked heavily against me.  Just being honest about the hopes that are driving this.

I have spent maybe 30 hours actually writing code for my project, all in my spare time, outside of my full time working hours.  So far, I have succeeded in doing the following.

 - Programming a basic multilayer neural network class
 - Writing a script which downloaded all available historical data for every security listed on the NYSE, from yahoo finance
 - Writing a java class for generating some basic technical indicators

I have a basic understanding of neural networks and I have actually programmed a few which did something useful, including one which classified handwritten numerical digits.  However, I know there is so much more that I could learn in the field of machine learning.

I guess my questions are:

1.  Is this even worth my time?  It's an interesting hobby but I would be disappointed if it never proved useful.

2.  Would I be better off getting a stronger background in machine learning before even attempting this?

3.  I am starved for good resources.  Everything is either way over my head, or way too basic.

4.  Has anyone ever been independently successful at this type of thing?

Any other advice is also welcome.  Thanks for reading.  I really appreciate any help.

Say I'm trying to model something that has N states (in my case, N=27). The system is typically at a different state in each time step but it's not clear what the relationships are.

How would I be able to detect common patterns in this sequence? I'd like to be able to do this in a 'fuzzy' way, so that very similar sequences count toward  the same pattern. 

Any ideas?

PS. I'm not a machine-learning guy",19,12

Though I can't find a good dataset with annotated data. I'm looking for more than just data annotated with positive and negative. I'm looking for a dataset with several emotions. This could be or discrete values (ekman 6 basic emotions) or continues values (arousal-valence model). Does anyone know where I can get such a dataset ?",0,1

I have this little college project for my AI class, and i don't have the time to study AI deep and intense, and i want, like a shortcut.

My homework is like: Create a neural network which learns something and then recognize it.

Please, guide me to some steps ( tutorials, chapters from various books etc ) so i can do this homework.

As i said, time is precious. Thanks",15,0

I've read a bit about ML and want to take a class in it. I am planning to take Intro to AI and ML together next semester. My friend said thats a bad idea to take ML before finishing Intro to AI. I really want to take both. What do you think I should do? I have a sound knowledge of all the basic data structures and algorithms including the popular graph algorithms. I have also already taken Linear Algebra and Applied Combinatorics. I haven't taken a Stats class yet.,13,4
