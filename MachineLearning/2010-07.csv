I've built a HMM for my work and am now looking at the output the model is giving me. The problem is that my B-W calibrated HMM doesn't seem to have great discriminating power; what I expect to see is the calibrated observation distribution in each state to be peaked at different symbols, so that I can identify symbols by states. If I use a short observation sequence for the calibration, I do see this behaviour; when I use a long sequence, however, I get very similar distributions in each state.

For reference, my model has 3 hidden states, there are 20 possible observation symbols. When I say 'short sequence', I mean about 50-80 symbols; when I say 'long sequence', I mean more like 2500.

1. Is there a heuristic for setting up the initial distributions (initialisation, transition, observation)?

2. Training with very long observation sequences (eg, 2500 observations) seems to make all the observation sequences converge to some (steady-state?) distribution. Am I correct in viewing this as an indication that the model isn't expressive enough (ie, doesn't have enough states) to describe the sequence effectively? I tried this with a larger model (100 hidden states), but I think I'm not initializing the distributions in a good way (see question 1!).

Help much appreciated!
