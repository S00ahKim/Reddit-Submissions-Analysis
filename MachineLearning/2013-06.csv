And I had a few questions:

1. Most implemented packages for isomap that I found (in R) simply mapped all my data to the manifold they ""found"". Is there a way to get the map itself (function mapping from input space to the manifold)? So that I would be able to learn the manifold on the training set and apply it to test sets?

2. What are the newer/better methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction?

3. How does non-linear reduction perform for small sample sizes (p &gt;&gt; n)?

Thanks a lot,

However, when reading papers around any example application / implementation I always find that they describe some network structure (how many hidden layers to use, size of hidden layers, distributions, connectivity, pooling, etc) and I rarely end up with a clear idea of why this network structure was chosen.  I'm wondering if anyone can give me a basic rundown on the thought process that goes on behind choosing network structure.  

Why do different models end up being chosen with a certain number of layers / node count?  
In convolutional + pooling setups, how do people decide on block sizes/activation regions?  
Is there some idea of what general function each layer should perform going in?  
Is the primary driver of these choices theory based or is it more driven by tinkering and seeing what tends to work?

I've had the fortunate opportunity to work with a professor these past few months in a lab. I really enjoy the work I'm doing, and have been seriously considering going to grad school for machine learning. I wanted to know if any Ph. D and non-Ph. D students could chime in about the work they're doing, whether they're in industry or academia,  etc. I'm interested in hearing the difference between pursuing a Ph. D and not pursuing one if I eventually want to work in a career in CS doing machine learning stuff. So far the stuff I got to work on is in information retrieval, but in the future I'm also interested in other applications such as robotics/computer vision, NLP, etc. 

Lastly, beyond math, statistics, cs classes, and coding/practicing extensively in all of them, what can I eventually do to become very good at ML?

The language confers many advantages over C/C++/Matlab/R/Python/Java.

My past usage of linear algebra is singularly focused around ML and signal processing.

The layout so far is to implement Numpy style ndarrays, i.e. a tensor represented internally by a vector and shape info. The language I'm working in doesn't support polyargs/default args but I've come up with solns around it. This approach is preferable to Matlab in that I can avoid tricky index arithmetic by defining operations over axes. This is approach is primitive when compared to R in that named features and observations ids aren't native.

Juggling an index vector is PITA, but it's assumptive of me to expect that all work uses these. It'd be a bad use of resources to bake them in at that level. I'm trying to design it with the ability to easily wrap label info but not mandate it.

Multiplication/Division is Hadamard.

Indices can accept boolean ndarrays and negative values.

I've considered doing linear algebra on abstract types, then compiling them by filtering over lapack driver rearrangement, subject to Oh time regression on input size and matrix features(triangular, diagonal, et al) to optimize performance but this introduces API headaches and having an ""active library,"", i.e. one that makes decisions based on ./configure. This feature should be middleware to lapack.

Anyway, at the core of a linear algebra interface what would you like to see? The language doesn't support infixed operations easily. So scratching that, what nifty linear algebra interfaces would make your specific work easier.",7,9

For example, if I was looking at a dataset that had just height and weight, I might be able to multiply height and weight and then see if the data has a ""cutoff point"" and use that to predict whether something will have that trait.


But if I had height, weight, age, gender, ethnicity, and like 5 other attributes, I wouldn't know what to do.  Especially if I know for sure that some attributes contribute more heavily to the determination of the trait I'm looking for.

I.e. a human recognises a digit by the known topology of the digit rather than thinking in terms of pixels. Is there any research in this sort of digit recognition?

I guess neural networks do something similar, but they are restricted to a known input dimensionality. Maybe one could use resizing algorithms, PCA, etc. and a neural network to achieve what I mean. But perhaps there are other ways.",17,6

Unfortunately the journal in question is behind a paywall so it's difficult to distribute, however I can provide an alternative (free) paper that deals with essentially the same equation.

The part I'm having trouble understanding is: (P{t+1} - P{t}) How is P{t+1} calculated exactly? My assumption is that P{t} is the output of the state at the current time (i.e. before the action is taken) and P{t+1} is the output of what the next time-step would be if the weights were to stay the same (i.e. the action is taken, then the resulting state is fed as the input to the network and P{t+1} is the resulting output) Is my assumption correct?

I've read both Journals (the actual journal I'm talking about is: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2298811 and the formulas are (5) and (6) in case some of you have access to journals through academic facilities etc.) and I've read through the TD (and several other) sections in: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html however it seems none of them actually explain how the prediction for {t+1} is calculated (and I assume it's probably common knowledge among RL circles hence their not explaining it).

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and if this is in the wrong sub I am deeply sorry. I don't visit this sub often.

I'm trying to implement a two step process for improving the landform classification accuracy of a terrestrial surface. 

The first step has already been done. It consisted of going through the pixel data set, extracting features for each of the pixels, running them through a segmentation algorithm, extracting more features for the segments, running the segments through a classifier.

This is ground truth: http://d.pr/i/ilVj

This is end of step 1: http://d.pr/i/fd9I

For the second step, we want to compute the geometric properties for each segment (aided by our own previous classifications done in step 1) and add that to the feature vectors of each segment for a second classification phase. This second step would aim to reclassify segments that were misclassified in step 1 correctly. 

I'm not exactly sure how to do this. There are some 5000 segments in that image. The segments have little to no geometrical significance in relation to the landform they make up. Each one of those landforms could be made up by hundreds of segments. A segment classified as crater wall could look exactly the same as a segment classified as concave ridge. I don't know what meaningful properties could geometrically characterize the segment and distinguish it from different classes. To me, as of now, extracting geometrical properties for each segment would be meaningless.

I need to find a way to make extracting geometric properties of each segment work. I'm not sure if this is even the path I should be taking, considering I'm not sure how it would help. Another option, like I mentioned above, would be to find features that describe the segment in relation to the landform it has been classified as and more importantly in relation to the huge landform it makes up. So basically, features that describe the spatial background context of the segment. (IE, the classes of the segments around it or something of that nature)

Essentially, I need descriptors or features that would trigger the classifier in the second pass to reclasssify the segment from what it originally was to what it now (because of the new feature vector) thinks it is. 

Thanks for all the help. I can clarify anything in the comments section. ",0,1

From what I understand, choosing the number of topics is up to us (but i would also love to know about the best approach in choosing the # of topics in relation to the # of documents. do we assign 1 topic per document?). But lets say I have two documents where stopwords have been emitted, and I have two topics. 

I know we just randomly distribute words initially, so would I do something as simple as assigning every other word in both documents to Topic 1 and Topic 2, and then start the improvement process from there?
