I am kinda new to this field so this might be a really stupid question. But the thing is that I have thought really hard about this and haven't found any mention of it anywhere. 

Given a mean and variance how do you generate data points from that univariate gaussian? And given a mean vector and covariance matrix how do you generate points from a multivariate gaussian?",11,7

But when PCA is interpreted as a latent variable model I have trouble interpreting the differences between the two in these terms. The only difference between the two is that in Probabilistic PCA noise is overall noise. While in factor analysis noise is considered for each of the factors.

Both are latent variable models, so both could be interpreted as decoding hidden factors. So where do the differences come from? Like one explains the variance the other covariance. One is rotation invariant the other isn't... etc.",3,7

I'm working on an article-score prediction machine learning project. So far, I've written a ruby API for reddit (which I will release as a gem at a later time), some code to take samples of articles in ten one-minute intervals and then another measure of score taken hours later (this will be my class variable). I also have Flesch (syllables) and Fog (word complexity) readability measures as string attributes coming in from the [Lingua::EN::Readability](http://www.pressure.to/ruby/) project.

I will be running various experiments using Weka on the resulting .arff files. Before I begin translating my collected data to .arff, I'm wondering if there are some other attributes or relations I might want to include as features. For example, time-velocity of surrounding articles (how many articles/minute are being submitted), submitting user comment/sub karma, score of top (or bottom?) comment posted at the last data point, score changes between time steps (or would any useful relationship be found by my decision trees / multi-layer perceptron networks?).

Thanks for any advice.",6,7
