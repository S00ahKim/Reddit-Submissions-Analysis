While trying to convince the other that our favorite group was the best she said ""They have pretty voices but taeyeon is racist, do you really want to support them?"".

I was torn, because i love the group. But from that point on everytime i heard her voice that was all i could think of. 

I dont know, am i just being oversensitive? Or should i just say whatever and act like it never happened?  

Yes i googled and her comment was very insensitive, and its hard to support people who say these things. ",19,0

Fine, everyone has their own taste in music, and I'll be the first to admit that I like a few artists that would raise some eyebrows.  

But can anyone here educate me on what it is about SNSD that creates an almost cult like following?  I think most will admit that their music isn't revolutionary, the choreography isn't groundbreaking, the vocal talent is average to above average (a smattering of talent with a lot of meh in between), and yes, the ladies are attractive and there are nine of them, but its not like they're all drop-dead gorgeous.  To make matters worse, growing up in the States, I can't help but feel incredibly uncomfortable when a bunch of 20+ yr old women act ""cute"" in that way SNSD does.

I've been listening to SNSD for a little while now to give them a chance, and I'll admit one thing: their songs are catchy and its impossible to get them out of my head.  

Can anybody here explain their fandom?  Should I stick it out and keep on listening, or is it really a YMMV kind of group?

So until this post is ~~an hour old~~ until I feel like it, I'll be making custom flairs for the people who want them or for those that are too 'socially awkward penguin' to message the mods for one :P It can be anything SNSD related (songs, lyrics, jokes, names, etc), it's all good as long as it's not offensive. Make sure to tell me the color you want as well!

Here is the new rule:
- - -
Inapropriate comments/usernames will not be tolerated.

(This rule is subject to change. We will post any changes.)

Usernames like ""I_Fap_To_SNSD"" are unacceptable.

EDIT: Users will not be banned unless they are long time offenders. (multiple inappropriate comments)
We would rather that the readers of r/SNSD downvote these comments and report them to us so we can remove them.

*This subreddit is not here to provide you sexual pleasure. There are things on the internet called ""porn"", you know.

*We don't want to discourage contributing readers to leave because of this rule. It is only to keep out offenders who post nothing but inappropriate  things. 

*We are calling on all users to report innappropriate comments and downvote them until us mods can take action against them. Please message us about usernames you find innapropriate/offensive. Thank you to the users who have sent us messages about this issue.

We are encouraging users to send us a message if you have any questions.

If you are interested in doing this then please leave a comment with your League username. If I find that enough people are interested then this team will most likely happen.

Although it isn't necessary, having a microphone/headset would be great. It just makes it a lot easier to communicate and whatnot. Thanks for taking the time to look at this and I hope to be playing with you guys soon!:D

I don't know if it's a mistake or not, but it becomes painfully obvious that you're trolling around when [multiple comments receive a report](http://i.imgur.com/PJfWA.jpg), all coming from the same thread. If you're trying to prove a point, say something, don't be a douche about it. Also I'm sure you guys have noticed that comments are getting downvoted for no reason (even more so by Reddit standards), making it obvious that we have some trolls lurking around here. I've noticed it for awhile but this was just laughably obvious. [I wish I knew who did this.](http://i.imgur.com/xVwbZ.gif)

Also, to those who downvote people with different opinions, please remember ['Reddiquette'](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). If you disagree, either reply or ignore it but don't downvote someone's opinion, especially if they're mature and articulate about it. That's probably a lot to ask since we are on Reddit, but it's worth pointing out.",19,42

As said in the title i've been collecting a ton of fancams over the past year or so and i've come to a point where most newly added fancams are from new / recent performances. In short I've pretty much seen ""everything"" there's out there. (~~161~~ 179 videos added in total.)

***Note:*** These are fancams of performances in high quality. I've not added ones that does not focus on a single member nor have I Just ""added to add"" all of these are handpicked.

Even with that said above, i'd like to see if you guys could perhaps share a few fancams of your own! I'm really displeased by the amount of Sooyoung and Hyoyeon fancams but that's just how it is I guess. I'll regulary be updating this channel (as much as Soshi allows me, heh) so i'm open to anything.

**Edit:** Fancams are sorted by date for each member. (top newest, lowest oldest) This is the date of the uploader and not necessarily the date of the performance; it should be pretty accurate but re-uploads does / has happen(ed).

***Update:*** Been brushing up on a couple of things and added 18 more fancams since I made this post.

The recent fancams are now buried within the indivudual members playlist due to how it is arranged. You can access the newly added fancams through my favoirte list which you can find under ""videos"". (Incase you've already been through them all and aren't quite sure which ones where just added).

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (Downvotes will not be counted)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Tiffany** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.

----

###***Special Event:***

* Since it's the girls' anniversary, I wanted to have a little contest on the side. A shout out to the graphic designers (or to anyone who wants to participate :P), you guys can create either a **banner** or a **side pic** for the subreddit!
* The same rules apply for this portion of the 'contest', but with one small change, only one sidebar and banner picture will be chosen for their anniversary (the anniversary banner and sidebar picture with the most upvotes will be chosen).
* If you're submitting one of each, post them in separate posts.
* For the banner, the dimensions must be at least 1366 x 150, but no more than 2000 x 150, this is to ensure that it fits the majority of our users' screens (sorry to the 1024's, 1366's are just more common :C). It **must** be in a PNG format! JPGs will be scoffed at!
* It has to be all 9 girls and remember to adjust to the screen, mainly make sure that the 9 girls are at least visible for 1366 x 768 monitors.
* Please remember to adjust for the [Reddit user header](http://i.imgur.com/rLJ2J.jpg). It does overlap with the picture, so adjust accordingly.
* For the anniversary sidebar pic, the same rules apply (300 x 360, PNG and it must have all the members, etc).
* The winning banner will be used for the entire month of August, the sidebar picture will be used on the day of.
* You are allowed to add text, something like 'Happy Anniversary' or something similar to it. Don't go crazy with the text though :P
* [An example of a banner](http://i.imgur.com/Lv9FR.png).
