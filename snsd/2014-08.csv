I actually found out about it 2 days before the event and managed to get pretty awesome tickets (stage side) 1 day before. As excited as I am about this I can't help but feel weird that there were even tickets left. I know this isn't solely a snsd concert but my concern is whether this concert is not as good as the other ones hence the tickets didn't sell out? I know I got legitimate tix cus I bought at an official ticket sales place. It's my first ever snsd and kpop concert so I just wanna have the best experience possible. Also I've read other posts about popping ur snsd/kpop concert cherry but any additional advice would be awesome! :)

*edit: Also what is the difference, if any, between a concert such as this with many artists versus a purely snsd concert?",7,13

Tiffany - TTS, and maybe reality show about TTS

I plan to go to Korea next year, probably. Learning a bit Korean to find my way around and simply because I find it interesting. But when I spend so much money on a flight and stay, I'd really like to go at a time were Soshi give concerts, ideally even a fanmeeting. But what I want to make sure is where to get tickets for those things, should the time come. I never saw any links on the official Twitter and since I imagine that SNSD concerts are often sold out before you can say ""So Nyeo Shi Dae"" I want to make sure that I know beforehand which sites typically sell tickets, especially with fanmeetings, I have no clue where to look and where to go. Are there any specific sites they use or are there at least websites that post links to ticket sales really fast?

This is something that I'd really like help with though and I thought I'd start off by asking you guys about it since this issue is basically centred around my love for SNSD (and my terrible penchant for procrastination).

I haven't visited /r/SNSD in about a month and a half. Now that I'm finally back over here I was hoping that I'd be able to look through this subreddit's history and catch up on everything that I had missed. I thought that I could find it all by sorting the subreddit by ""new"" and simply going back until I reached the point that I was last at. However, it seems that there is some kind of limit to how far back I can go. I don't understand what's going on; older content obviously doesn't just disappear off reddit after a while so this is very surprising, not to mention distressing! Can anyone help me solve this problem?",9,4

Heres how it works:
 
Take a picture wearing any shirt from my [KpopGear store](http://www.kpopgear.com) and send it to me via pm on /r/snsd, email (kpopgear at gmail.com), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/kpopgear), Instagram (@kpopgear), or [Facebook.](http://www.facebook.com/kpopgear) Plenty of options, lol.
 
I will select one winner at random and send them any regular t-shirt they want from the store. All I ask in return is that I am allowed to use the pictures on the Etsy site or other social media so that I have some real life pictures of people wearing the shirts and not just mock pictures that are up on the listings. (If you would like your face cropped out of the photo for privacy reasons I am happy to do so, just let me know in your message.)
 
Selfies, group pictures, pics at the show, anything goes! Ill take pictures up until Sunday, August 17, so youll have time to get back home and send them.
 
If you have questions just let me know.
 
P.S. Thanks to the many of you who took my customer service survey last time. I gained a lot of quality information and will be making some changes to the store and adding designs based directly on the feedback of all you incredible folks. Again and again you guys proved to be so supportive and helpful, and Im forever grateful.

So I got a backstage pass and was allowed to walk from place to place. 

At around 5:30PM I'm chilling in the lounge with my friend when another pal runs to me and tells me Sunny is literally right there. I look and **HOLY SHIT**

Sunny's there in full uniform and talking with a few others. As she passes by I rise and ask her (in Korean) if I can get a picture but her manager kinda gets in the way and Sunny gives an apology. 

Then fast-forward a couple hours and I'm wandering again in the lounge and there's Sunny again, just chillin on the sofa (out of uniform) on her phone. She then proceeds to walk out and into the dressing room. She's so pretty T_T

After their performance (btw their performance was amazing!!) I run backstage and as they are exiting, I wave at Tiffany and she bowed!!! (in Korea, bowing is the common way of greeting someone in a respectful manner)

But I can't believe I forgot to ask for even an autograph.............

Anyways I will upload fancams (I apologize if they are too shaky) if anyone is interested \^^",30,48

I was nervous about meeting so many people, worried conflicts might ensue, or worse. You never know, right? 

Turns out the group from here and SSF is a group of absolutely amazing individuals. We had such a wonderful time. Everyone was so helpful to one another - sharing things, from drinks to rides to rooms to even extra tickets. Nobody was made to feel an outsider, nobody was ill-treated by anyone else. If it hadn't happened to me, I don't know if I could have believed that so many GOOD people still exist. But what came together was a beautiful and powerful thing, that resulted in lasting friendships. 

For all those who helped me organize, and all those who participated and helped each other (and me), and all those who were there in spirit - thank you for the most memorable weekend of my entire life. 

SNSD's performance was incredible and we all loved it. You've been inundated with fancams so I won't share mine since I'm screaming in all of them. xD 

I hope to see you all in 2015. Thanks for restoring my faith in people.
 

Love, Mel.

Note: For Jessica's account, there's actually an option to add her as a friend. Maybe she hasn't blocked that yet if it is a real account. ",5,4

305,2014-8-16,2014,8,16,22,2dpz4c,Theory for SNSD - TTS Comeback,StarryNight44,1408197280,"So it was announced that TTS will be making a comeback soon. Originally, it was speculated that it would be in September but SM denied these rumors. Also, the idea for a TTS reality show was being shopped around only about a month or two and now there is one being released in two weeks.

I believe that while news reports stated they were ""pitching"" the idea for a reality show, they were recording it the entire time. This brought on a theory: if there is no set date, as of late, for the new TTS album, I believe it will be released the day of the final episode airing of the TTS reality show or the day after. This way fans will get to see, most likely, preparations and footage of getting ready for the comeback and will know when exactly to buy the new album.

Since Jessica &amp; Krystal ran for 10 episodes, I'm going to assume the TTS reality show will be 10 episodes as well. So I theorize that the TTS comeback will be in October 2014.",6,12

My sister thinks it's a bit weird but she actually likes many songs (mostly from SHINee). 

My uncles and aunts just laugh but don't care. All my cousins think I'm very weird though. One even called me ""asian-washed"". But they're all very ignorant about Asia (they think China, Korea, and Japan speak the same language. Since we live in Texas with lots of Vietnamese, what Vietnamese sounds to them is basically what all of Asia speaks). 

Most of my friends don't mind and are cool about it but also find it a bit weird. I'm just glad one told me that if I ever need someone to go to an SNSD concert with, he's there. There's only 1 person in my school I know that loves Kpop but she is seriously shy so I don't talk to her much. 

There have been some people who were mean about it but I don't let it bother me. To be honest, it helps to just agree with whatever they say and they quickly shut up lol.

344,2014-8-18,2014,8,18,15,2dv618,Jessica's actual dancing ability (when she tries)/initial heavy focus as a dancer,[deleted],1408344456,"So, I've been watching some SNSD performances and stuff and found several videos that showed Jessica's full dancing skill. Of course, right now, she's known for not trying in her dances and being ""Lazy Sica"" and all, but looking back at early debut stuff, she's actually really good. There actually seemed to be a heavy focus placed upon her dancing, in the very beginning of SNSD's career. I think part of the reason might have been due to her super long trainee period, so she was one of the more accomplished dancers at the time and was therefore one of the main choices to perform the dance performances at the beginning.

[First, here's her debut teaser.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KLwXMrkNcA)

She was the only one except for Hyoyeon to have clips of her dancing instead of still shots for their debut teaser. Hyoyeon's, of course, was to be expected, since she's the main dancer of the group and the ""Dancing Queen/Machine,"" but I found Jessica's surprising when I first discovered it since she's not exactly known for her dancing. Like, at all. This is one of the things that I thought really showed how much emphasis was placed on her dancing at the time. It seems that originally, there was a pretty significant focus on Jessica's dancing, to the point that she got a dance teaser when even the dance line (minus Hyoyeon) didn't.

Then there's their early performance of ""Chaotic."" [\[Practice clip\]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqksMq34ttw) [\[Variety show performance\]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt1N9x-Vd8E)

Jessica was always at the front of the formations, leading the dance along with Hyoyeon. This is another thing that I thought showed the heavy focus on Jessica's dancing. There are a few stumbles, but she's dancing hard. Meanwhile, all the other main/lead singers (Taeyeon, Tiffany, Sunny, and Seohyun) are mostly stuck in the back.

[And their Don't Cha performance.](http://youtu.be/h9D_2iMLF7s)

Jessica was included in the dance performance while the rest of the vocal line weren't. Yoona's not even included in the dance, and she's part of the dance line and the visual. Again, just shows the amount of focus they had placed on Jessica's dancing.

They're not that many clips, but I think it shows how much of a focus on Jessica's dancing there originally was. Jessica always seems to be thought less of in regards to her dancing, but it's interesting to think that she might've originally been meant to be a lead dancer along with main singer. If nothing else, it at least shows Jessica's actual skill as a dancer, as opposed to what we usually see, since she doesn't put her full effort in dancing now.

Though I don't blame her for it since when she does try, she kinda sweats a lot and faints  (as seen in [Girls Go To School](http://youtu.be/JT93KNSYRUY?t=5m30s) and [Hello Baby](http://youtu.be/0uENYVcXmow?t=1m32s)). I don't know if she's anemic like Krystal (though it seems pretty likely), but she definitely seems to lack stamina. That, coupled with her position as a main singer, I think, are the reasons why she doesn't put as much effort and why there isn't much of a focus on her dancing anymore. Plus, you know, there's her lazy personality, but I don't think that's *completely* the reason.

Some more performances where you can see her legitimate dancing ability here:

[Do Something](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnw5vPaV-fc)

[Genie with SHINee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iT6rvGeuVA)

Anyways, I'm a new SNSD fan, so I'm not sure how well-known those dance clips are or if any of this is common knowledge or something. Most of people's opinion about Jessica's dancing are about her lack of trying rather than her lack of skill, so this probably isn't all that surprising. I found it interesting, though, especially since Jessica's my favorite member in the group, and I thought it was worth sharing.

Does anyone know of any more performances where Jessica put more than her usual effort in dancing? More recent ones?

TL;DR: Check out the videos of Jessica's dancing when she tries; she's really good. It seems there was originally a lot of focus placed on her dancing, like, lead dancer levels of focus.

On the 5th of august a special group was formed with girls that all have their own specialty by a great force. They played a big part in the invasion of the west, called 'Hallyu'. They have endured many hardships but came out stronger. Now they are the biggest girl group history has ever known and will ever know. Right now it's Girls' generation.

Let me know if you guys like it, and if any of you are singers...let me know if you use these lyrics to make an English cover! I'd love to hear it! Haha, hope you guys enjoy!


**bold**Girls' Generation ""Mr.Mr."" English Version lyrics by taengupop**bold**
Lets Go! Boy, just stop waiting around.
Let go! Show me what youre all about.
Control all of your fears and your doubts. (oh oh ooh woah~ x2)
Every single day you let your chances pass you by
Youre not even taking hints, I doubt you even try
I know you have that wild side, you bad bad bad boy you so bad

Tell me you want me now~ Mr.Mr.! (Its You) Mr.Mr. (I know that you do, do, do)
Come, let me show you how~ Mr.Mr.! (Its Me) Mr.Mr. (Im all that you need)
Every day you wait, is a chance that you dont take
Say that Im your girl, Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr.)
All I wanna do, is be right next to you
Show me that youre my Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr. x8)

Youre hot~ Youre sexy, smart &amp; supreme
Why not ask out the girl of your dreams?
One shot, but youre too shy to break free (oh oh ooh woah~ x2)
Confidence is everything, you need to step it up
Let me know youre capable and that youre tough enough
I think that you can win this girl
My mi-mi-mister, rock this world!

Tell me you want me now~ Mr.Mr.! (Its You) Mr.Mr. (I know that you do, do, do)
Come, let me show you how~ Mr.Mr.! (Its Me) Mr.Mr. (Im all that you need)
Every day you wait, is a chance that you dont take
Say that Im your girl, Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr.)
All I wanna do, is be right next to you
Show me that youre my Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr.)

1,2,3,4
(Mr.Mr., Mr.Mr.)

Get a hold of yourself (I know you can)
Get ahead of the game (make my day)
Dont be too late (Dont be too late)
Mr.Mr.! (Mister!)
Say it right to my face (Here and now)
Just be brave (Tell me Im your girl)
I know that youre shy, but thats okay! (Mister Oh~woah~)

Tell me you want me now~ Mr.Mr.! (Its You) Mr.Mr. (I know that you do, do, do)
Come, let me show you how~ Mr.Mr.! (Its Me) Mr.Mr. (Im all that you need)
Every day you wait, is a chance that you dont take
Say that Im your girl, Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr.)
All I wanna do, is be right next to you
Show me that youre my Mr.Mr. (Mr.Mr.)

I was thinking that ""The best"" would be a good album to have. i was thinking of getting the regular limited edition because i hear the photo book in that one is way better but when i went to a site to check prices it listed it as having only the dvd and the album. Was there only specific limited editions that had photo books? 

Also if you know of any where to get this album or others at a good price plz drop me a link. Thank you &lt;3 ",6,9

The printing company website Printer's Studio currently has a promotional offer going on right now until Friday the 5th of September where certain photo gifts (caps, playing cards, puzzles, posters and bags) all cost only $6 including free international shipping! :O

http://www.printerstudio.com/promotional-offers.aspx

I made a deck of Soshi playing cards with custom backs and fronts, here's a quick preview: http://i.imgur.com/TXUlnwl.png Hopefully it'll come out well, I've heard good things about their production quality, but for just $6 and a fun evening of scouring Soshi picture galleries I think it'll be worthwhile. :) 

Here's a helpful guide on the various card types: http://www.makeplayingcards.com/printed-card-types.aspx Be inventive with what you make, good luck!

**EDIT 31/08/2014:** I've just been told that the deal is only available for 300gsm smooth instead of linen or plastic, which is kind of a shame but maybe still worthwhile for 1 deck? :(",4,22
