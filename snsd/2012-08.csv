It's just a small thing, I suggest we change the banner a bit to accommodate Tiffany's preference seeing as though her mother really wanted to name her that, she (Tiffany) doesn't like the name Stephanie, and her mom seems to be a sensitive topic for her.
But don't go spending hours on a small change, I'd feel bad. 

*EDIT* It was her name """" (""Miyoung""), not Stephanie I've been reminded of that she does not like.
Thank you for the correction everyone, hahaha

By the way, the banner still looks great either way.  Good job compositor ;)",16,7

With SNSD approaching it's 5th anniversary since debut, it might be safe to say that the integrity of the group is pretty strong, but it would be naive to simply say that they will never ever disband or kick a member out because there is always that possibility.

It might seem like we know SNSD pretty well based on the shows and interviews they've done, but at times I feel like a lot of it is just a facade to maintain the money-making machine that SMent created.

Background info:
American, Male, Straight, Junior in high school, and love pretty much all k-pop music and Korean culture.. but I really like snsd, their all 9 beautiful women that can sing and I find there songs really catchy and for that I'm just attracted to them. I started learning Korean a while ago so I know most/some of what they say. I'm still a novice and will be for a while hehe.

Anyways... theirs some unfortunate reality.. if ANYONE EVER saw me listening to and or watching a k-pop music video or t.v. show.. they'd think I was either gay or a weirdo and I don't ""roll"" like that, that is IF they didn't know what it was and since it's ""foreign"" either way even if they knew they'd think I'm weird. But I know this is getting stereotypical but I guarantee you that I'm somewhat correct. I personally think that well just SUCKS! I truly would love to fully admit that I'm a die-hard fan of these things (specifically snsd) and show them off, talk about them ""sometimes"", but as a ""male"" people would for sure think theirs something up. Now say I was to listen to super junior, bigbang, and beast to name a few male groups, people would totally think I was gay (Now I have nothing against gay people but I'm not gay and I just want to listen to my own music and watch my own damn t.v. shows without being accused or harassed). Now for snsd's sake I feel like it's even worse that it's the opposite sex because guy's in America are not known to avidly listen to ""girl"" music and not only that listen to songs that are sometimes associated with love, to name one theme. Now another thing is since there also hot as hell people will then think so you only like them because they're pretty right? If I were to say yes I might just get away with it but I don't want to because that isn't the truth. I truly enjoy listening to them sing and watching them goof off same thing with other groups. Now I wouldn't know how it would go down for American girls and for that matter and other _______-American but since this is a girl group the ""punishment"" would most likely be less dramatic and most likely the same if they liked boy groups aswell. Now for Asian-Americans I'll assume that some people would understand more then just your average american that only speaks English with 0 Asian background and that they would accept your liking of this foreign wonder with more ease then someone that is expected to not know what k-pop, Korean culture is. With all that said I am a EXTREMELY die hard fan of SNSD, I listen to their music 24/7 and watch a lot of t.v. shows that they've appeared on/been apart of ect.

Now for some questions

1. Are there any other guy's with this same issue? What about for girls?

2. What do Asian-Americans, Koreans ect think of americans listeng to k-pop/snsd and watching Korean variety shows, dramas too but that's to over the top for me.

That's all the questions for now until I think of more.. but if I was too stereotypical and I need to do more ""research"" to find out that this is perfectly acceptable for American society please let me know. Some of this stuff isn't fully related to snsd but I tried my best and feel I'd get a better response from fellow sones then anyone else.

EDIT: Grammer, common sense, and removed redundant information and minor rewording. Thank you all for the support and there are some really nice posts but some I just couldn't respond to because they're perfect answers that left me speechless..",46,24

It has become apparent to me that i'm not the only one in the process of learning Korean because and only because of SNSD. I started about half a year ago when I first started listening to them and I'm not sure what it is exactly, but whenever I listen to an SNSD song, I get a need to understand it and that seems to be enough motivation for me to keep it up. I hope to be able to watch the many variety shows SNSD have appeared on and be able to understand them aswell as all of their songs.


At the moment I am using a program called Rosetta Stone and so far I've learned so much. I'm beginning to understand most of what's being said in some songs and some shows. :)


The point of this thread is to find out how many SONE's are trying to learn and I thought we could all help each other out. Maybe some links to useful websites or just common phrases that are useful to know.

75,2012-8-5,2012,8,5,22,xposw,Looking for some closure. ,My-love_a-tragedy,1344172585,"I'm looking for some closure.


First off, this is going to be a semi-rant, I might end saying things I do not mean, but I'm getting them off my chest. Don't hate me. It's going to be personal, you will probably laugh at me, you will probably think I am crazy, I probably am, and I know this. Ok. Here we go.


What the hell. Why do I love these girls so much? Why does my heart skip a beat when I listen to their music? Why do cry when I watch their videos? Why do I collate folders full of pictures and spend countless hours pining over women I've never even met? Why I do I feel like I know them! Why do I keep coming back for more? I feel like it's unnatural. To be so attached to these strangers. I don't know them. They don't know me. They will never know me. But I know they're beautiful, inside and out. I know they're humble and funny and down to earth, and even if it's only an image, it might as well be the truth because they do it so well. They will never know me. THEY HAVE NO IDEA I EXIST. I could go to their concerts, and could go to a fansign and shake Yoona's hand and I might give her a gift and she might keep it and she might be grateful, but she will never know me. I get DEPRESSED over this - I say this at the risk of trivializing mental illness. I went for weeks in pure apathy, unmotivated, really really sad. It was so weird, because I would listen to their music and I would feel euphoric on the outside, but inside I was crying...


What makes it even worse is that I KNOW I'm not alone. So many sone feel like this. Which is what makes it so frustrating. I'm not different. A thousand sones would cry at the feet of their beauties, and I realise I'm pretty pathetic. Before I became a sone I used to look at Justin Bieber fans and laugh, even pity them, but I now I sympathize, empathize. Even though I'm an 'adult' I'm so bloody immature. I'm nowhere near as extreme as some sones, I keep my scrawny white male face composed when in public, but god damn the feelings are there. IT'S ONLY POP MUSIC. THEY ARE ONLY POP PERFORMERS. There are scientists and doctors out there, who are saving lives, and I choose to dedicate my time to watching some privileged Korean beauty queens dance and sing. Sure, they're talented, but it's only entertainment. It's manufactured. I'm being used. Every single song they sing is perfectly crafted to appeal to certain parts of my brain that keep me spending money. I suppose I can take solace in the fact that at least I'm not delusional. But you know what makes this so bad, you know what makes this hurt so much? I don't regret any of it. I. Love. Them. 


And just by simply typing this out, I have come to a little closure; they will never know me. And that's ok. Because watching these girls grow. Watching them mature. Listening, cheering, dreaming... they will never know me, but I have known them. and that's good enough for me. 


I hope, one day, in five, ten, twenty years. Maybe when I'm 80 years old in a hospital bed, and SNSD are no longer singing and dancing. I hope, I will look back on this time, and I won't be ashamed. Because there have been fads I've been caught up in before, embarrassing things, things I would rather forget. But I hope I don't forget this. I hope I remember the girls, the songs, the feelings. I hope I remember this period for what it was. Because I love those girls. I love the feeling I get from watching and listening to them. I love Yoona and Tiffany and Taeyeon and Hyoyeon and Sunny and Seohyun and Sooyoung and Yuri and Jessica. I hope I look back on these memories with fondness, because they mean so much to me, and I don't want to lose that.


Thank you if you made it this far. I don't care if nobody reads this. Typing it out was closure enough, I'm only pressing 'submit' because I'm an attention seeker :p Also, sorry if I dampened the mood a bit. This is a time to celebrate!


So  ! Well done on 5 years, I hope to see you again in another 5, 10, 15, 30...

What are deemed to be inappropriate comments appear to be sexual in nature, vulgar perhaps too. [Clarificiation; im not saying that the mods have gone overboard with their enforcing (i cant think of a single instance where they have actually enforced it, save for the ""I fap to SNSD"" username)] Names, such as the aforementioned one are sexual in nature and in a formal environment, wouldn't be acceptable, but in most places, i can make masturbatory jokes and be in good standings with most of the people around me (of course i hang out with people with laid back sensibilities, but here it's not okay... the real question, is why not? Girls' Generation is sexual in nature, they are in themselves, despite how little it is admitted, sex symbols. But we cannot treat them as such? we cannot even joke around about their nature? We're all white knights in our heart, and due to what most would call a platonic love for these fellow human beings, fiercely become so. But there is no real need nor reason, They dont go out in short shorts with oiled up legs to show us their talented singing skills, they go to show off their legs, and while we're distracted by that, we get a nice, catchy song too. 
Tl;dr: are we not all rational beings? are we not all human beings, are sexual desires unnatural, and therefore this is not the place for them? (with the pervving on female kpop comment, i feel that we can all say that they are welcome). In all, maybe we don't have to act so prudish?   (sorry for rambling and grammatical errors (fuck editing, man))
EDIT: Just because you dont like a joke (dont find them funny) doesnt mean that no one should have the right to say them, I did not find the username ""I fap to SNSD"" funny, but the guy has the right to name his reddit account whatever, atleast, ideally.",12,0

From hanging out on this sub I've learned that it has happened on occasion, and it's always awesome!  

I realize the timing of their dancing has to be really precise, but any good drummer with a click-track headphone set should be able to take care of that.  As much as I love their performances in any context, the ones with live bands are even better.  Considering the MASSIVE fortune they spend on lighting, costumes, pyrotechnics, sets, etc., it seems kind of silly not to spring a few grand for a live backing band instead of pre-recorded tracks.

Anyway, enough editorializing.  Let's use this thread to compile as many links as we can find to awesome footage of SNSD performing with live backing musicians!!!",10,15
