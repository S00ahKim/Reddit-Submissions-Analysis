Hi guys, some of you may have used the cute SNSD Daum screen saver here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BiVCb3xc0 I recently updated to Windows 10, and now the screen saver only shows as a blank white space instead of the girls animating, does anyone know how to fix this so that it works again please?

There was a fix for the ""outdated"" bug [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/3t1305/daum_screensaver_for_windows_10/) but I don't think this is what I have since my installer doesn't say anything about it being outdated (it isn't even in English, it's in gibberish)",2,7

&gt; You.fucking.know it. That picture. Oh my god. The best picture in kpop history.

What picture is this??? :O I'm just asking out of curiosity. Can anyone show that pic? Thanks! 

On a side note: can't believe it's been 9 years since they debuted. Was a SONE a few years back and recently read about them again cause I heard their latest album on Spotify (lolz I liked it). It's sad to think that they'll be disbanding soon but I guess life just goes on. It'll be the end of an era though.",7,9

A: It's a dating sim.

Q: Um...gross

Q: When can I play it?

A: Soon\*


What I want from you guys/gals: titles! Maybe it will be called ""Soshi: The Video Game"", or ""SimSoshi"" or ""SNSDate"" :) or something else entirely!
It's up to you! Send your name nominations to P.O. Box 429, East- actually you know what just post them here.

In case you're interested, here's [the story so far](http://imgur.com/HityNOX). This basically covers the intro; it's full of exposition and very linear, and probably not much fun. It will get better! (I hope)

Fear not (or alternatively: I'm sorry), there will be no explicit sexual scenes or naughty pictures. I'm aiming to make it fun and light-hearted...although right now it reads kind of like a Tom Clancy novel...it will get better! (I hope)

Hello SONE! [Welcome to the 2016 /R/SNSD BEST SONG TOURNAMENT!](http://i.imgur.com/p12kqGt.gifv)

---

[Ballot](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yFGrchuhd0rSVjZknz0qbaX1OBXz9C1szafXGXhFaX8/viewform) (Open until 2016-01-14 11:59 PM EST)

---

This is the qualifying round; every song is eligible to enter. Please select every song you'd like to see in the tournament. Choose as many as you would like. If you don't see a song, you can enter it manually and I'll add it to the form later. This round will determine two things:

* Number of songs to make it to the next round
* Seeding for next round

After voting is complete, the number of qualified songs will be determined by the vote spread. A ""Round 0"" or some bye-weeks for top seeds may be added to get the number down to an even number. The top ~8 songs will be randomized in seed. 

Voting for this round will remain open until 2016-01-14 11:59 PM EST. The next round will be posted the next morning.

Please do not manipulate the voting process is any way. This is just for fun, and there is no true benefit in your favorite song winning.

Comments, suggestions, or questions? Let me know below.

Edit: Songs added from final question:

* Oppa Nappa (Jessica, Tiffany, Seohyun) in Other
* Only One (Tiffany) in OST
* Wind Flower (Sooyoung) in OST
* It's Love (Sunny &amp; Taeyeon ) in OST
* I Can't Bear Anymore (Bear Song) (Taeyeon, Jessica, Sunny, Seohyun) in OST
* One Step Closer (Tiffany) in OST
* Like a Star (Taeyeon &amp; The One) in Other
* Say Yes (Jessica, f(x) Krystal, EXO Kris) in OST
* Don't Say No (Seohyun &amp; Yoon Gun) in Other
*  [Sparkling] (Yuri) in Other
* Sweet Delight (Jessica) in Other
* Devil's cry (Taeyeon) in Other
* FM Date Theme Song (Sunny) in Other

 (Cold Noodles) = Naengmyun. I will count that vote under  (Cold Noodles). ""Let's Go"" by Group 20 (with Seohyun) was not added, as she is a featured artist rather than a main artist. Cooky is in Other and Not Alone is in Girls' &amp; Peace. They will be manually counted.

To the user that accidentally submitted 3x, I manually deleted two of your entries. ",6,21

Hello SONE! 

The qualifying round is now complete. 214 songs were eligible in the qualifying round. Amazingly, cutting off at 20 votes left 128 remaining songs, a perfect number for a bracket. Merry Go Round, Telepathy, Top Secret, One Afternoon, and Diamond barely missed the cut. Every song got at least two votes. The highest number of votes for a song was 105. You can see more info about the disqualified songs in the Complete Standings link, which will be updated as the tournament continues.

This tournament will be double-elimination. How the seeds were made:

1. All songs were ranked in order by vote count
2. Songs were placed in vote count tiers based on groupings of ten (90+, 89-80, 79-70, 69-60, etc.)

Hello SONE! 

Round 1, Group AB is now complete with 104 votes cast (the link says 106, but two ballots were completely blank.) Four upsets occurred, including (80) Baby Baby trouncing (49) Reflection 59-36. The biggest blowout was (4) Tell Me Your Wish defeating (125) Promise 97-7. Three matchups were decided by five votes or less. Your vote is important, so make it count!

Today, Group CD faces off. Also, the Losers Bracket begins. How long will songs like Devil's Cry and T.O.P hang on after tough first round matchups? 

---

I think this will be the most questions asked at one time. I'm also changing the time the ballots open/close to make it easier on me. If you do not have an opinion towards either song, you may leave the answer blank. Also, check out this awesome comment by /u/YeaNote of [all the songs in Group AB](https://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/413dzt/2016_rsnsd_song_tournament_round_1_groups_ab/cz06yro).

I will have some photos from the concert up tonight.



On the 23rd, I arrived in Saitama and met up with /u/lejjito at the Saitama Super Arena. We waited in line for good for a few hours. It was amazing seeing so many people! And they are all fans, too! Everyone was decked out in Soshi gear or even cosplaying. There were hundreds of people in line! /u/lejjito said by 10 am or so there were already 1300 people in line for goods! And the goods shop didn't open until 2 pm! So we waited and chatted about the girls and were able to get some items. Many things had already sold out by the time we got to the front. After, we had some food and met up with @chicagosone since lejjito was selling him a ticket for the day. 


When we met him, I told him how it was my first GG only concert and that I didn't have a ticket for that day, but for the next  day. He suggested I hold a sign up saying I'd like to buy a ticket, and maybe I'd get lucky because some people had gotten upgraded seats or friends maybe didn't show up. A lot of people had been trading trading cards earlier, so I got a spark of hope! I quickly drew up a sign and parted ways with them so they could get seats in the concert. I walked around outside and in the underground mall area with my sign, looking sad, and hoping someone would take pity. Someone approached me about the sign, but only had tickets for the next day (which I already had). 



I then moved back to the front of arena, and was pretty resigned to my fate of no ticket, watching throngs or people wade into the arena. It was then that three 30-40s ladies approached me! (In Japanese), they asked me if I was looking for a ticket for today and I said yes and they had an extra because their friend didn't show up. They kindly sold their ticket to me for not too much more than what my next day ticket cost. I was so thankful! They were very kind about it! I even got to sit next to them and cheer the girls on! They were extremely kind and kept an eye on me and made sure I got through security and everything okay. When we go to security, we were given a little Sone Japan bag that had the concert light stick and a sticker. The arena was HUUUUUGGEEE and took forever to walk all the say to our seats. I was on the 400 level on the left of the middle (map included) which was actually just the first balcony. I was in the third row of my section and had no one in front of me because of the way the incline worked. The seat was fantastic!! I had a great view of the whole arena from the near middle back. 



Now to the concert account:
Everyone's lightsticks all lit pink was just magical. The pink ocean is truly something to behold. It's hard to describe the magnitude of the super arena pink ocean. It's like another world. You really get the feeling of how loved Soshi is. Everyone was busy chatting and some people chanting for Soshi. And then. The lights lowered and the first VCR came on the screen. And we all screamed and cheered and waved our sticks! The first VCR had the girls whispering words in English and Korean and Japanese and maybe other languages and included the girls in white dresses in a field (and on a piano like from of the Instagram teases). After, they perfectly opened with You Think. It was so bad ass and powerful and everyone screamed! Their first outfits were a dark navy sequin-covered long blazer and white feather skirt underneath. They then went into the jazz version of Genie, which, oh my god. Was so fucking amazing. I can't even describe it. It was sexy and fun and something different. Then for the long awaited Bump It. I couldn't keep my eyes open wide enough for it!! During Bump It, each of the girls got a short solo dance. Unfortunately, the spotlight malfunctioned for the first three girls so were weren't able to see them. At the end of Bump It, though, they ripped off their jackets to reveal sleeveless white feathery dresses covered in metal O rings. Super cute and sexy at the same time! They had a cute conversational opening to Show girls and Tiffany gave the best fan service when introducing the song! The set had Show Girls lit up old theater style on huge platforms. 



After this, the girls all introduced themselves as cute as ever. Next was Paparazzi which AlWAYS KILLS BECAUSE PAPPARAZI IS THEIR BEST JAPANESE SONG! Then there was a cute, but strange, cartoon VCR of the girls walking through a cute, cartoony, bright wonderland. The stage then had on it a giant setting in the front that matched the items in the VCR. A giant shoe, dress form, diamond ring, perfume bottle, makeup compact, and bow. They were arranged in a circle and could spin and the girls could sit on the items while it spun. When they came out, they were wearing their third outfit, which was my favorite. It was an adorable harlequin diamond dress in purple, orange, and green with bunny ears. The outfit was so adorable and had fluffy, color petticoats underneath! It was so puffy and swung around as they danced. They first sang Kissing You and then Oh!. After, the giant LED screen background of the set changed into a Card Matching game where the cards had different members. The girls had to ""press"" giant LED ""buttons"" to play the match game while they sang and danced to Beep Beep. It was a really cute interaction and use of the giant LED board. Then they sang Paradise from Lion Heart and there were lovely flower covered swings, chairs, and benches placed high up on the set and on platforms. It was lovely and the LED background changed to the sky and flowers. It was like being in a pretty garden! Like Paradise haha. 



Then, there was a little Photo booth on top of the stage and the girls went in a few at a time, sometimes playing rock paper scissors to decide who would go in. After they went in, there would be clicks and giant snapshots of the girls showed up on the giant screen. Then, they were all gone and we got our third VCR of a security guard getting stuck in a magic photo booth! In the next section we got our awesome group acts! First, Adrenaline! TaeTiseo were wearing white outfits and had dresses and outfits projected onto them in front of the giant LED board. It was amazing seeing Adrenaline in person! The dance is so awesome! After, Yoona and Sunny entered the audience from the back of the arena singing Maroon 5's Sugar. They were wearing cute pink and white christmassy dresses. The met in the middle, criss-crossed, and went through the floor audience to the stage. We were able to see them pretty close from where I was sitting and screamed as they walked nearby. Sunny got a little delayed trying to highfive everyone in the audience and had to run a little at the end to meet Yoona on the stage. I love that they walked through the crowd like that. Next, was our lovely SHY's Push It stage. I think this was when I screamed the hardest. It was BAD ASS! Those girls can really dance! I was so excited to see the stage, plus I also love Salt n Pepa.



When the girls came out again they were in their fourth outfit. A sexy dark blue and gold number a-la Lion Heart performances. During this costume, they sang Lion Heart, Party, and Gee. I was a little sad because it was regular Party and not the winter version from the Seoul concert. Another VCR of Yoona using a computer to hack/access an AI System. Then there was a giant octagon in the middle of the stage, with one girl in each side behind a screen. They started with Mr. Mr. and the girls would be displayed in their side of the octagon when it was their part, and there would also be holograms on the sides sometimes. They were wearing futuristic silver space outfits with thigh high boots for this. We got a little light show for this performance which was super cool. Then Galaxy SuperNova. 
They then teased The Great Escape, but actually went into Run Devil Run during which they would step into small booths and the specific girl would show up displayed on the booth hologram style. 



There was a short VCR then with Yuri, Seohyun, Hyoyeon, and Sooyoung that included a desert and each girl trying to become the person they want. Sooyoung to shed the princess life, Seohyun to become a better ballerina, Yuri to be a better swimmer, and Hyoyeon to be a better rock climber. After, the girls came out wearing military green and gold outfits with white crop tops that were reminiscient of Yuri's If performance. They sang Catch me if you Can, Mr. Taxi, and Fire Alarm (which had a lot of fireballs). During Fire Alarm, there were two very loud explosions which surprised me quite a lot and actually took Taeyeon off guard during her singing part. After, They did The Boys and Indestructible. At the end of Indestructible, the girls were lowered behind the stage and that was the ""end"" of the concert. We all called out for the girls to continue. So Nyu Shi Dae! So Nyu Shi Dae!



There was another VCR during which the girls were sitting in a circle like at a cafe and talking about stuff. I was sure exactly what they were talking about. In the encore, they were wearing the black leather skirt and pink t-shirt outfits. Cute and comfy! They sang Snowy Wish and did a lot of walking around the stage and fan service. Then they sang Flyers and got into Santa sled-looking moving stages and were ferried around the audience throwing autographed balls and special Phantasia marshmallows into the audience. They got pretty close to us, which was awesome but no one threw things up to our balcony because it was a little far. Then they gathered on the stage again and did a christmas version of Love and Girls which started with an intro reminding us how to do the dance and for all of us to do that dance together! :D During the performance, they got into a giant bathtub covered in balloons and streamers and things. They spent some time being adorable and taking selfies with the bathtub and the audience, too. They had us all go the right now, from now on, forever Girls' Generation! And then they asked us to do it but replace Girls' Generation with Sone! &lt;3 They wished us many thanks, got into the bathtub, and the tub took them away. After a few minutes, the credits rolled and an ADORABLE Christmas video started of the girls recording each other and playing and talking like at a christmas party.



The whole concert was just magical! I couldn't believe I was lucky enough to get tickets for the first  day and that I would get to go both days! I was unbelievably lucky!!



The second day, I waited in line for goods for 5 hours (FREEZING COLD!), but it was worth it because I was able to get all the goods I wanted. And through some trading with other SONEs, I was able to obtain all 18 unique trading cards! This concert day I was also in the 400 (first balcony) sitting area, but right in the middle. This was an even better view. Also, this day I had my camera (shame on me), and my binoculars. Binoculars are practically required at these kinds of concerts because normally you're so far away that you can barely see. It was fricken amazing having my binoculars this day and actually being able to see them up close!! Definitely, remember binoculars.



I know this fan account isn't as good as a video, but it's the best I can do. I hope you are able to get some feeling of the show from it.

Hello SONE! 

Round 1 is now complete. Things went a little more expected this time, with only two upsets. (3) I (Taeyeon Solo) could not be stopped, beating (126)  (Love Sick)(TaeTiSeo) 71-6. In the losers bracket, (61)     (Forever) barely stayed alive, defeating (125) Promise 28-24. 

Today, Round 2 begins, while Round 1 in the losers bracket finishes. In Match 110, Divine and Indestructible, two of the last songs as OT9 duke it out.

I figure that this subreddit is the best place to get help from. I was working on a project for a course last semester where I analyze this [Genie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3RTc-8J3CU) video. I needed to track their faces and classify who it belongs to. There wasn't any previous SNSD dataset online that is readily available, so I decided to collect my own. However, I severely underestimated the scope of the project and only collected a handful self annotated data. The result was very poor and I ended up misclassifying most faces. 

Now that new semester has begun, I really want to fix this project and improve the classification rate. The faceshots and dataset will be accessible to everyone for anyone to use. I would greatly appreciate any help :)

Let me just finish off by saying that this project **is just for fun and no longer for a school project**. If you know or have any list of urls of SNSD's members faceshots/selca/candid/stage performance, from current or past, please send it my way at snsddataset@gmail.com. Please send names so I can give proper credits :)

Or contribute over on [github](https://github.com/g3nie) by making pull requests.

Sample small dataset:
http://imgur.com/a/CbQs6
https://github.com/g3nie/g3nie/blob/master/gg_dataset.txt

If you want to contribute by annotating/labelling, that would also be really great. Please follow the format of the txt file!
Format is as follow: 

""Name AnyNumber TopCoordinateOfFace,BottomCoordinateOfFace URL Era"" 

For example:

""taeyeon		1		126,122,333,342			http://kpopselca.com/selca/364_taeyeon-genie-selca.jpg Genie""


Failed result:
https://gfycat.com/HonoredIlliterateHarlequinbug
Everybody was classified differently (but albeit very poorly), due to a small mistake in the code, everyone was accidentally labeled as Yoona. 

Thank you everyone again!",3,13

Hello SONE! 

Round 2 is midway through. The higher seeds dominated, with eleven wins at more than a 2:1 ratio. The only upset was (33) Dear Santa beating (32) Green Light 47-42, and even that's a bit of a stretch to call an upset. The complete standings have been updated with every song eliminated so far. The tie breaker is the number of votes received in the Qualifying Round. 

Today, Round 2 finishes. Also, Losers Round 2, Group B will take place ahead of Losers Round 2, Group A. Make sure to vote in the Losers Ballot too, as most match ups went down to the wire. Happy Voting!",2,11

Hello SONE! 

Round 2 is now complete. The higher seeds were undefeated in Groups CD. Meanwhile in the Losers Bracket, the first tie occurred between (37) Indestructible and (79) Girls at 23-23. Since Indestructible had more votes in the Qualifying Round than Girls (43-31), Indestructible moves on. A lot of the other match ups in the Losers Bracket were close as well. 

Today, Round 3 begins out of order with Groups CD going first. To speed up the Losers Bracket, part of Round 3 will begin while Part 2 ends. Happy Voting!

Hello SONE! 

Round 3 is over. Two big upsets occurred in the Main Bracket, including (25) U R (Taeyeon Solo) defeating (8) The Boys (Korean Version). There were some surprises in the Losers Bracket too, including (38) Love &amp; Girls and (39) Complete.

Today, Round 4 begins. I'm curious to see the outcome of (1) Mr. Mr. vs (16) I Got A Boy. Happy voting!",8,9

Ayo SONE! 

Round 4 is complete. (2) Galaxy Supernova barely held on to beat (15) You Think 38-37.

We're down to twenty songs now. At this time, I'd like to friendly remind everyone to please only vote one time. I haven't seen anything that looks suspicious in the full results, but please be courteous to others and be honest. There truly is no benefit to your favorite song winning, so lets keep this fair and fun for everyone.

Also, check out the Complete Standings. They've been updated for the first time in a while. You can really see how the random tiered seedings have affected some songs. Happy Voting!",3,13

It's a very important video for me as a SONE and I was wondering if it exists in a better resolution than 480p.
