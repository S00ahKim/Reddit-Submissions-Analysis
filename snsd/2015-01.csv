I've now asked the moderators over at /r/kpics and they've generously allowed me to borrow their gold trophy flair, so congratulations guys, hope you all keep posting to keep the subreddit bright and shiny!! \^^

Hi guys, last week /u/YoonASNSDFan and I entered us into Reddit's [Best of 2014 Awards](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/2qbk8s/nominate_and_vote_in_rsnsds_2014_best_of_awards/), and today I'd like to announce the winners and give out the Reddit Gold prizes to the much-deserved winners! :)

Without further ado, the winners are...

* **Best Picture/Photo**

[Sunny stop](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/2mgb8r/sunny_stop/) by /u/leesoonkyu, an adorable candid photograph of Sunny in glasses, hard at work at her job as the host of the MBC radio show host of Sunny FM Date.

* **Best Gif**

[Wha? My flowers aren't pink.. Hers are.. She'll know what to do...](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/2i8xcb/wha_my_flowers_arent_pink_hers_are_shell_know/) by /u/Shakmir, a cute moment capturing how well the Soshi sisters know each other, as without a word Tiffany manages to switch her bouquet with Seohyun for one in her favourite colour, pink! 

* **Best Original Fan Art** 

[Yuri](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/2oecoy/happy_birthday_yuri_fanart/) by /u/noir0083, a striking portrait of our Black Pearl made for her birthday by one of the most talented fan artists today with an inimitably unique artstyle and one who works closely with Soshified.

* **Most Helpful Community-Oriented Post**

[SNSD for dummies](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/1untiq/snsd_for_dummies_a_new_fans_guide/) by /u/notajenius, a fun page intended as an introductory primer to new Sones but one which older veterans also thoroughly enjoy with its gold mine of cute gifs and links to classic video clips which is why it has cemented its place on our subreddit sidebar.

* **Community Choice Award**

/u/secretchordx for continued translations, a translator and subber so prolific and Messianic that you'd never know she only joined the fandom in 2014, but continues to work tirelessly in delivering the word of all the girls to the international fans. 

Since she began, she has subbed The TTS show, radio shows, Holler comeback clips, Instagram uploads and comments, and small clips here and there - no clip too insignificant to translate, no stone left unturned. Subscribe to her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/stellahklee), [Dailymotion channel](http://www.dailymotion.com/stellahklee) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SonexStella) for updates! :)

---

And finally thank YOU all for nominating, voting, participating, and most of all simply ENJOYING what our subreddit and fandom has to offer. Our community is kept afloat by YOUR submissions and comments, so if you see something you'd like to share, have a question you'd like to ask, or even just saying a quick word of thanks, it all means a lot to everyone. Happy 2015 Sones, and hope to see you all around the subreddit more often! \^^

EDIT: Err thanks for the Reddit Gold stranger, didn't expect that but thanks lol! ",12,37

Musical &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt; Actress, Seohyun

What would it have been like when people heard Phoebe Cates, the poster child of purity, had the role of a Bond Girl in the 007 Series? When we heard that SNSDs maknae, Seohyun had been chosen as &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt;s Scarlett OHara, similar thoughts emerged in our heads. 

Like when Phoebe Cates, wearing a flirty dress, blew hoo on a handgun, it seems possible on text but it did not match the image in our heads. Scarlett OHara is arrogant and bourgeois. To ensnare a man she likes, even married men do not stop her and she is poised to attack, dedicated to her cravings. She is also ambitious enough to hold hands with people she dislikes to raise her family standing. 

However, even in variety shows everyone enjoys and laughs at, Seohyun encouraged her pretend husband to read while emphasizing the importance of being cultured and she has also done a duet with Ju Hyun-Mi, queen of trot. Righteous and stubborn Seohyun is a character with an extremely unique positioning within girl groups.

It is not an exaggeration to say that perhaps the role of pretty and intelligent Yeon-Woo, who she portrayed in her previous musical &lt;Moon Embracing the Sun&gt; is a product of the image that Seohyun has been building all this time. 

To answer the questions that come to our heads, it would be fastest and most accurate to hear straight from the person in question. We visited the rehearsal room to meet Seohyun, ask our questions and hear her answers. 

Q: Theres a significant gap between the Seohyun that the general public knows and Scarlett OHara of &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt;. Lets get it straight. Why are you doing this piece?

A: Thats what made me want to do it more desperately. Theres a tendency of a specific image being emphasized on me. My appearances that you see on variety shows are only a part of who I am but it tends to reflect on me entirely. And even more so as Im the maknae within the group. More than anything, the reason why I wanted to do this piece was because I related with Scarlett in many ways. I also thought it would be a good opportunity to show a different side of me. It was overwhelming because its such a huge piece but I actively appealed to the producers. I confidently said, I can do this really well and I think it was looked upon favorably by the producers.

Q: What do you feel are the similarities between you and Scarlett?

A: Her utmost love for herself. Does Scarlett have a strong sense of self-love? Im like that too. Im stubborn and have clear opinions so I am not easily swayed by the opinions of others. I dont concern myself with the gazes of others and rather than being led by someone else, I live my life through my own choices and I think we are similar in that way. Normally I really hate doing something because Im told to do it. But if someone properly explains the feasibility of a task and if Im convinced, I accept it well and I work hard. I stay away from conflict. 

Q: To the general public, the image associated with Scarlett OHara is very clear and fixed. Seohyun, what kind of a person do you think Scarlett OHara is?

A: To study Scarlett, I read the &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt; novel in its entirety. It was very thick (laughs). Scarlett is definitely selfish and only cares about herself. However, I also think she is mostly a product of her environment. As a woman, I think theres not much you can do if youre placed in that situation. As well, I understand when she chooses emotionally rather than rationally, as a woman. As a female actor  everyone can empathize  its a role you want to play. I want to portray all of these facets well on stage. 

Q: What are the differences between your previous work in &lt;Moon Embracing the Sun&gt; and &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt;?

A: First of all, the gestures are really different. In &lt;Moon Embracing the Sun&gt;, gestures were timid with folded hands and walking backwards but with this one, the gestures are expressed more regally. When Im singing, there are less vocal tricks involved. In French pieces, the element of pop is strong in vocals. So Im learning by constantly communicating with the musical director. 

Q: Is there a difference when you stand on stage as a singer compared to when you stand on stage as a musical actress?

A: Of course. When you stand as a singer, youre there as yourself and you try your best to give happiness to the audience. When you stand as a musical actress, youre playing a role so you focus on bringing the character to life as best as you can within the given time and space. 

Q: These days, idol group members are pursuing various fields. Often they become actors or MCs but why did you choose musicals out of the various paths?

A: I really like musicals. When I go to New York for SNSD activities, I always buy tickets ahead of time for musicals I want to see. Of the shows I saw recently in New York, &lt;Matilda&gt; was most memorable. Im not sure if its because of a cultural difference but I was refreshingly shocked by seeing young friends leading a show for almost 3 hours. Its an amount of time thats not easy even for adults but their energy was impressive. I was also impacted with the thought that I should work even harder. This year, I saw musicals in Korea whenever I had time and I think I saw approximately 20 shows. 

Q: Thats incredible dedication that you saw 20 shows with your busy activities. Which character did you covet the most?

A: Its difficult to choose one Glinda from &lt;Wicked&gt;. The show itself is fun and I think Glinda matches well with my image. I saw &lt;Wicked&gt; in New York for the first time; I fell in love with it and I think Ive seen it about ten times. I search related videos on the internet and watched almost all of them. I saw a production they did in France. The funny thing is, when I first watched it in New York, I thought (Ock) Joo-Hyun unni would be so well suited for the show and Joo-Hyun unni really ended up being in the show. 

Q: What drew you to &lt;Wicked&gt;?

A: I like the musical numbers and the characters but most of all, I really like the message contained within the piece. At first, I thought of it as a kids show but the more I watch it, the more I learn and feel. Thats why I kept searching here and there and watched it again so I dont miss any messages within the piece. I was so into &lt;Wicked&gt; that even my parents would say youre crazy. I think crazy is the right expression. After seeing in ten times, I feel like I know it well and I am greedy for the role. But to do a piece of this magnitude, I need to learn various sounds. So I am diligently taking voice lessons.

Q: Coincidentally, the other actress who was double-cast as Scarlett OHara is Bada, who was in SM Entertainments S.E.S. Is it burdensome?

A: The fact that I get to stand on the same stage as unni is really, really a huge honor. The reason why I started cultivating the dream of becoming a singer is because of S.E.S. and Fin.K.L unnis. Truthfully, I didnt know what to do with myself when I was double cast in the same role as an unni like that. In some ways, I also think this opportunity was given to me because Bada unni and Joo-Hyun unni solidly claimed their place in musicals. I feel a responsibility to do well in this piece so I can be a lighthouse for the hoobaes who will come after me.

Margaret Mitchells novel, Gone with the Wind is a very American piece. Against the backdrop of Tara, a Southern plantation, during the American Civil War, it contains the eventful life story of Scarlett OHara, daughter of the farmer. A French producing team turned this novel into a musical. Grard Presgurvic, who is known within South Korea with Romeo &amp; Juliet, is composer and lyricist. A licensed Korean production is currently being staged at the Seoul Arts Centre in the Opera Theatre. 

Even though it has been converted into a breathless version, the audience is empathetic to this musical because they effectively reconstructed the main character Scarletts life. A woman who is beautiful, bourgeois and at times, overbearing ; her desires, loves and struggles within the massive waves of history envelopes you with deep impressions and pathos. In the last scene, as a bankrupt Scarlett famously tells herself, Yes, tomorrow, tomorrows sun will rise again, a thought comes to our head that makes us reflect on the meaning of life. This is what transcends time and space. (Note: I believe the actual quote in English is After all... tomorrow is another day! but above is translated directly from the article.) 

Among this, the most refreshing shock was Seohyun, who is in the role of Scarlett. Truthfully, condensing a vast original work into a two-hour musical is not an easy task. The characters as well as the story have to be communicated through feeling. Even though Seohyun is a musical rookie, she showed us energy beyond expectation and digested a role that is not easy. This is her second musical role after Moon Embracing the Sun. We know her well as a SNSD member who sings well but it was really great to listen to her voice separately. Her ability to bring emotion through song, the most important part of a musical, rivaled that of a veteran actor. Despite a short career, she endlessly showed us various colours and peculiar charms of womans life. Here and there in connecting dialogues, you did notice clumsy acting but overall, her performance was more than enough to get a passing grade. It was as if we were watching Ock Joo-Hyun during her rookie days, a musical sunbae who came from a similar girl group background. 

Im Tae-Kyung, who is in the role of the classy, wealthy and sexy Rhett Butler, showed off charisma like a top musical star and balanced Scarlett well. The point of this piece is the chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett Butler and the two actors held the weight of the characters well, and with the harmony among supporting cast and ensemble, the whole piece came to life. 

Typically in French musicals, music and dance are separate from the on-stage set. However, this piece decorated the stage and costumes realistically and in splendor, and the music often employs pop ballad style so its less French than you would think. Only the powerful choreography follows tradition; the dance itself is great but it seems distanced from the storyline. 

Among this, the effort put into the stage set shows. The garden and ballroom scenes are memorable, and the video footage helps bring the mood of the piece to life. Lastly, some of the dialogue stands out due to translation into Korean. There is a need to refine and smooth it out further. Until February 15th, at the Seoul Arts Centre, Opera Theatre.

For those of you who don't know, Heroes of the Storm (HOTS) is a LoL/Dota-style online multiplayer PC game made by Blizzard, encompassing characters from Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ecv0bT9DEo

Because it's a multiplayer team game, it's more fun to play with friends so I've started up a Skype group where we can play premades on the EU server with voicechat. We've got about 10 Sones at the moment and we're always looking for more! If you're interested, add my Battletag as arthurmauk#2633 and my Skype as arthurmauk, or post a comment below with your Server, Battletag and Skype name. Hope to see you on the Nexus soon! :)

I can't really discuss this with anyone else since my best SONE buddy left the fandom after the issue, so yeah...
Btw I was sure and still am sure regardless of this that Sica and Tyler are dating, and if he is a good guy I really have nothing against it but because he's questionable in many aspects I can't really say that's the case.

Not sure if it's my favorite per se but just as an example i'm going with ""Cheap Creeper""

As it was a pretty long time since I watched it, I forgot some details but I will try to explain as well as I can. 

It was about one of their stylists talking about which snsd outfits were most expensive. I think the most expensive one was Taengoo's dress in the teaser pictures for the Boys. I am truly sorry but this is all I remember. 

I hope someone might remember this video too and send me the link. I would really appreciate that a lot. (I am extremely sorry for possible mistakes, english is not my first language and this is also my first time posting) Thanks!

445,2015-1-26,2015,1,26,11,2tojf4,[TRANS] Gone with the Wind Actor Seohyuns Potential (Musical Review),secretchordx,1422240434,"A girl became an actor. 

Through the musical Gone with the Wind, girl group SNSDs Seohyun proved her potential as a musical actor. Last year, she went on stage in Moon Embracing the Sun and with Gone with the Wind Seohyun is on stage for the second time. One would predict that the role of the main character in a large show would be incredibly overwhelming but Seohyun owned the stage beyond expectation.

Truthfully, you cant say that Gone with the Wind is a well-done piece. Overall, it is overwhelming to translate the formidable source material drama to stage. Due to limited development, flow keeps getting disconnected and the emotional story of the movie or the novel disappeared.

Since the film is so famous, many audiences probably expect the emotional connection to the film or the small details of the original novel. However, it was difficult to find either in the 2-hour stage rendition of Gone with the Wind. I expected a magnificent stage but the somewhat erratic environment lost steam. Of course you have to look at the fact that a musical is a different medium than a film or a novel, to fans of the originals, this performance definitely had to have been disappointing.

Despite that, Seohyuns attempt is praiseworthy. In the piece, Seohyun is in the role of Scarlett OHara, who transforms from a spoiled lady who needs to have everything she wants to a strong woman who explores her fate after experiencing war. She earned applause for her acting and singing skills that were above and beyond expectation. 

As this is only her second musical, to Seohyun, who is only just entering the road of a musical actor, playing Scarlett OHara in Gone with the Wind is an incredibly huge role. This character needs to find the centre of the piece in a large theatre performance. More than anything, if you dont own the stage with acting and singing skills, the whole performance itself can collapse.

Seohyun cannot surpass the explosive vocal skills or the onstage comfort level of Bada, who is sharing the role with her, but she is successful in expressing her own Scarlett OHara. With a fierce voice, she expressed an arrogant Scarlett OHara and her clean voice complimented the role. More than anything, Seohyuns singing surpassed expectations. It wasnt powerful but it was pure like a girl, while also robust and sharp. 

She followed Scarlett OHaras emotions well. She acted the role well, depicting a spoiled lady who becomes increasingly strong after experiencing a war. In scenes that explode with emotion or tears, she does well. I cant say she perfectly expresses Scarlett in every moment but she definitely showed her potential for growth as an actor. 

Seohyun has said, The most important part is that I have to perfectly embody Scarlett. I looked at the piece many times and while looking in the mirror, I thought to myself, I am Scarlett. I tried hard to emulate her gestures and behaviours in normal life. Not only on stage but I am trying hard to think that I am living as Scarlett. 

After digesting one drama and two musicals, Seohyun is entering the road as an actor. From the beginning, she is making bold attempts and showing proof of her potential so we are curious what move she will make next as an actor.

**Q: In today's photoshoot, most of the outfits that appear are your clothes, Sooyoung. We heard you are donating all of these clothes to benefit the visually impaired. How did you come to have such praiseworthy thoughts?**

A: My father helps run a campaign that fights blindness for people suffering from a rare disease called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). With the help of many people over the years, we raised enough money for research to begin and this year, the Seoul University hospital ophthalmology department will start clinical research for stem cells, specifically for RP patients. I was very thrilled so I wanted to find a way that I could help, which led me to host a bazaar using items found inside of my closet. 


**Q: Tell us where it will take place and how.** 

A: It will be at the Heartist House in Samcheongdong on February 1. We'll have items from my closet as well as treasures from fellow celebrities up for auction. For my clothes, I chose items that made an appearance as airport fashion. If you were ever curious about my airport fashion looks, please visit that day. 


**Q: In your opinion, what do you think is the hidden item at this bazaar?**

A: My first big fashion purchase was a Burberry Prorsum mouton jacket, but I've barely worn it so it's as if it's new. There is also an outfit that made news as one of the first airport fashion. I wore a grey jacket with a sequined, flower pattern skirt. I'm planning to sell that skirt. Other than that I think the Theyskens' Theory leather jacket and motorcycle boots, as well as my favourite sneakers will be popular.


**Q: Of the SNSD members, you are known as a member who has a lot of interest in fashion, along with Tiffany. Is there a designer or fashion label that has caught your eyes recently?**

A: These days, I think Acne Studio's Jonny Johansson and MSGM's Massimo Giorgetti are the best. I like French style so Isabel Marant is a brand that I have favoured for a long time now. Recently, I also like Japanese brands like Yaeca and CABANE de ZUCCa. As time goes by, I like comfortable clothes more.


**Q: What type of item takes up the most room in your closet?**

A: I recently opened my drawers and have been surprised by the number of white T-shirts I own. I had several drawers filled with white T-shirts of varying sleeve length, neck line and materials. Personally, I think innerwear determines the overall fit. And typically, white T-shirts are not burdensome in price so I think I end up keep buying them.


**Q: According to Alexander Wang, people who are well-dressed on their off days are the ones who dress well. What do you wear on days when you don't have a schedule?** (Note: His famous quote is, ""Anyone can get dressed up and glamorous but it is how people dress in their days off that are the most intriguing."") 

A: Sweatshirt and jeans. I wear a biker jacket or oversized coat on top. For shoes, I mostly wear comfortable sneakers. On the days I want to dress up a bit more, I wear a leather skirt with a printed sweatshirt and match the leggings and a slip-on. On special days like this, I carry a mini bag. 


**Q: If you could name one woman who dresses well?**

A: Charlotte Gainsbourg. More so than dressing well, I think it's important to show off your own personal ambience. Gainsbourg is like that. 


**Q: Recently, 1990s fashion has been getting attention again. Is there an icon from the 1990s that you like?**

A: By far, it's Kate Moss. Even now, I look up Kate Moss's paparazzi looks. She is still cool but 1990s Kate was the best. Unisex mood and straight denim. Makeup-less real face is a style that she created.


**Q: Is there an old trend that you'd like to see back?** 

A: I was happy to see suspender pants coming back, which were fads when I was in elementary school. If super curly perm hair came back on top of this, I wouldn't wish for anything more. I like Meg Ryan's short cut perm hair and I think the hairstyle from the movie &lt;Curly Sue&gt; with curly bangs would be cute too. If it doesn't affect the concept of our next album, I want to try it right away.


**Q: These days, there are various fashion programs but if you could create your own, what type of program would you attempt?**

A: A program where you travel around the world to understand the local trends and then you coach people on the ""real"" way. I want to see trends in New York, Paris or Milan, where collections are born, and I want to teach people how they can wear those looks. I feel like collections become monopolies of fashion people. Wouldn't the fashion program become one that you can study, experiment and research?


**Q: Is there a single item that you think you can wear for life?** 

A: Not long ago, I bought an oversized black coat. The length almost reaches my ankles. It looks like a coat that my mom used to wear in the 1980s or the suit coat that my dad pulls out every winter. If you match with blue jeans and sneakers, I feel like a boy and if you match with high-waisted pants or skirt and stiletto, I turn into a career woman.


**Q: Is there an item that you've been eyeing in 2015 S/S collections?**

A: Knee length skirts. I'm starting to get tired of blue jeans. If I say this, I'm sure my mom will scold me. She'll ask what I'll do with all of the blue jeans I have in my closet. 


**Q: The reason why you can wear any clothes so perfectly must be because of your tall height and skinny body line? Do you have a special method for maintaining a shape that fits 44 size perfectly?** (Note: Korean size 44 = XS; US 0-2; UK 4; Europe 32) 

A: I feel like people will think I'm absurd, but I don't gain weight. Through exercise, I try to maintain enough muscle.


**Q: You must have times when you do your own makeup? Give us makeup tips for Valentine's Day.**

A: Do a thin and transparent layer of foundation on your skin and add loveliness with a peach tone shadow and cream blusher. For eyes, add a touch of eyeliner and apply mascara lightly. Normally, I don't wear makeup but when I go to the airport, I put on 'courtesy makeup'. After applying mascara, I use a one-time use iron to prevent clumping. I usually heat up a wooden cotton swab or skewers you find in the kitchen, and it's very effective.


**Q: Last year, you succeeded as an actor. Is there a character you'd like to attempt?**

A: A selfish woman who exists in reality and is not overly dramatic. Not a woman who openly behaves badly but a woman who appears normal but has a mean streak. If you look at their behaviour, they're nasty but should I say a character that you can relate to because you feel like you've been that person before? My wish as an actor is, if I have a chance, I would like to participate in a piece by writer Noh Hee-Kyung.


**Q: Is there something you'd like to conquer in 2015?**

A: Swimming! My name is ""soo young"" but I can't swim. (Note: In Korean, ""soo young"" means swim.)

From my understanding, when Geri left they weren't on good terms. Years later they put aside differences and have remained friends. It just bums me out that SNSD have practically grown up together. They should know one another well enough by now to have talked about different career paths. 

I know by now that some of girls have commented in a round about way about the situation,  but we dnt really know their side of the story and probably never will. I don't think scheduling conflicts and priorities were to blame b/c I can't remember the last time Jess didn't attend an event. in the past year Soo and YoonA have had crazy schedules and missed events but apparently thats ok. Plus they all have individual projects so what was wrong with B&amp;E? Ever since this whole fiasco started I've kept to myself. I needed to vent :/ All I know is that I will continue to support ot9. SNSD was my first kpop group and I thought they were untouchable.

She is SNSDs Sunny, who reverses fatigue on your way home from work. It has been 8 months since she took her first steps as a DJ at MBC FM4Us Sunnys FM Date (FM Date onwards). She receives a lot of love from listeners and already has the nickname of SoonD (combination of real name Lee Soon-Kyu + DJ). We asked her about the charm of radio. 

Corner 1: FM Date microphone, it took nearly 22 years to come to Sunny
I can show human Lee Soon-Kyu, not Sunny. On stage, you have to look cool but in front of a microphone, you have to be human, right? I really like that. 

FM Date, which is the object of Sunnys affection, began airing in November of 1992, when she was only 3 years old. In the early days, it aired from 9 to 11 pm and actor Lee Seung-Yeon was the invited DJ who was responsible for carrying on the show. After Go So-Young, Park So-Hyun, Lee Eui-Jung, Kim Hyun-Joo and MBC Kang Da-Som announcer, the microphone came to Sunny. 

There was a time when FM Date temporarily disappeared as well. In 1999, it was abolished after reorganization and was replaced by a variety of programs like Click! 1020, Double Impact and Close Friend.  In 2013, with reorganization in the fall, FM Date was resurrected after 13 years.  

FM Date has an eternal history. Sunnys shoulder must be heavy with the weight of so many DJs before her. We want to know what makes her unique and her strategy. 

Corner 2: Small interview in the booth Sunny FM Date? To me, its like school.  
**Q: What are the best and worst qualities of DJ Sunny?**

A: My best quality is familiarity. Since I have already been active for 8 years as SNSD, many people already know me well and feel comfortable with me. As well, since I am young, I think listeners think I am their equal. I think they think of me as their friend. Haha. But my young age is also my worst quality. Even when I try to relate to the stories of the listeners, I sometimes feel like I dont have enough life experience. Im learning from them. Should I call it indirect experience? 

**Q: Since youre a popular idol, when related issues come up, isnt it difficult to sit before the microphone?**

A: At times like that, I think of Sunny DJ as someone who is not a member of SNSD. If I use this time to discuss my issues or defend myself, I would feel like I was harassing the listeners. I think its only right to discuss stories like that in my own space. 

**Q: Then what does FM Date mean to Sunny?**

A: FM Date is school. Like how you go to school to learn every day, after I do a broadcast, there is always something I can take away. Truthfully, its up to the student how much they learn from a good teacher, right? I think how much you learn through radio is up to the DJ. What is my grade? Ahahahaha. I dont know. Even when I was attending school, my grades were always up and down? So I dont have a sense of what my radio grade would be. Hehe. 

**Q: Is there a memorable listener?**

A: Last year at Christmas, there is a couple who was born because of FM Date. The man and the woman both had feelings but couldnt progress but the man said he listened to this show so the woman wondered What kind of a broadcast is it? and started listening. So she ended up sending in a story and the content was, I see you as a man. Should we date?. And the man heard the story. He sent a message saying Okay! to the homepage. We ended up connecting both of them over the phone as a Christmas special so they could confirm each others heart. Wow~ I was really jealous. 

**Q: Is there a guest youd really like to have on the show?** 

A: Cools Lee Jae-Hoon oppa! Even before he became popular again with MBCs Infinitely Challenge-ToToGa, I said I really wanted to invite him as a guest. He hasnt come on the show yet. Hnnng~ Truthfully, in the early days of SNSD activities, we overlapped with Cools activity and Lee Jae-Hoon oppa was holding a placard with my name written on it. It was so memorable for me that whenever I listened to Cools music, I kept thinking of that moment, you know? He is so good at singing too. I would like him to come on FM Date now! 

**Q: FM Date is now 23 years old. Is there a quality and strategy unique to Sunny that is different from all of the previous DJs?**

A: (Jang Soo-Yeon PD) I will answer this question.  Sunny really enjoys meeting people and she also truly receives a lot of love back from people, you know? Her network is really wide and it transcends generations. You can tell because she has had elders like Park Geun-Hyung and Jun In-Kwon as radio guests. As well, she is intuitively very good at talking about music. Even if its your first time listening to a song, she explains it so well that you can understand it right away. Compared to all of the DJs before her, this is a strength that only Sunny as shown. 

**Q: If FM Date was a song, which one would it be?**

A: Deulgukhwas Everyday with You! Its not about making a single day special or making it crazy fun but I hope listeners can find comfort in the daily routine words of SoonD. It aligns with the direction and lyrics that FM Date pursues as well. 

**[Who is DJ Sunny?]** She debuted in 2007 as girl group SNSD. They took the spot of South Koreas best girl group with hits like Into the New World, Run Devil Run, Tell Me Your Wish and Gee. Last year, she took the DJ seat of FM Date in May and in the same year, she received accolades for her skills by taking home the MBC Entertainment Award for Best Radio Newcomer.

Gook-Ju: I've never dated a celebrity before. Truthfully, I would like to date a celebrity. What about you guys... Honestly, while you've been famous, have you dated another celebrity? 

Sunny: Yes, I have. 

Gook-Ju: Is it more comfortable?

Sunny: Just because they're a celebrity, it wasn't any more or less comfortable. 

Gook-Ju: Is it just people are people?

Sunny: Person by person. 

Gook-Ju: How do you date when you're both busy?

Sunny: It's messenger love, messenger person, messenger dating. 

Gook-Ju: I want to laugh cry. 

Nana: Does love grow that way? Even if you don't see each other. 

Sunny: Love doesn't grow that way. So it doesn't turn into true love.

Gook-Ju: What's the longest you've dated someone?

Sunny: I've never passed the 1 year mark.

Nana: Oh, really?! You see people for such a short period of time. 

Sunny: I've never dated for longer than a year. Really. 

Nana: You're cute~

Sunny: You're saying an unni is cute?

Nana: When I date someone, I don't start easily and I don't end easily either so there hasn't been that many.

Gook-Ju: How many so far then?

Nana: Since I was young? Since I was in elementary school?

Gook-Ju: Then, let's do since high school! 

Nana: Since high school? Less than five...

Gook-Ju: Then of those guys, how long was the longest relationship?

Nana: Mmmm... 2 years...

Gook-Ju: Oh, you dated them for a long time!

Sunny: Were they a celebrity?

Nana: Celebrity...

Sunny: You dated SO quietly~

Nana: (shrieks)


**On Dating Secretively** 

Sunny: Do you live alone?

Nana: I live in a dorm.

Sunny: You live in a dorm? Then, you really have no place to date! 

Nana: I go on dates in cars. Sometimes we watch movies. 

Gook-Ju: You don't get caught? Well, I guess for you, if you cover your face, it works but I'm so big. 

Sunny: No, that's not true. If you see (Nana) walk, you can tell she's a celebrity. Even if she wore a hat, you can tell she is a celebrity by her jawline. 

Gook-Ju: Do you wear masks and sunglasses?

Sunny: Then, it's even funnier. People can tell you're an undercover celebrity.

Nana: That's right. If you cover everything up, you stand out more. But you also can't not hide.

Sunny: Exactly.

Nana: Definitely for two celebrities, going out in public is a trap. It's hard to eat out, so you're limited to home, in cars, or a very empty movie theatre. Even for movie theatres, it's not anywhere close but somewhere far. 

Sunny: Where's the place where there's no people? Was it in Yongsan? I've heard there's not a lot of people there.

Nana: I've seen a celebrity like this at a movie theatre. Two of them, from beginning to end, wore a hat. 

Sunny: While they were watching?

Nana: Yeah. So I thought, ""They're 100% celebrities"". 

Sunny: One time, I went with a girl friend to the movies, and in front of me was a very famous male celebrity who came with a woman. And on purpose, they came in after the movie started so they could come in when it was dark. You know how the movie screen is bright? Instead of the dark, his face was getting hit straight on by the lights and it was like there was a spotlight on him. And right behind him, the woman came in as if she was guilty of a crime. She was holding him like this and came in behind him.

Nana: Ahhh, it's so sad.


**On Displays of Affection**

Sunny: When a guy and girl dates, skinship (affectionate touching) is not a weird thing?

Nana: There's nothing wrong with skinship between people who love each other. 

Sunny: My favourite type of skinship is... ssdam, ssdam (patting). 

Nana: Like this?

Gook-Ju: I like kiss kiss. 

Sunny: Where?

Gook-Ju: (points to lips) Kiss kiss~

Sunny: Kissing on the lips?

Gook-Ju: Your eyes meet and then kissing.

Sunny: Like this?

Nana: I like it all. I like everything.


**On Memorable Gifts**

Nana: Sunny, what's the memorable gift you've received from a guy?

Sunny: I really like puzzles. He drew everything meaningful to me and made a puzzle with it. To match my birthday on May 15th, (5/15), he made a 515 piece puzzle and sent it to me. The important thing is we ended things badly so I had closed my heart to him and on my birthday, he sent me the gift. Because of that, I had second thoughts. 

Gook-Ju: Did you end up dating him again?

Sunny: No, just thoughts... seriously... 


**On Holding Onto Someone**

Gook-Ju: Have you ever held onto someone? To keep them from leaving?

Nana: I have, I have!

Sunny: I think I have too. 

Gook-Ju: Did the person stay because you held on?

Nana: Yup.

Sunny: No. 

Gook-Ju: I couldn't make them stay either.

Sunny: One time... This was the person that I mistakenly thought was my first love. When we broke up, I held on and we talked. In the last moment, I held his wrist - really - and said, ""Wait. I'll ask for the last time. Can't we not break up?"" And he didn't say anything... He just closed his eyes and stood still. And in that moment, I knew that he wanted to say no but he couldn't. I had to let go of his hand and just said, ""Okay. I'm sorry.""",11,41
