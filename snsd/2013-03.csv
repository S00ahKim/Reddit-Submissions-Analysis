We're based in the same country but I don't think there's much that I can do... Emailed her for now and hope it was an honest mistake but if not I'll be really upset because it's really poorly made. It's pretty much a logo (poorly) **hot glued** onto the cap with the signature at the side. Pretty depressing. =(

Here are the first three hoodie offerings:

[Beyond 9 Hoodie - All Colors (see description)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125201198/beyond-9-girls-generation-snsd-big-bang)

[SNSD IGaB Member Emblems (see description for instructions on choosing the member you want)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125200759/girls-generation-snsd-member-emblem?ref=v1_other_2)

[SNSD Heart Logo Hoodie](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125250588/girls-generation-snsd-heart-logo-hoodie)

We also added a crew neck sweatshirt for the Heart Logo, similar to the ones worn on the Music Bank performance.

[SNSD Heart Logo Crew Neck Sweatshirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125249674/girls-generation-snsd-heart-logo-crew)

The coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** is still active for you guys, so use it to get **15% off all orders!**

One important note about the discontinuation of the member emblem shirts:

We are going to do away with the option to include the ""I Got A Boy"" script text on the shirts on March 17. If you want a shirt with the text on it, order asap to get that style.

We will keep the member emblems without the script going a little longer since we now have hoodies for them.

As always, if you have questions/suggestions/requests, let me know and we will do our best to accomodate everyone. 

Thanks to those of you who have posted pics of their KpopGear, you guys are awesome! If you buy an item from us and like it, post a pic and let us know what you think!",33,28

Apologies for another post so quickly after my last update, but I just wanted to answer a couple common questions I've received and announce a couple more popular designs that we now offer in hoodies:

[SNSD Diamond Logo Hoodie](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125330723/girls-generation-snsd-diamond-logo)

[SNSD GG Crown Logo Hoodie](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125335714/girls-generation-snsd-crown-first-album?ref=v1_other_1)

Now to a few of your questions:

**Q: Do you offer tank tops?**

A: Yes, we can get tank tops for any of the designs that we offer. The price is the same as a regular t-shirt, and color options are limited (white, black, grey, blue, red only). 

If you would like to order a tank top, please either message me or just purchase the t-shirt version of the item you want and list in the notes at checkout that you want a tank top.

**Q: Can you get zip-up hoodies?**

A: On the designs we currently offer, we will not be doing zip-ups. We are working on specific designs that will work for zip-up styles, and I think you'll all like them a lot.

**Q: When will the SNSD I Got A Boy member emblem shirts be discontinued?**

A: The ones with the script ""I Got a Boy"" text will be finished March 17, while the ones without the text (by far the more popular of the two styles) will stick around until March 31, or a little longer if a large volume of orders are still coming in.

**Q: How long will the SNSDREDDIT 15% coupon code** be active?

A: As long as you guys are using it! It's the least I can do, since r/snsd has been so instrumental in the building of our store. You guys rule.

**Q: What is the fit like on the shirts/hoodies?**

A: There is a size chart on every listing, but I would say the shirts are a slimmer, athletic fit, while hoodies are more of a traditional fit. I wear a medium in regular shirts and medium in KpopGear shirts, but my KpopGear shirts fit a little tighter, especially through the body.

Hopefully that helps with some of your questions, but remember you can always pm me or leave a comment if you have any more! I'm always glued to my phone/Reddit, so I should be able to respond quickly.

Thanks again for everything!

i got exposed to the members as i look for more of her. i started listening to their songs, and i watched their variety shows. i found them to be very entertaining, so i became a fan. i discovered that all of them are just as equally as awesome as seo, and they have so many positive qualities that i started to look up to all of them.

how about you? what turned you into a sone?",34,28

Some of you have messaged us about possibly doing another one, and it's something I've been planning to do for awhile, but never got the time to do so. Now is that time! :D

The mods and I have been messaging back and forth to come up with more questions than last time, so prepare for a longer census :P. I know that I can't possibly cover everything you guys like or your preferences but I tried to keep them as common as possible.

With that said, GO GO GO and click the link below! It'll be up for a week or until we stop getting responses!

During the first week after first hearing about SNSD, I spent almost all of the time I was awake diving into the fandom and learning all that I could about the girls (to be fair, I was on Spring Break, so I didn't have much else to do).  Since this was 2012, I had almost 5 years worth of material to sift through: music videos, variety shows, live performances, interviews, etc.  It was a whole new world for me, completely foreign territory. I loved the rush I got from discovering this entirely new culture I knew nothing about beforehand, and spent as much time as I could trying to familiarize myself with the ins and outs of not just SONEhood but also K-Pop fandom.  That was very easy to do once I found you guys here at /r/snsd.

Anyway, looking back after a year, I realize how much my attitude has changed since that first week.  No longer do I consider myself an SNSD newbie, but one of the veterans who has been around the block.  I've seen an SMTown tour come and go, a Korean comeback and album, a Japanese album, a sub-group debut, etc.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that SONEhood has become a routine for me, to the point that it has almost become dull.  I'm not saying that I don't still love everything about the girls or the fandom.  I think of it like I've left the ""honeymoon period"" in a relationship.

So, /r/snsd, I've told you my story, so now it's your turn.  How do you feel looking back on your past as a SONE compared to how you feel now?  Is it a good or bad change in your opinion?",12,15

---

After a week of responses (a total of **1072** results), here are our results. In perspective we had 540 responses last year, and we nearly doubled that this year, so that's cool :D.

Now, on to the results!

---

###Gender: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/YdCOGMC.png)

Male or female? Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can all guess what the majority of us are :P. Out of the 1,072 responses, **949** are male, a whopping 89%. This is reddit after all, but a fun fact, a majority of SONEs (global) are female (soshified, the largest English website for SONEs are mostly female). Just like last year, **WHAT UP DUDES**.

Also, how you doin' 11%? ;)

---

###Age: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/M7ZBtvm.png)

881 of our responses are between the ages of 16 - 25, coinciding with the typical reddit demographic. Interesting find, out of the responses, two people are below the age of 10 and 6 people are over the age of 40.

---

###Race / Ethnicity: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/ukiiwl3.png)

Most of us here are either Caucasian or Asian, just like last year. Though I am curious as to how many of you are of mixed ethnicity and answered the 'other' option. Maybe I should add 'mixed' for our next census.

---

###Location: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/OXoDyck.png)

52% of the responses live in the US. Canada and Europe right behind at 15% and 16%.

---

###Favorite SNSD Member: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/agBqSWW.png)

Kid Leader continues her domination of this subreddit, with a huge 31% of you voting her as your favorite member (327 to be exact, double of our second place finisher in Sunny). We have 4 members with a 100 or more votes and it's no surprise really, especially if you pay attention to the amount of content that is posted of each of those members. I found it interesting that Yoona (seen as one of the most popular of the girls, especially in SK) had only 71 votes. Surprisingly low, IMO. And Hyoyeon received the least amount of votes with only 43 :( HYOHUNNIES WHERE YOU AT?

---

###Fav. Promoted SNSD Song: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/l1l3LAL.png)

If some of you were confused as to why these songs were chosen, these are songs they promoted and released (performed on shows, charted for multiple weeks on music charts). 'Genie' once again receives the most votes, showing that even after 4 years, that song continues to be the most popular outside of SK. 'Gee' comes in 2nd place and newly released 'I Got a Boy' comes in 3rd.

---

###Fav. SNSD Ballad: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/8qDcLlx.png)

I love SNSD ballads, so I thought I should ask you guys what your favorite ones are :P. 'Time Machine' comes in first, at 15%. The responses are really close and quite a few of you couldn't choose. Surprisingly, 'Lost in Love' did really well, coming in at 3rd place. It's my favorite song from their newest album and I added it on a whim. Awesome that a lot of you think it's great song as well :D

---

###Fav. KR Music Video: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/wvRykA8.png)

Essentially the same results as our favorite songs questions, with the only difference being the order. 'I Got a Boy' comes in first with it's awesome over the top MV.

---

###Fav. JP Music Video: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/JmWISGa.png)

Mr. Taxi, Taxi, Taxi~ comes in first. Paparazzi comes in as a close second, followed by Flower Power. Out of all the Japanese versions of original Korean songs, 'Oh!' placed the highest.

---

###Fav. SNSD Full Album: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/ovepufR.png)

Last year the most voted album was their first Japanese release. This year Soshi's 2nd full album, 'Oh!' placed in first place. 'I Got a Boy' continues to receive love, coming in at 2nd place.

---

###Fav. SNSD Mini-Album: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/39qEm1e.png)

TaeTiSeo's debut mini-album comes in first place, receiving 34% of your votes. Well deserved, that album was fantastic, IMO.

---

###How long have you been a SONE?: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/8MBIdcT.png)

A majority of you are very recent SONEs, becoming fans in the last two years (2011-2012). 23% of you became fans in late 2011, with the release of 'The Boys'. I'm wondering if you guys became fans because of the English version or maybe their appearances in US media. 4% of you have been fans since debut, some OG SONEs in here.

---

###Have you seen the girls live?: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/YsysWR3.png)

Most of us did have not seen the girls live (86%). To those of you have seen the girls live, you guys answered 'Other' at the most with 43%. Of course by 'live' I meant actual performances, I'm assuming you guys that answered 'Other' have seen them 'in person'? If not, to those of you who said other, where have you seen them?

---

###SNSD merchandise &amp; Discovery: [Results](http://i.imgur.com/PefYjnT.png)

A lot of you have not bought any SNSD related material but give it some time, you'll end up buying some :P. Most of us have bought albums (digital or physical).

A majority of you (35%) discovered the girls by randomly stumbling upon one of their music videos.",84,113

This thing is so hard to find. Most of the sites that advertised it linked to a Daum link that has long gone, and there are virtually no mirrors available. It's so hard to find a working copy anywhere. I found one, but it gloriously failed. 

Being the smart man that I am, I deleted the installer I had after I had installed it (mistake of the year so far).

If anyone has the high quality version of the screensaver for Mac I would be a very happy person.

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (Downvotes will not be counted)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Jessica** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.

When he came home tonight, i told him that i had just finished listening to the snsd song that makes me think of him most. He said, ""oh, yeah?"" And i said, ""oh yeah!"" 
He then replied, a la ""gee"", ""oh yeah yeah yeah!""
Someone give this man some Reddit gold in support of our angels! Even a month would be appreciated. I would do it, but i want him to see how supportive and awesome our community here is. pm me for his username if you can help out to help make a sone of my hubby yet! Thanks everyone!
