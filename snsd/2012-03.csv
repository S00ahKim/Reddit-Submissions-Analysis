My only beef with the idea that they underwent plastic surgery, is the recovery time.

From the limited research I've done, it seems like most swelling goes down within a week, although bruising, redness, and other physical signs become less noticeable they are still prevalent. With a full recovery taking roughly 1 month to achieve 100% results from the surgery.

So, unless the members get a shitload of work done during their brief vacation period, which in my opinion would be pretty fucking obvious, when are they getting these surgeries? 


Also, it seems most people draw their evidence from pictures released by the media, not from videos or non-professional photos, but the issue with these photos is that they are all altered (A common practice among all celebrities).

Obviously, lesser cosmetic surgeries could be performed, but I've heard accusations of chin surgery, which involves like shaving down the bone. I would imagine the recovery period for this is pretty intense, what do you guys think? I'm very interested!




**Edit: Taken from a cosmetic surgeons website, the recovery time for Chin Reduction surgery:**

&gt;What is the recovery time from Chin Reduction / Augmentation surgery?

&gt;Most people are able to go back to work within a week of surgery. However your surgeon may suggest you take 1-2 weeks off work. A soft diet is recommended for about a week and strenuous activities should be avoided for up to 2 weeks. Any situation which might involve facial contact should be avoided for up to 6 weeks.",18,12

I feel as though The Boys is not representative of all the talent that SNSD has to offer. Does anyone know or have an idea as to why they chose to debut with The Boys instead of a different song, like Gee or Run Devil Run?

On another note, do you guys think their choice was a good one? Why or why not?

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I personally don't like The Boys because I think it's a little tacky (especially when they yell out ""GIRLS GENERATION MAKES YOU FEEL THE HEAT"") and I think they should have chosen Run Devil Run (especially since they did a much better version than Ke$ha did). I think it would have appealed to audiences in the US more.",32,8

Hello, I've been saving SNSD gifs for a while and I've collected a fair amount, in the recent months I've began to create an online collection of my favorite gifs. I started uploading the gifs on Photobucket but due to image size restrictions, I've finally decided to switch to a new image hosting website, minus, that didn't restrict my upload sizes. After a few nights of uploading I've successfully transferred over 5000+ gif images (and some pictures that were in my collection). I will be updating these albums regularly, whenever I find new gifs that I like.


------------


Each each album can only hold 300 images so I split my online collection into parts (300 gifs in each part with the exception of the newest part):

Since it is hard to upload all 1056 wallpapers anywhere (I tried Minus and failed three times) and Imgur. I decided to .rar them and then split them up into 200MB chunks then uploaded to mediafire.

[MediaFire Link](http://www.mediafire.com/?7pskn4i8waes301,hmbc3k8tinuwfz0,s8wcjah98swsllq,4gl7of3508fou8w)


Download all 4 of the parts (735MB total) then download [HJSplit](http://www.hjsplit.org/). when you have done that open HJSplit, then click join. Once that is done click Input File and go to the path you saved the four parts then click the first one. Put the output file to where you want the completed file to be saved. Then use a unrar software such as 7Zip, ot WinRar etc to extract all the files open. This is the best way I could have thought of as its a lot of files and after having problems with Minus and Imgur this was the only method that seemed like it wanted to work. 

I used a Dupe locator to try and detect any double wallpapers so hopefully there wont be many duplicates, but there will be some somewhere.

If you have any questions or want to try and upload them yourself somewhere making it more assessable please do!

EDIT: All of these are 720 minimum, with the majority being 1080 or 1200",22,84

I'm somewhat worried, as I've just started listening to kpop around the new year I've done a little research on the groups to get to know them better. During this foray into the vast world of kpopery, I've watched shows, listened to the music, and read some news. But what has me most concerned recently is this constant bothersome thought that I'm supporting an industry that treats its employee's unfairly. The first video that sparked this idea is a video of Sunny from SNSD fainting on stage, then I saw one with T-ara's Hyomin, Kystal of f(x), and Hyuna of 4minute. Now, perhaps if it was just a random one off occurence of Kpop idols succumbing to exhaustion I wouldn't worry, but it's not that, its kpop idols by the dozens dropping like flies, on stage in front of a huge audience.

With a little research I became aware of how grave the situation is, kpop idols are basically exploited more or less, worked extremely hard, and given very little leeway. Their contracts are shackles essentially, and their manager (at least in the one contract that was publicly released by SM, the contract of DBSK) had absolute say and had unilateral decision making ability, as made stated in the contract. The contract lengths are also very long, 13 years originally, after the lawsuit by DBSK, they are limited to 7 years except in the case of a band performing oversees which makes the longest contract 10 years. This may seem of little consequence, but when you realize these contract laws where just enforced a little over 1 year ago, kpop's move to capture the Japanese audience also came with added benefits of a 3 year contract extension.

P.S. I still like KPop, It just sucks learning about this stuff.

PPS, When I first started listening to kpop, I didn't understand the trainee concept. It made more sense to me, if I owned a entertainment company, to hire people who already have talent andthe looks and the age, as it is done in the American music industry (with a few exceptions). When I actually started to think about it though, it really makes sense from a financial point of view. If you sign someone when they already have talent, they are aware what they bring to the table and command a higher salary. If you hire younger kids (11-14 years old) they haven't reached the peak of their abilities, and you can sign them into a 10 year long contract at that point and lock them into some really terrible salary / profit distribution.

Anyone have any thoughts? I'm using somewhat dated information (2009-2011), I couldn't really find anything else, if anyone has some juicy insider knowledge I'd really like to know. But for now, I'm going back to watching Invincible Youth 2.

The photobook itself is really big, bigger than I expected it to be. It also came with a calender, a mousemat and a few photo's. http://minus.com/mWLVj5VZM#1f (Link to some pic's I took). Not going to lie, it was pretty expensive (especially the shiping) but worth it! 

 At first I was a little worried that I could've gotten scammed because it took a little longer than usual and I wasn't sure if I could trust it because it didn't go trough e-bay or anything like that, just plain pay-pal. The first time I transfered money I got a refund within 3 days because I didnt pay the right price and also got help after asking why they refunded in the first place. Also around that time there were some rumors going around that a few SNSD fansites were scamming people, especially foreigners.

All in all it was a pretty good experience with my favorite fansite to begin with. I'm happy with my photobook and I encourage you to do the same, they are definitly worth the money plus most fansites explain how to send money and stuff pretty well for foreigners.",4,11

As i'm linking this right now, it has Taeyeon's name out front, singled out as the leader, then the rest of the girls listed as 'other members'.

A few weeks ago, Taeyeon wasn't even noted as the leader.

When i first got into SNSD(this was a while ago, so this is my best memory), they were listed with something like Tiffany, Jessica, and Taeyeon as lead singers, Sunny, Yoona, and Seohyun listed as back up singers, and Yuri, Hyoyeon and Sooyoung listed as dancers. I don't think i found out Taeyeon was supposed to be the 'leader' for a few months.

I'm assuming different fans with a strong bias are editing it regularly, changing the way the girls are listed to accentuate that fans favorite girls.",8,8

When I first saw Gee I remember wondering why Hyoyeon was in the group. She didn't really sing all that much and I knew her as ""that chick who just puts her hand up to her face a lot"". Now, she is one of my favourites, some of the best scenes in any of the shows I've seen of the girls are when Hyo gets to say whatever she wants, its always entertaining (I'm thinking of GGTS episode 6 or 7 specifically when she introduces herself as the ""cutie of SNSD"" or something and the face[s] she makes is hilarious).
