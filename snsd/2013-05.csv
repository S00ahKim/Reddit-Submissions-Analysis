1,2013-5-1,2013,5,1,11,1dgh34,First album show and tell time!,TouSaya,1367376196,"Hey there fellow sones, it's your first album show and tell time! Show and tell us about the first soshi album you have ever purchased/received. You can say anything about it, from what it is, where you got it, your favorite song in the album, and more! Let us know how your  dedication to the the girls began.

I'll start.
Here is the album: http://i.imgur.com/3SyMkJx.jpg
As you can all see this The Boys album. This is my first and currently only album that I own. I've only recently become a sone and before I was simply a huge Soshi enthusiast. I bought this album through my friend who was able to buy this for me in another city outside of my own. I really enjoy this album and my favorite songs would have to be Oscar or Trick. I believe this album was worth the money and I am currently trying to save up in order to purchase more albums to support our girls. If anyone has any recommendations for my next album it would be greatly appreciated :D

Edit: I also believe that the photocards are really cool as well C:",36,17

My story: even with my gf of 5 years now, she still can't stand the girls for the sole reason that I'm a huge fan. It's pretty sad, but I can't force her to like what I like so I just keep my fandom pretty much to myself and away from her.

If you order more items on the same purchase the discount will apply to those as well. Minimum purchase is $20 (regular price, before coupons), so if you don't like the baseball shirts but have been waiting to order something else, this is your chance to get the biggest discount I've offered yet.

Also, for those of you who don't like the 3/4 sleeves or the raglan/baseball shirt style, we are offering the same prints on regular t-shirts. Please message me and I will provide you a custom link for the t-shirt version, which has several color options.

As always, let me know if you have any questions. Here's hoping that Fany's pitch turns out better than [Jessica's!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS0g9kohiS4) Thanks!

I was going to cut it off at 24 hours, but I decided to extend the sale until 12:00 am EST (12 hours from now). This will give anyone who didn't see the post yesterday a chance to get the deal too.

Remember, use coupon code **PITCHERHWANG** at checkout to get the discount, and it applies to *anything* in the store, so long as your total is greater than $20 before the discount.

Message me if you have questions! Thanks!

I was wondering if people would like to see the upvote icon changed to a nice Soshi pink, so it could be a real pink ocean.

It would seem appropriate as its a sign of our support for the girls.

From some googling it would seem possible for the mods to change the colour without too much effort, but I'm not 100% sure.

325,2013-5-16,2013,5,16,6,1eequq,A great little fanaccount of Jessica's stay in Hong Kong,SirToki,1368653521,"Gotta start blogging about how I met Jessica Jung of Girls Generation here in Hong Kong. Two days guys, Ive met her for two days and It was so overwhelming. Shes so kind, nice and most of all, beautiful. I love how she entertained her fans and Im really happy that I got to meet her and found out how nice she is. 

May 13, My friend and I waited for Sica at the airport since the time of our arrival is quite the same as hers (they said), so we tried to wait but since she didnt arrive yet, we decided to just eat first. After hours we decided to just pass by the venue instead. When we arrived, there were a lot of people waiting for Sica outside. I wasnt able to go near the venue since there were a lot of people but when Sica arrived a few hours later, my friend and I tried to squeeze in the crowd. We took a few photos and we were screaming her name and she gave so much fanservice to the crowd. I love how she actually went out of the glass just so she could give us kisses and waves. Also, when she went to stairs, she actually stayed for a bit at the middle of the staircase just to give fanservice. Shes really kind. 

After, my friend and I decided to go back to the hotel and to my surprise, some fans who were there said that Sica also will be staying in that hotel and I was really excited. We had dinner and we stayed at the lobby for hours. While waiting, I decided to scan my I Got A Boy album and looked for Sicas page, I also wrote some post-it questions for her. 

A few fans left but after minutes of waiting, Sica arrived at the hotel. My friend and I were literally shaking because we really didnt expect her to stay in that same hotel. We were fangirling secretly at the side and she looked at us and she saw my I Got A Boy album and smiled, she also said Do you want me to sign that? and I literally froze and she smiled Dont be shy. I took a step forward and the guards were asking me not to stay close but she motioned for us to come to her and there, she signed the album and smiled again. I told her how gorgeous she is and I told her that Im starting to fall for her and shes answered me Please keep on supporting Girls Generation, okay? And smiled again.

I love how she smiles at us and shes really kind. I dont know how many times Ive typed kind on this post but Im very much saying the truth that shes genuinely kind. 

May 12, My friend and I went at the lobby and we saw a few bodyguards who stayed a long the hallways and there we, again, saw Sica. We were so shy to pass by the area and there were only a few people staying at the lobby. I guess shes going somewhere because she was wearing something casual. I love how she dressed up casually but still, looking gorjess as ever. She looked at us again and smiled. She even greeted us and that was the time I asked her if she could answer some some post-it questions. At first, shes hesitating to answer but she told us about the questions and I gave her the post-its. We stayed near the table and there she read the questions.

JESSICA: Ive answered a lot of EXO related questions before. Please keep on supporting them. Those kids are very hard working.

This is what she said when she read the exo related questions I gave her. She also checked Taeyeon, Hyoyeon and Seohyuns names twice! Since Im an EXO fan too, I didnt slip the chance of asking Jessica. She also said that Suho is close to every SNSD member too.

She also laughed when she saw the PRINCESS SICA and she said that she loved it. Also, when I asked her about who among the members you would like to switch places/exchange lives with for a day (I gave her three choices - YOONA, SEOHYUN &amp; TIFFANY) she chuckled and said, I would want to try Joohyuns life. And she checked Seohyuns name.

My friend and I were really lucky to meet her twice and were really lucky that she was the first one to smile to us and told us that we can talk to her. Shes really friendly. I dont get why some people think that she isnt nice. Shes definitely one of the nicest SM artists Ive ever met in my life. 

Also, I asked her if we could take a picture but since she was in a hurry, she just told me next time and she looked really guilty because she pouted and she said shes a bit in a hurry, of course, I understood. But to my surprise, she actually opened her arms and hugged us (my friend and i). 

I really love her now. My friend and I cried for a minute when she waved goodbye, I guess she went to a mall or something because the woman next to her asked her if she wants to go shopping. 

Im so thankful because of that Jessica Jung moments we encountered. It was all unexpected and my Hong Kong stay was definitely worth it! Thank you so much Sica for making us happy! Youre beyond words. I cant wait to see you again when I visit Korea and I hope youll remember us.

The links are unaffected and everything from the related subreddits/websites remain the same.

Hopefully this makes things less cluttered for you guys :) Here's a [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/wiki/index).

It looks amazing for someone that plans on going to SK for a shor vacation or only for the concert.
Besides the ticket they take care of everything.. accomodation, transport, etc..
The prices didnt seem to outrageous too so I tought I should share with you guys.
Its only for Seoul, at least for now, but the trouble that saves you is well worth the price for someone that wants to go see the girls and get a tour backstage.

What are your opinions? Honestly I will only be able to do this stuff in a few years when I can actually pay for it but the fact that they actually make this for international fans its pretty amazing.",5,19

Now I'm wondering if it too late to watch the girls preform **Gee** or **Genie** and watch them live in their sexy Genie uniforms. Now it's all about **The Boys** and **I Got a Boy**.

Do you guys think they'll ever preform **Gee** or **Genie**? mm.. I miss the **Genie** era lol.

498,2013-5-22,2013,5,22,8,1esrsp,Message book to Seohyun open until 28th May!,arthurmauk,1369179966,"Hi guys, a new Seohyun fansite called Dear My Lover is sending a Message Book to Seohyun for her birthday, you can add your message here: http://dearmylover.dothome.co.kr/bbs/zboard.php?id=tosh

To add your message you do have to join but it's not difficult and I can walk you through the steps:

1) Click the ""Join"" button on the right-hand side. This will open up a pop-up window for you to register an account.

2) Fill in the registration form. ID is like your username and you can check it so that it's unique and you're not using anyone else's. Password is just password so create a new one and then confirm it to the right. Name is what will be displayed above your message so make sure you choose what you want to display! Birthday goes YYYY-MM-DD as you do in Asia. Feel free to untick the checkbox if you don't want your birthday to be public. Email is necessary but they don't send you a confirmation email or anything. Homepage and self-introduction are not necessary. Leave the bottom 2 tickboxes tick to confirm that you're happy submitting this information. Then click the left button at the bottom (not the Close lol) to submit your registration. If successful it should give you another pop-up window.

3) Now try logging in with the Login button on the right. Type in your username ""ID"" and password, then Confirm. Another pop-up box appears so just click OK. If you've successfully logged in then instead of login and join buttons on the right, you should see info, memo and logout buttons instead.

4) To write a message in Seohyun's message book, click the ""writeopen"" button in the middle of the page. That opens up a message box where you can write a message for Seohyun. When you're done, click the ThankU button to submit. On the next page, click the Move button and then relogin and Confirm. 

5) To check your message, open up the http://dearmylover.dothome.co.kr/bbs/zboard.php?id=tosh link again. It should be at the top since the messages are ordered in reverse chronological order. Assuming you're signed in, you can also reply, modify, or delete your own message. If you only see reply as the option then you're not logged in. Please don't spam guys, take care!

That's all for now, hope you guys have fun writing messages to Seohyun, and let me know if you guys need any help - I don't know any Korean either so I'm having to wade my way through this blindly. And kamsahamnida to the [Global Generation](http://www.global-snsd.com/) fansite, a SNSD European Portal which alerted me to this, you can check out their original newsletter here: http://www.global-snsd.com/en/newsletter/seohyun-birthday-2013",1,29

I saw Ji soo graduated high school this year and Kyungsan growing up in some pictures, but how about anything else?

And most importantly, I saw on google that Seohyun and Yonghwa live in the same apartment complex now, of course none of us can know for sure what's happening there but has there been much interaction between anyone who have been on the shows?

Ultimately I'm just really curious, I wanna know how Kyungsan and the Dangerous Boys are doing.",16,20

For one week, I'm running **23%** off everything in the store. Just use coupon code **YOONA23** at checkout!

If you have ordered before, thank you once again. If you've never ordered, you can view [my customer feedback](https://www.etsy.com/people/KpopGear/feedback?ref=pr_feedback) to be assured of the quality of the shirts and the smoothness of the transaction.

We also added a couple of items due to a ton of requests:

[Another Label Another Boy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/129114172/another-label-another-boy-snsd-girls?)

[Another Label Another Girl](https://www.etsy.com/listing/129114316/another-label-another-girl-snsd-girls?ref=v1_other_1) (for the guys, :)

We have a decent amount of selections in the store for other Kpop groups too.

Lastly, if you want tank tops, hoodies, crew neck sweatshirts, or larger sizes and you don't see them listed in the store, just message me here or on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear) and I can get a listing made for you. We can make anything on the site in a tank, hoodie, or crew neck.

As always, if you have any questions at all just let me know. Thanks!",1,26
