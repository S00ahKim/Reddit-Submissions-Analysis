What are your thoughts about ""I got a Boy""?

In all honesty, I really dislike it. I dislike the concept, hair styles, costumes, sets, change in sound, rapping, and etc. I know SNSD wanted to try something new and different and all but I feel like it was..too much of a sudden change. The song absolutely confused me, at times there it will be soft and cute, then all hardcore within 5 seconds. I preferably like SNSD better if they stuck to singing instead of rapping. The dance, however, looked pretty cool and nice. A little too many body waves if you ask me.  It looks like they're trying to be those American Girl Groups showing a lot of their skin and so. I mean I like the sudden change but..I dunno. Didn't expect to see SNSD this hardcore. 

Just a reminder, It's my opinion. Everyone have their opinions. Opinions doesn't equal to fact. So please don't hate on me! ",0,1

Here is the thread with the performances:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/15rtm5/girls_generation_romantic_fantasy_performances/


In the in betweens there seemed to be a lot of laughter and kind-hearted joking between all the girls, it was really nice to see them all sitting down together again, since it has been a while. All of the girls looked stunning, but Yuri looked beyond amazing. The years have definitely been kind to that woman. 

My only complaint was that during Run Devil Run they really seemed like they didn't want to be doing that song, and a minor complaint being the mic issues that ALWAYS happen, but they were generally good for this show. 

SNSD DAEBAK!

I went ahead and made an Etsy listing for each member, so you can check them out as follows:

**Taeyeon:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250491/girls-generation-snsd-taeyeon-emblem-t

**Yoona:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250676/girls-generation-snsd-yoona-emblem-t

**Yuri:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250759/girls-generation-snsd-yuri-emblem-t

**Tiffany:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119249087/girls-generation-snsd-tiffany-emblem-t

**Sunny:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250345/girls-generation-snsd-sunny-emblem-t

**Sooyoung:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250157/girls-generation-snsd-sooyoung-emblem-t

**Jessica:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119196319/girls-generation-snsd-jessica-emblem-t

**Seohyun:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/119250039/girls-generation-snsd-seohyun-emblem-t

On each listing there is a drop down for size and to choose whether you want the I Got A Boy script or not. I also listed in the description what other colors of shirts can be used (still with white ink) and instructions for if you want a different color than black. The general consensus on here was that black would be best, so that's what we went with for the main one.

I also included a coupon code for all of you to get 15% off the orders: **snsdreddit**

Please let me know if you have ANY questions or special requests, and I will make every effort to make it happen for you all. Thanks and sorry for the long post!",70,31

Then at 2:02 Tiffany says ""ayo stop let me put it down another way"" and they start singing from the girl's perspective, the girl ""who has a boy"". Then at 3:41, I think the girl is somehow angry maybe because the boy is not giving her attention, but then Jessica comes at 4:02 and says ""Don't stop, let's bring it back to 1:40"" in the song, and the girl is happy again.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;From my perspective, the song has multiple personality disorder. xP So, I think in the beginning they are talking as if they are other girls, like girls who see how this girl has changed so much for this guy. And when the song changes at 2:02, it changes perspective to the girl actually did change, and she is talking about how much she likes this guy. at 3:41 the girl is mad for some reason, but then at 1:40 they decide to forget why they are mad ad be happy about this boy again. (?) O.O

Another interpretation:


&gt;Before I begin, let us all take a moment to read a comment from a fellow Sone:

&gt;This is why many international fans will never experience the true beauty behind kpop. The main reason being the language barrier. The song is a conversation between the girls about a boy. That is why the song goes back and forth, you have to follow the flow of the music and lyrics. For those making fun of the song having 9 parts is overlooking that all the girls are participating in the conversation. Some use rap to express their opinions and others used other genres. Its a shame so many cant appreciate this powerful and flawless single from the girls. To be completely honest with you all, this is by far one of the best songs from SNSD. Its so fierce and daring. &gt;- Noltan via soshified

&gt;I Got A Boy was, to say the least, not what anyone expected. It was bold, it was daring and way out of the girls comfort zone but that does not make it bad. I have seen comment after comment, criticizing what they call a poor excuse for a song. There are those that say its not unique, some who say they are disappointed. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, right? To me, the song is unique and I dont find it to be a disappoint. The lyrics tell a story about the boy, with each girl telling it from their point of view. As Noltan stated, they are having a conversation with one another  which was the concept of the song from the start: girl talk. Why tell the story from one side, when you can tell it from all. How can you not appreciate the hard work and creativity these nine ladies, and their company, put into this song? Its something entirely new and when you realize the deeper meaning, its not nonsense at all. For instance, The Boys may not have made sense in English but, the korean lyrics showed something more powerful. Its amazing what you can find when you read between the lines. Now it may not seem to flow well to everyone, but the two background beats remain constant. (An instrumental would show that.) For everyone expecting something cute, why cant our girls shy away from that image? Theyre grown women and its time they show that they are capable of anything, that they wont just stick to the status quo. Besides, not all of their past released material has been cute. What I am trying to say is, give the song a chance. Youll see that theres more than meets the eye. That its genius in a way, and appreciate the hard work put into it more. If this does not change how you feel, then nothing will.",2,20

&gt;Sooyoung: Do you guys think 'mildang'/pushing and pulling is needed in a relationship?


&gt;Yuri: How are you supposed to do it, Yoona?


&gt;Taeyeon: How do you do mildang?


&gt;Yoona: Do you think I'd be here like this if I was good at it?


&gt;Sooyoung: This is what I'm curious about: is it better to be faithful at that moment and express your feelings? Or, do you limit yourself because 'mildang' is needed? Like the lyrics 'she changed from head to toe'


&gt;Seohyun: I think you get a little influence (from the other person), of something. For instance, if there is someone you like, you gain a similar taste/preference as them. Isn't that kind of the case for everyone?


&gt;Taeyeon: For me, rather than trying to fit their preference, I think I would want to nurture something of my own.


&gt;Yoona: Yeah, me too.


&gt;Taeyeon: I'm curious about this: pet names.


&gt;Yoona: What do you want to call them?


&gt;Taeyeon: Darling?


&gt;Yuri: Honey? Baby?


&gt;Taeyeon: Sugar?


&gt;Seohyun: My cupcake?


&gt;Yuri (I think?): What the heck?


&gt;Tiffany: Not cupcake, but my older sister calls me baby cake


&gt;Yoona: Ba-Ca


&gt;Hyoyeon: I don't like things like 'princess' and 'prince'.

&gt;Taeyeon: 'Prince' is in the song lyrics

&gt;Seohyun: I think princess is good

&gt;Hyoyeon: Imagine if you're outside and they go, ""Princess, come here"".

&gt;Yoona: You go out to eat, and he says, ""Princess, sit here.""

&gt;Seohyun: It's nice if they call you princess though. Pet names make my fingers curl

&gt;Taeyeon: It's in our song lyrics, too. You wrote it

&gt;Sooyoung: Jagiya (equivalent to like, 'honey').

&gt;Hyoyeon: Is it like, ""Jagiya, my love~"" (it's from an old comedy skit)

&gt;Sunny: When is that even from? 


---------------------


&gt;[[TRANS](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/kisjqb)] 

&gt;Taeyeon: Let's talk about ideal types.

&gt;Sooyoung: Ideal types?

&gt;Seohyun: I really didn't care about a person's looks, but I think I do now.

&gt;(Someone): That's natural

&gt;Hyoyeon: She's honest

&gt;Seohyun: First of all, their eyes have to be pretty. They have to be really clear, and ones that look like they're 
smiling eyes (not sure how to explain this)


&gt;Sooyoung: For me, they need to have pretty eyes, a great nose, and cute mouth.

&gt;Seohyun: What about guy types you don't like?

&gt;Sooyoung: Guys that try to spruce up. When they make one action, they're all like...

&gt;Seohyun: They're conscious of others

&gt;Taeyeon: Pretentious guys

&gt;Seohyun: What else?

&gt;Taeyeon: Young guys.

&gt;Sooyoung: I agree

&gt;Jessica/Yoona: Not their age

&gt;Tiffany: Their actions and personality

&gt;Taeyeon: Guys that don't like phone calls.

&gt;Yoona: But, they say guys normally aren't good at having long conversations on the phone


&gt;Hyoyeon: Why? Do they have difficulties holding [the phone] against their ear?


&gt;Sooyoung: A person that only sends text messages when I send them first.


&gt;Hyoyeon: I hate people who don't contact you

&gt;Tiffany: You need communication

&gt;Yoona: I also don't like someone who doesn't get jealous

&gt;Taeyeon: Someone who doesn't get jealous?

&gt;Yoona: I don't like when they're extremely jealous either, but to a certain extent

&gt;Sooyoung: They are jealous, they're just acting like they're not


&gt;Yoona: But they kind of show it. I want them to show that they're jealous, a little

&gt;Yuri: A little? But you don't like when it's too extreme?

&gt;Yoona: Yeah

&gt;Sooyoung: This is hard~

&gt;Yoona: Right? My eyes (the way she looks at things) have become more difficult

&gt;Sunny: It's going to be really hard trying to become Girls' Generation's boyfriend

&gt;Yoona: I think that's why we're like this right now

&gt;Sooyoung: That must be why 

---------------------

&gt;[[TRANS](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/kisoov)] 

&gt; Tiffany: Who wants to show something else (performance-wise)?

&gt;Hyoyeon: Like individual stages

&gt;Tiffany: Who has something [they want to show]?

&gt;Seohyun: Throw your hands up. Everyone does

&gt;Hyoyeon: Has everyone been preparing?

&gt;Seohyun: Everyone does

&gt;Hyoyeon: I can't sleep because of Seohyun

&gt;Seohyun: Why?

&gt;Hyoyeon: Am I allowed to say this? She plays guitar everyday

&gt;Seohyun: So you can't sleep?

&gt;Hyoyeon: Isn't it for the comeback show?

&gt;Seohyun: You're right

&gt;Hyoyeon: She's been practicing a lot. Yuri and I It's something that we haven't done before, right?

&gt;Yuri: It's not. The producer of our performer is Hyoyeon

&gt;Hyoyeon: What the heck

&gt;Yuri: I got cast by her

&gt;Tiffany: You're on a roll, Yuri

&gt;Sooyoung: Oh, Hyoyeon said she wanted to do it with you? What about me?

&gt;Hyoyeon: Sooyoung, please keep still until I ask for you. Sooyoung is doing it with, who else, Yoona and Sunny?

&gt;Sooyoung: You didn't call for me, so I decided to do what I want

&gt;Tiffany: It's a fresh balance

&gt;Jessica: I called for you, Sooyoung, but you said you didn't want to do it with me

&gt;Tiffany: Is this where we start feeling sorry

&gt;Sooyoung: Yoona, I called for you.

&gt;Yoona: That's right. You called for me, but it would work with just us two, so we added Sunny unnie.

&gt;Sooyoung: You aren't supposed to tell her that. Doesn't Tiffany have a solo stage, too?

&gt;Seohyun: What's it about?

&gt;Tiffany: Wanting to give my number to a guy that I've fallen in love with at first sight

&gt;Hyoyeon: Have you done that before?

&gt;Tiffany: No

&gt;Hyoyeon: Try giving your number (like the song), and then do it. 

---------------------

&gt;[[TRANS](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/kisvvg)] 

&gt;Yuri: Who do you think will get married first?

&gt;Tiffany: Married?

&gt;Taeyeon: Sooyoung.

&gt;Hyoyeon: Sooyoung for me, too.

&gt;Sooyoung: Why?

&gt;Taeyeon: To me, Sooyoung has the image of someone who would be devoted to her family. Seohyun also has the image of someone who would become a good wife.

&gt;Yoona: When do you all want to get married? What age? (not really trying to pinpoint who said what, but I think Hyoyeon/Tiffany/Yuri/Yoona said 30, Seohyun: 31, Sooyoung/Jessica: 20s)


&gt;Hyoyeon: Let's put everything into the first person who gets married

&gt;Sooyoung: But let's not try to get married first on purpose. Let's really make a 'gye' (a kind of private fund) group

&gt;Hyoyeon: I don't know... if Girls' Generation will still be around then

&gt;Sunny: I'll do Soshi, but I won't dance

&gt;Yuri: You're going to dress your child up in a style that you like, you know? For instance, Sooyoung would 
dress her child up in her own style, and when I got shopping, I would buy something that would suit Sooyoung's baby. 


---------------------

&gt;[[TRANS](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/kit1gm)]

&gt;Hyoyeon: Because we haven't been on stage for a while, I'm nervous. I'm getting nervous like a long time ago.


&gt;Seohyun: I want to hurry and show [the fans]


&gt;Hyoyeon: It's really different from what we've done thus far


&gt;Sooyoung: I think the feeling of wanting to show the fans a good appearance was really big (since fans have been waiting for so long). So that makes my heart race. ",9,27

However, I'm not sure what is included in this order, the page has little to no information. Since it's available through Prime, I'm assuming it's the whole album and such, but if it's not, please inform!",2,6

201,2013-1-4,2013,1,4,19,15y0sk,"If you could create a new album using any of SNSD's songs, which ones would you pick, which would be the title track, and what would be the concept?",[deleted],1357294745,"It's definitely a love-hate relationship with SM entertainment. We love the girls and what they do, but when new teasers and title songs drop, the album doesn't always reflect the same image. So if you could rearrange part of SNSD's discography, how would you do it?

I'd say it's okay to include Japanese releases too - more to choose from and they're awesome.

Here's mine:

**Tracklist:**  
1. TRICK (Title song)  
1. The Great Escape  
1. XYZ  
1. OSCAR  
1. Destiny  
1. Beautiful Stranger  
1. Look at Me  
1. Let It Rain  
1. You-a-holic  
1. Chocolate Love  
1. I'm a Diamond  
1. Wake Up  
1. BOOMERANG  
1. Run Devil Run  

A lot of us have probably imagined what it'd be like to have TRICK promoted, or at least performed. I think a magician concept would be a sight to see - cards, hats, wands, and lovely assistants would fit the girls well, in my opinion. The other songs add to the strong girl, strong soshi theme. The Japanese songs are more electronic and fierce in nature, in general. Let It Rain is the probably the closest this album would get to a ballad, yet it's still powerful. Chocolate Love and Run Devil Run are feminine, but not cutesy, and still strong. I always thought Wake Up was out of place on the Hoot mini-album, but it fits in with other songs of theirs, like Destiny, or more recently, XYZ.",0,1

I also wanted to say thank you to all of you for being so enthusiastic about this stuff! I just wanted to make some shirts for myself and a couple friends, but you guys all made it much cooler since we get to share with people all over the world.

If you have any questions/concerns/compliments/suggestions at all about them just let me know. I'm new at this, so we're looking for all the feedback I can get. 

We are still printing them and the coupon code (**SNSDReddit**) is still active for 15% off your total orders. We are introducing a bunch of new designs (SNSD and other groups, too) in the next week, so save the page and check back. 

Here's the store link one more time for any of you who want to order again or didn't get a chance to the first time.

As they don't have anything on the order status page detailing individual item availability I didn't know what was holding things up. I contacted them via email and coincidentally (or not) my order was shipped the same day and they responded to let me know why the order was delayed.

Which leads me to the point of my post, the anticipation. I know the order is on it's way to me and thanks to the tracking code I know how quickly it's coming which really builds my excitement levels but what really did it and gave me a reason to share with you all was the email confirming my order had shipped which included a photo of it packed. Just seeing it all packed up really hyped me up so I thought I'd share it.

Thanks once again for all of your purchases and help. The emblem shirts will continue to be available for at least a while longer, so if you haven't ordered one yet and want to (or want additional shirts) you can still get them.

I also added a bunch of new shirts based on a classic Beatles shirt design but featuring k-pop group member names. There are a bunch of different groups, including of course SNSD. I think they look pretty awesome.

Coupon code **snsdreddit** is still available for all of you for 15% off too since you guys have helped us kickstart this thing in a major way!

**Here's the SNSD version of the new design:** https://www.etsy.com/listing/120751696/girls-generation-snsd-group-member-names

**Here's the full store if you want to browse everything:** http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear

I'll say it again: I can't thank you all enough for helping turn a late night conversation with my buddy - about how it's tough to find quality, affordable k-pop shirts outside South Korea - into this online store. I've gotten great feedback from so many fellow fans and it makes me feel awesome. Hopefully you're enjoying wearing the shirts as much as we're enjoying making them. ",14,18

I only took it out of the plastic to take pictures, it is in mint condition and never worn. Here are pictures. http://imgur.com/a/VDWEK

This is what it looks like: http://imgur.com/a/QGKBk

Take note of the two holes above the wappen and I can confirm, 100% that it is sewn on (I spent a good 15 minutes trying to move the wappen or to look for a pin). On the back it is the Team Life tag and such, and it does have her signature on the side. It also came in the official plastic wrapping that was seen in the SM Lotte Pop-up Store.

As Dauthi kindly pointed out the differences in what was believed to be three versions in this post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/16w5f1/yay_ayo_gg/c7zz6vb

So I guess there may be a different version to the ones stated previously.

Read into it if you're interested, but it seems like they are getting exhausted performing this over and over again (and its getting boring watching it over and over again if they don't add some variation to each performance like they do with Dancing Queen. Plus I do remember one of their members (can't remember which) was injured a while ago. SNSD has made their comeback, but its been 4 weeks they've been doing this at both Inkigayo and now Music Bank;

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (Downvotes will not be counted)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Sooyoung** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.
