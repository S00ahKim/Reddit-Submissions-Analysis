It seems that we're gonna get a few new stuff with this latest release!

  * 2 new songs:
     * Mr Mr (Japanese)
     * Indestructible
  * 1 new video:
     * Everyday Love live from the Yokohama Arena @ 20141214
  * New solo interviews
  * 'Live History': footage from Girls Generations debut to the third Japan tour.
  * Making of 'The Best' (behind-the-scenes of album jacket photoshoot)

Another thing is that we could have a Blueray MV quality of:

  * Bad Girl
  * Galaxy Supernova Dance Version
  * Gee (Korean) ^(maybe, hopefully)

:D

I'm looking forward to this!!

^(Edit: Remove a MV I though was new but it turns out it was already part of another release)",12,15

June 30th - Single tickets go on sale.

Good news. SNSD will be playing one night at KCON. Your best bet is to wait it out and buy a single ticket for the night you want to go, or buy one Tier1 ticket and one Tier5 ticket on the 30th. **Of course, they will reveal which night they are performing before tickets go on sale, so I'll be posting that information as it becomes available.**

Here's the link for more info on prices and floor layout:

sone. you were really surprised and hurt because of me today, right.. im really sorry for making you feel feelings that you didnt have to, and the news that came about because i wasnt a bit more careful. i really wanted to apologize. im really sorry for hurting you..

Translation thanks to [@ch0sshi](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s26hr6)

**         ..     .          ..**

i think you feel disappointed, angry, hatred, heavy, dejected, and several other feelings.. i can take it all and i want to apologize. i don't know if it's just what i think, but [it's] because you liked, trusted, supported, and made that many efforts (i guess meaning towards her)

Translation thanks to [@ch0sshi](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s26hua)

**      ..           ..       **

No matter what I say now, it seems like it could be interpreted differently.. I'm not trying to explain for my faults but even if just for a day, I could make it so that you stop getting hurt, there's something that I want to say.. I absolutely do not have those kinds of intentions when I post majority of the things on my Instagram

Translation by [@Kymmie](http://twishort.com/r6Cfc)

**    .  .            ..**

""It must have fun while posting those obvious pictures on Instagram."" or ""Ridiculing the fans."" It seems there are many people who think like that so I really wanted to say something about it. I really did not have any of those intentions and that was not my objective..

Translation by [@Kymmie](http://twishort.com/x6Cfc)

Another translation by [Oniontaker](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s26hut) for the messages:

SONE, you were really taken aback and hurt today because of me, right..? I'm so sorry that I made you feel things that you didn't need to feel and the article today that happened because I wasn't more careful.. I really want to apologise. I'm sorry I hurt you.. really..

I think that you will be feeling great disappointment, anger, hate, frustration and emptiness and other emotions. I can accept all of that and I want to apologise. I don't know if it's just me thinking this but it means that you liked me that much, and supported me and worked hard that much for me..

I think no matter what I say, everyone will hear something different. [she might have had a typo that changes the meaning] I'm not trying to clarify/plead my case, but wanted to say something so that it might stop the hurting.. I never meant/planned it to be like that, about the instagram.

""She intentionally uploaded photos on instagram that were obvious. She was mocking the fans."" I wanted to say this because there seem to be a lot of people thinking that: I never meant it that way and that was never my objective..",110,80

410,2014-6-20,2014,6,20,2,28ke9y,About Taeyeon &amp; Baekhyun?....,Neoking,1403197919,"So, first off, I'm really happy for them. Taeyeon really needed someone to love and Baekhyun obviously had a huge crush on her. And I support her 100% as she is my bias and I just want her to be happy. 

But when I visited some forums, people started speculating that this might be a strategy by SM. At first I was like ""No way!"", but when I saw their reasons, it made me think a bit. 

1. SM stocks dropped from the lawsuit by Kris.

2. EXO is relatively new and SM is very strict with keeping the image
of a new band, so dating is always out of the question. They ease up after a while like with SNSD. So why would they confirm it immediately like this?

3. They might be using the hit BREAKING NEWS of the leader of the nation's girl group and a popular member of a popular boy band dating to divert attention off their lawsuit and focus it on this. 

4. In the future, as more information of Kris' lawsuit comes back, so much attention would be on this that the lawsuit wouldn't be focused on by fans. This lawsuit has caused trouble for SM and this could be a cover up to lessen the attention on it.  

What do you guys think of it? I'm still leaning more towards ""Yes, they're in love, that's it, let them be"", but this got me thinking. Either way, I'll keep it in the back of my mind. And again, I love Taeyeon and I'm super happy for her, I just want opinions on this.

In light of recent news it seems some Exo fans and even some Sone have left mean and harassing messages on Taeng's instagram. I've already left messages of support to her. Last thing I'd want is for her to remove her account.

I was thinking maybe r/snsd may have other ideas on how to either a) continue to show her we are on her side or b) silence/change the attitude of those harassing her. What other outlets do we have to send our support? Could we engage with Exo fansites and use their influence to stop fans from leaving hateful comments? I know some soshi fansites have been quick to encourage fans to be happy for Taeng. 

Being leader of Girls Generation is a privilege but it also comes with great pressure. [I think back to Taeyeon's response on Sketchbook when she said she feels lonely at times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWjadWRLW_g#t=17) Now she has someone to talk to and see during the lonely times. Funny the answer is what Heeyeol suggested too. I know most sane Sone realize if this makes Taeyeon happy its a good thing.

 dont take me wrong, this might even be the depression talking or the broken heart because of the news, but honestly, i feel hurted by taeyeon (not because shes dating or because its baekhyun), i know its ridiculous, i know its immature, but thats what i truly feel, i feel uneasy because of the so much claimed ""hints"" people have been talking about, and taeyeon denied, but they kind of seem true ""hints for each other"".
 the truth is that, im not writting this to attack taeyeon or her relationship with him. and im not writting this because i am proud of this relationship, at least not yet...
 the truth, is that im writting this because i know that are more people besides me that feel this way too... most of us feel proud, betraied, hurt, happy for her, most of us has way to many mixed feelings about this. but we need to realize that, it is useless to feel this way. right now, taeyeon is being the target of angry, hatefull and illogical exo fans. worst, she is probably in misery because her own fans feel cheated on by her! 
 we need to protect her now more than ever, even if we feel betraied, hurt...we have to stand up and fight. i realized that while i was laying in my room in the dark thinking about everything. maybe we are being selfish. maybe we are not. but that doesnt matter now. right now, we need to join forces and let them know that we support them (snsd) no matter what. NO MATTER WHAT. thats the unbreakable vow we've made when we became sones. even if it hurts a lot, it hurts them more, because we are not the ones who are between the sword and the wall, its them! and i know it will take some time to accept this, specially for the ones who either dont like baekhyun or insanely shipped other couple. but it doesnt matter. they are dating. thats it. we need to stay by their side, through the end of times. because thats what being a SONE is like.
i hope you realize this was just a way to express my feelings and to show that you are not the only one feeling sad, there are a lot of other sones feeling the same way, and thats why we have to stick together and help and comfort each other. thats the only way to support our girls to the fullest!

This is also the first time that SM has officially endorsed a intra-SM couple. I will only focus on Taeyeon's side of the relationship. She is after all, the older of the couple, i'd assume she makes all the decisions in this relationship. 


I urge you to at least read on, and understand and digest. [I understand this sub is majority Americans, Canada and Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/23duk5/results_of_our_2014_census/) And therefore your views may differ from the views of Sones living in Korea. You may have the urge to immediately downvote this, but for the sake of healthy discussion, i plead you hold your ratings.


The responses towards this has been varying, some elated for Taeyeon having unlocked herself from the shackles of her dating ban, while others felt furious and dejected from the sense of betrayal, supposedly from Taeyeon's actions, and everything in-between.


I will first generalize, and say that I think most here would feel elated for Taeyeon. I do understand. After all, Taeyeon is only human, and has wants, needs, and desires. Immediately it would be apparent to you that this dating ban is a serious degradation to one's living standards. After all, why should anyone be able to invade into her personal life, let alone control what she can do? These feelings are understandable, she is no longer young, she was lonely and supposedly in depression. Baekhyun came along, i do not know the details, but Taeyeon fell for his care and concern. All these should run up to an happy ending with a loving couple, shouldn't it?


Yes? But the Koreans saw this situation differently. Vastly differently. In fact so different, the conclusions they pull from this is that anger and dejectedness are the proper reactions to this situation.


Again, i plead that you hear me out.


You might immediately want to ask a grieving Korean, why is he so bitter? why does he not wish his idol he so liked, so cared for, so supported by, that he wishes her to lie in a depressed state, faking a smile everyday, as compared to a genuinely happy Taeyeon? This can only be said to be a shallow interpretation of this situation. 


As generalized in this [post](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.sg/2014/06/panninstiz-collection-of.html), The Koreans are not angered at her dating, nor with her choice of date, nor are they in despair that they were not chosen in favour of Baekhyun. I honestly believe anyone with a working brain, has already ejected the thought of actually having a chance with Taeyeon. The real problem lies within the criticism and belittling of fans. 


Answer me this, /r/SNSD, have you ever been into events supporting SNSD physically, literally queuing in the snow just to fill up a studio to show your idols you are there for them? Arranging complicated post-release album buying algorithms such as to keep the longevity of those albums on charts? Have you donated physical money to keep one of their multitudes of fansites afloat? Have you personally sent food bentos to filming sets, in order to gain the respect and get into the good books of directors and film crew, such that your idol may have a easier time on set?


Have you?


If that is not enough to show how crazy Sones are willing to express their dedication for SNSD, here is a little anecdote from me.


I have once attended an annual blood donation drive, organized by the local Sone gathering. This was inspired after SNSD's Love request show, and it has been extremely meaningful since. Mind you, the process itself was painful, the the feeling of being weak and tired for the rest of the week was a pain to bear in the modern stresses of my country. But all of that was meaningful; It was donated in the name of the one and only Kim Taeyeon. We even received a plaque that congratulates Kim Taeyeon of donating some 7 litres of blood for lifesaving.


It is hard to understand the feelings now held by the Koreans. Most have placed a large part of their lives into this, and for most of the masters of fansites, leaving SNSD is not an option. It is not farfetched to go beyond saying SNSD would not be here today without these Koreans. The dejectedness arises when [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/28knuw/trans_sunnys_instagram_photo_from_long_ago/) was leaked. It was prime evidence secret accounts exist. For all we know, SNSD have secret twitter accounts too. This would have been innocent, until Taeyeon started to upload cryptic images and hidden mushy nicknames for each other publicly. This would not have been a problem, if they kept it in their secret SNS, but surely Taeyeon would not be as silly as to post it publicly? Well, she did. Logically speculating why she would do something like comes up with 2 possibilities. One where she doesn't have, or wishes to be at the inconvenience of switching accounts everytime they wish to communicate. This is highly unlikely, as an class A idol, it would be highly unlike she would take such a risk as to keep her password always logged in, and kakao or Line would have better facilitated such needs. or, In the 2nd possibility, she enjoys the thrills of posting such messages, and having safely hinted time and time again of their relationship. Psychologist know all about this, and part of the adrenalin rush from death defying roller coaster rides. people are known to do this, well in roller coaster rides, who is to say Taeyeon isn't doing the same.


Regardless which situation lead her to do something like that, It is important to realize that nobody likes to be trapped between 2 lovers, and i can assure you its not a good feeling reading what is not meant for you, worse, interpreted as for you, but not. Some did not know this until the very end, which by then, was anger and sadness. Imagine sending something to Taeyeon, something you designed yourself, sweat and effort all put into having your idol appreciate it. She receives, and captions it with a ambiguous message. You accept its a response to your work, but finds out after some time that it isn't, instead for someone else, intentionally. You'd feel bitter too.


There were also posts regarding if TaeBaek was just a conspiracy to mislead people away from the Kris/yifan scandal. It would seem true, as Taeyeon is know to be a really smart leader. An open-roofed car, making out? Again, only 3 possibilities, That it is a conspiracy, where SM intentionally allowed the photographers to make a clear shot. or, Taeyeon isn't smart, and in the mist of hormones and lack of proper air conditioning, decided to open the roof. The last possibility i had difficulty grappling with; it puts doubt on everything Taeyeon's character and what she has claimed to be so far, that is that Taeyeon that is smart but has seem to have abandoned all willingness to hide their relationship and alongside the fate of SNSD.


Now ask yourself, is there anything SM is so afraid, such as to invent such madness to turn the eyes of silly netizens into forgetting Kris's scandals? Is Taeyeon stupid as to blatantly tell the world she is dating and risk the backlash?


Have you felt fighting a war where your generals have abandoned you? 


In Asian traditions, one is to remind oneself continuously of their origins, no matter how humble. It is meant to keep one grounded and upright for life. 


It is hard to imagine that one would have sacrificed so much for an idol, that one day the idol would use them as a stepping stone. Maybe it is how life works, maybe people need to be stung so as they may wake up from their fantasies. But regardless, it has happened, consequences will follow. 


Please, Think again before you type another mean comment about a person whom may not think them dating is smart thing to do now. Because they have reasons, and some are more thought-out than simple ideologies. 


As for Taeyeon's apology, you might not understand, but I believe Taeyeon finally understands the risky game she plays has backfired.


Oh and because you people can't seem to understand, such that i need to reemphasize, the reason i am writing this, is NOT because i am lonely, douchey and jealous. I am NOT saying Taeyeon should have chosen me instead. Neither am i saying them dating is forbidden. Instead, its the way they're doing things that is, just plain strange. ",54,0

Let's all go to Instagram and Twitter in force with messages of support for Taeyeon! Let's create and share support images and tags to strike back against the haters!

Here's [one](http://imgur.com/QDZOY6P) to start things off. Let's not stop there! Share yours and repost the ones others share to amplify our voice!

You may think your messages probably won't be seen in the flood, but don't let that keep you from showing your support. It takes everyone working together to drown out the haters.

In the fireworks business they say ""People only remember the finale."" Let's be sure there's a strong finale of support right now as this drama gets past it's peak so that the real fans are the ones who are remembered!

Taeyeon is hopefully taking a break from Instagram right now, but this isn't just about her. The other girls are certainly watching and dreading getting such drama themselves. Tag your favorite member in your Taeyeon support posts so they know the fans are still there and they can count on you in their time of need.

Let's do this.

Here's one of my favourite Soshi smiles: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HjIKFh78pyo/UhQ_Szpuz1I/AAAAAAAAKo0/sHLi_-0MUPU/s1600/130819+tiffany-at-incheon-airport-heading-to-indonesia-fantaken004.jpg It was taken by Tiffany fansite [Fanyholic](http://fanyholic.com/) on 130819 at Incheon Airport when she was on her way to Bali, Indonesia for a photoshoot, more pics here: http://www.smtownsnsd.com/2013/08/fantaken-pictures-130819-tiffany-at-incheon-airport-heading-to-bali-indonesia.html 

I thought Fanyholic did a great job of capturing her laughter here as she passed through the airport, maybe they brought a funny sign or pulled a goofy face or something, cos even the (other) manager was laughing! And doesn't that casual red sundress look perfect on her for the summer? \^^

After a couple of hours I decided it was time for a little cheering up, and nothing worked better than seeing this whole subreddit teeming with beautiful smiles.

Hello all. Recent events have inspired me to register and post on reddit. I hope my post can be seen as helpful and a thoughtful contribution to fellow fans. I know its a little late being a week later. But I think this could still be a good read. It is still on peoples minds from the look of things. 

Id like to introduce myself as a fellow taeyeon bias. I was thinking I cant be the only one trying to make sense of things. Finding that balance between wishful thinking and what is actual truth with your favorite girl. Taeyeon is the bias of most of the fanbase as I understand. So Im going to be talking from the taeyeon bias viewpoint. Where you like her and understand her a little better than the other members. The wishful thinking being that side of you that likes her. And then the obvious truth that is real world facts and such. 

Im from America and would actually prefer that they date openly. So please dont bash. Im not deluded into thinking I have any form of ownership over famous people who dont know or care about me. (I know these idols are very nice to their fans if your thinking about saying something like that)

I would prefer they date openly because then you get to see if you think they make a good couple or not. But with all the suspense they build up with the BS dating rules. Just seeing one guy makes things weird when it shouldnt.

Now for the main event. I want to be able to write this in as few words as possible. I apologize if Ive left anything out. But I think my point gets across.

Im excluding anything related to Instagram photos and the part of the fandom that is upset at taeyeon for simply dating. The betrayer talk and such are moot points. They pertain more to a fans own problems than anything taeyeon does. 

Now I would not write anything in the first place if something wasnt fishy. And this scandal is fishy. Taeyeon is caught on a date and confirmed to be in a romantic relationship with baekhyun. Now while the first thoughts we have about this feel the most important to us. They are also the most irrelevant. But Ill go over them fast cause noboby has ever mentioned them. 

Fuck she has a man. Lets see if hes good enough. If he fits the part I cant argue. Hes younger by 3 years at 22 years old. Hes 57. Not big with broad shoulders. Hes not like hugh jackman at all. This little boy does not fit taeyeons ideal type. WTF. Not only could I one shot this boy. But I could hurt him by accident if he got in my way.

Now I could go on and speculate as to why shes with this boy. Understanding her place in life at the moment and her reason for being with this kid, is one line of thinking that does have a plausible end to it. But its a moot point cause we'll never know.

The main point of interest is the way this relationship was revealed.

First of all SM confirmed the relationship 3 hours after the incident. It was at 2am in the morning. Which means that within a 3 hour time period. All of the crap of the taking of pictures. Sending pictures. Waking up people and deciding company media strategy. All before 5am in time for the daily news.? SM was ready and waiting. You dont even need to know if dispatch (the news people who report on scandals and relationships) is in cahoots with SM.

Second point is the pictures. Assuming youve seen the pictures Im going to post just a few.

This first one was with the reports of taeyeon being the one to pick up baekhyun at his home with exo. So I assume this is the place of residence of Exo.

http://fairytalebeyondreality.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/jdhs.jpg?w=593

this second picture says there are indeed fans outside idol groups places of residence. 

http://fairytalebeyondreality.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hjdhsdkjsfgsl.jpg?w=593

Even at late hours. Its also not hard to imagine that Dispatch itself is stationed at these sorts of places. Now idols know these things. Is this really something I have to prove? Fans and newspaper paparazzi hover around these venues. So if youre an idol. And we know idols car date all the time. They will know how to avoid these traps. 

Which brings in this third picture. 

http://fairytalebeyondreality.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/jdsadak.jpeg?w=593&amp;h=682

They drove 50 feet from the dorm to have a car date? What the actual fuck. If youre an idol secretly dating. You go out the back door. And meet a few blocks away to get in a car with your date. And you drive to a decent distance away location like the corner of an indoor or outdoor garage. Or a secluded lake front spot. In a construction site. Whatever floats your boat.

Now for the rest of the pictures that diverted our attention. Assuming youve seen them. Those pictures are easier to look up. Their seen hanging out in the car. Taeyeon actually looks like shes laughing into the camera in one picture. Like an embarrassed laugh. oops they see us. The photo where they were leaning in to kiss each other the top of the car was down. The top was up when they were hanging out. And then they take it down for the kissing scene. If I expect anyone to be a veteran at car dating here its taeyeon. Its one thing to make a mistake after so many years and forget something and the paparazzi get you. But this was such an amateur display of location and execution. Location in front of everybody. And take top down to show the kiss scene. 

So you have the amateur display. 50feet from the dorm. And 3 hours later SM confirms.

These are the thoughts Id like us to walk away from this with at the moment.

This relationship was revealed on purpose. That is the main point. It was deliberate. For all intensive purpose I can still only assume they are a legitimate couple. We can speculate on why they are a couple. We can speculate on why they revealed it. Whos decision was it to reveal it.  Drawing attention from the kris scandal seems the most plausible at the moment. But there are lots of theories out there. Anyway its still a sad week I guess lol. Yall made a good effort to make it smile week. Thank you for reading. 

CORRECTION: the photos of the yellow buses are different buses. And possibly different locations. So the 50 feet thing is a bust. Big mistake. Could argue other things but just gonna call this a bust for now. (at least i'm not pushing the ""Lee soo man lusts taeyeon"" theory. that theory is really tough to read)

QUESTION: how do i put lines through words for corrections? like i've seen elsewhere?",39,0

don't we all understand that this rumor in the first fucking place isn't true? not only is a member going to leave the group, but the person who made the rumor should feel fucking retarded.

second, there is no damn source for these rumors. do you actually think a member will go to a news reporter and say, ""Hey, one of us might leave snsd. just saying""? why the fuck would anyone do that?
and don't say ""it might be possible"" or some bullshit like that. there are so many people on twitter with many followers that go about saying these rumors?
