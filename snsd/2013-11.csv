I'm on NA server Nemesis but any leagues are free to join.

* [Express 999](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZ-kOW-Es0)

Just a little update on Jessica, this is what I understood from the social media: A security officer thought Jessica was a fan, who breached through security. He pushed her back, and Jessica hit her head on a rail. I am not 100% sure about this, maybe she fell from exhaustion + her cold, and the concert just got too much. 
Some say she is unconscious etc. Does anyone have up to date information? Is she okay now, or still unconscious? 
Let's hope and pray she will be alright again :)

[As translated from a Korean fan account]

My friends and I were waiting at a small shop near the departure door because there were a lot of fans who sat on the floor so we couldn't get to the very front.
The fans started practice singing and all, so we followed along then a couple minutes later they all started getting up because soshi arrived from the right side and we all sang Complete. The girls looked happy they even sang when they were putting their belogings in the trays.
Then a fan said we can actually go down to the escalator where the girls will go through because there are no barricades or gates around it. So the fan suddenly became our friend and led us, we took a short cut through an exit door and came out at some stairs and through another door. Next thing we know, we are at the lower floor. There were quite a lof fans already there and as we get in the crowd, soshi were making their way down the escalator. My friend wanted to have a better look. We screamed Yuri! Yuri! and started moving forward because everyone was doing so. We were focusing on Yuri and then we heard a fan shout ""HEY!!!"" and then a girl screamed. We heard a loud bang llike on a metal bar or something. Then everyone started screaming ""Jessica"" and we could hear the managers and staff calling each other. The other Soshi members ran towards us but we were pushed aside by a male staff wearing blue. Between other fans we could see Jessica's body on the ground and she didn't move for a couple of seconds. Then Yuri, Yoona and Sunny came from behind me and started calling Jessica. Sooyoung was really shocked she kept putting her hands on her mouth. After Jessica was lifted up by one of the manager, Yoona and Yuri started crying but no one said anything. 
We don't know where the person who pushed Jess because he was gone after the chaos. We saw Jess leaning towards theanager but she didn't even walk properly. After they were gone, we started asking people what happened and they said the security thought Jess was someone who was blocking the way..
They said some other things but in Chinese I can't understand.

Similar to what I did last year but instead of just cropping/re-sizing images, I'll turn them into wallpapers of your request!

I can also attempt clean ups of images. EG: From [this](http://i.imgur.com/53tnbKc.jpg) to [this.](http://i.imgur.com/86Tv9do.jpg)

Just **post a comment over at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSDrequest/comments/1qgejx/wallpaper_requests/) at /r/SNSDrequest** with the image you want and what you want done with it and i'll work on it as soon as I can.

* Dead Space
* Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box
* Crysis 2 Maximum Edition
* Medal of Honor
* Mirror's Edge
* Limbo courtesy of Fuguzors
* Swords &amp; Soldiers courtesy of Fuguzors


Since were getting a little anti fun around here, I intend to spice things up. Of course I'm not simply going to give my games away, so I need some good ideas for contests. So far what I've thought of include, Fanart contest, awful vocal/dance cover, Themed albums, ect. and I'll probably give one away with a random number generator.

I'm trying to do something different, Just give me an idea of what would be funny/interesting to do, I'll probably do it next time I upload another album. Help me give away my games for free please. 


And so this isn't a bad post

I made a Skype group for /r/SNSD called r/SNSD International. It will allow us to come together and chat together. A bunch of us got the idea from Twitter and it would be a great way to talk to each other more and get a better sense of who frequents this subreddit.

You can add me on Skype at anthonyvardiz and then I can add you to the group.

**EDIT:** I logged onto Skype and had a lot of contact requests. Unfortunately, I am at work and cannot add people to the SNSD group until I get home. I have the list of people who are already interested so I will add you to the group when I get back home. I'm glad there was interest \^_^",27,20

I was hoping it may show up on the new album but it doesn't look like it now (maybe their next Korean album?). They've also released CF full songs in the past. I guess perhaps because it was a Thai promotion it's in the hands of True. 

You can actually hear the entire song in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoHMrh044HE). It's looped several times and the announcer is speaking over a bit of it but you can hear it all (louder at 34:30 but fully from 27:02 to 29:16). It seems to be about 2m15s long, about the same length as the original.

For me it has the trifecta of being a Beatles cover, perfect english, and such great harmonies. I hope we can hear them harmonize more in the future.

edit: It's looking highly likely that this is **not** them singing after all.",16,8

613,2013-11-26,2013,11,26,8,1rgaxo,Burning questions about the SNSD operation,NewbieSone,1385420730,"Heyo, so I've been wondering about the way SNSD operates lately, and have a few questions:

* Do each of the girls have their individual managers and stylists, or do they all source from a team pool? How much is known about the organization structure immediately around the members? Do these people have been their working companions since their debut, or do they get rotated out frequently?

* I've noticed that when SNSD performs on random(?) TV shows, their coreo and the camera work and editing tend to still be highly coordinated. How does the interfacing between SNSD and the hosting show staff work? Is this high level of integration just down to the general experience level with these types of performances in the k-pop industry, or do they bring their own production staff with them? Or perhaps they do pre-viz inhouse and then sell the whole package to a show, i.e. ""we have a Hoot performance for three cameras, here's where you need to place them and a director's and editing guide""?

I'd love to hear any information you have about this sort of stuff, as well as pointers to good ""how the sausage is made"" resources for SNSD or failing that, general K-Pop.

I know there's behind the scenes clips for some of the MV shoots up on YouTube (and I basically watched them all by now :), and of course there's ""Girls Go to School"", but I'm wondering more about later-era full-scale stage production and tour life ... I've enjoyed watching things like the documentary feature on Kylie Minogue's Showgirls Homecoming tour, or ""Colours and Sound"", the documentary feature on Marillion's Marbles tour.

697,2013-11-29,2013,11,29,5,1ro1oo,A character skin referencing SNSD (Popstar Ahri) has released on PC game League of Legends!! &lt;3,arthurmauk,1385671949,"Some of you will know or play LoL already, but on the PC game [League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends), a character skin referencing SNSD's Genie [has been released](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/popstar-ahris-spirit-rush-tour-starts-today)! :DDD 

My playgroup and I organised a game where we played only this character, and this was the result: 

http://i.imgur.com/zlnIDUY.jpg 

and

http://i.imgur.com/SWuNfJE.jpg

Really proud of ourselves because if I knew if anyone could do it, it would be us, yay!! \^^

A bit of context: Almost exactly 1 year ago, 2 talented Korean LoL fans Pasha and Goomrrat published their concept [""Generation Ahri""](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13nv5v/girls_generation_ahri/) which was hugely popular with Sone LoL players and non-Sones alike. 

Over the year, players have been telling their wish to the games company Riot to make an official skin for the character. Finally this month, they granted our wish and made Popstar Ahri, a skin that references our favourite group!! You can see the similarities between their dances here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWz84APw6zw 

I think it's pretty cool because League of Legends is currently [the biggest game in the world](http://twitlonger.com/show/n_1rnhk03), and given its connections with SNSD and Korea, it can grow to become a very fruitful partnership. LoL is owned by Tencent which also owns Blade &amp; Soul, the MMO that is currently endorsed by SNSD. A Korean team won the LoL World Championship this year and next year's Championship will be held in Korea, so we're campaigning to get SNSD to perform at the Final!! :D",15,2

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (**Downvotes will not be counted**)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of the member (**Yuri** for this month).
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.

* Singapore = SNSD Makes Our Lives Complete

* Philippines = We thought You'd Never Come
* Taiwan = AYO GG
* Seoul Again= Let's Go Along For a Long Time

Does anyone know of any more of these? I'd assume there's ones I missed because I haven't been following the World Tour as much as I should be. 

Also for anyone who doesn't know what this is, it's the messages the fans [displayed](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XGxayMmuC8o/Ub7Z4Zaz1pI/AAAAAAABtFI/kQfIDbkj_YU/s1600/snsd+yoona.jpg) for SNSD when they did concerts in their area.",1,7
