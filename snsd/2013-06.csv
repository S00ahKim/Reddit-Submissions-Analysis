I've met a lot of Sone's of League of Legends and realized that we never got a chance to make a thread about it in this sub-reddit. A lot of you have already discovered this but for those who may have missed it we have a group of Sone's gathered into a Special Channel called ""SNSD"" on League of Legends.

How do I join the Channel? 

* Go to Friends and Click the Chat bot

* Hit the + and add SNSD

* Welcome to our League Community!

We are a strong community and often play with each other. We have people from Bronze to Diamond (Did fabbby let JJ into Challenger yet? lol) We're very kind to each other and always are online to talk! Be sure to ask someone before you add them (Kind and whatnot). We also have a raidcall group (ID: 6394511).

I have separated all of the [SNSD items in the shop into a section of their own](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KpopGear?section_id=13716930) so it's easier to find what you're looking for.

You may use the coupon on anything in the store, not just SNSD stuff. There are sections on the left side of the page for other groups and categories.

After the sale ends tomorrow the standard r/SNSD discount of 15% off will go back into effect with the coupon code **SNSDREDDIT**.

Thank you all so much. We are working on some new items that we hope to release within the coming weeks. If you have any requests, suggestions, or questions, please let me know!",0,19

For example, in my case, when I first started playing League of Legends about year and a half ago, i was like, why would i pay real money to buy skins and champions on a free to play game??? Then, as time went by and i loved the game more and more, I don't even know how much money i have spent on skins and champions lol. As with my SNSD obsession, when i thought i would never buy actual stuff and would be embarrassed, here I am now buying albums and shirts and proud of my SNSD swag.

If you guys want to hear what it means to me and why I have tattoos I'll comment too, but I'm more curious as to what it being SONE means to you guys and girls. ",26,5

I had heard the name once or twice before, but didn't really pay any attention to them until they were Wikipedia's Picture of the Day, and even then I kind of dismissed them as a generic pop group until I saw that Gee won Song of the Decade in South Korea. I decided to give the video a shot, and I have not stopped watching/listening to/following the group since.


**Songs**
My favorite so far is Gee (which will forever hold a special place in my heart), but I am a huge fan of All my Love is for You, Oh! (Korean version most, but I really like the Japanese version too), Mr. Taxi, Genie, Run Devil Run, Hoot, I Got a Boy, and The Boys.
I am really surprised by how much I like their music. Basically, I've really liked all the songs that I have listened to. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the chance to listen to many of their songs. Do you guys have any suggestions for the songs I should listen to next/videos I should watch next?

**Community** I realized how active the community is when I found this subreddit, but I was having some trouble figuring out terminology. Is the band's actual name Girls' Generation, or SNSD, or do both names work? Also, what exactly is [soshified.com](http://soshified.com)? It seems to be the official fan site, and I guess that's the place to find news and stuff like that? Finally, what exactly is SONE (or a SONE)? Does it mean a long-time or die-hard fan?

**TL;DR**
I'm new to the group, love their songs and am looking for suggestions for songs/videos, and also looking for clarification on the various community websites and terms. 

Thanks for the help!

EDIT: Very helpful and thorough responses from everyone, and lots of suggestions to keep me busy! I'd love to hear more if you have any! Thanks for welcoming me to the subreddit!",54,27

~~If you have any other questions you'd like to know about your fellow SONEs, feel free to post them below. Maybe the mods can do a real census with more questions :)~~

First post so please be nice :D 
Little background: I've been studying Korean for about 4 months now (Engineering student hoping to graduate with a Masters in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Korean) and I love SNSD ballads! Forever is my favourite ballad from SNSD. 

Question: Just now, I was going through my playlist and realised that the english title for "" "" (I believe this translates to ""caramel coffee"") was ""Talk To Me."" Out of curiosity, does anyone know why this English title was chosen? Is there some cultural significance?

Also, are there any other snsd song titles that you know of that aren't the actual translations from Korean to English? 

Thanks! ",13,18

So here is the list: 
Oh! Album.
Mr.Taxi Album.
Genie Album.
EDIT: Forgot to include Gee album, Taiwan edition.

$5 per album.

Girls' Generation - All About Girls' Generation ""Paradise in Phuket"" with the huge 300ish page preview book. 
Since EBAY has people selling it new for ~$126, I'm hoping for at least $50.

Shoot me a PM with an offer and hopefully we can meet somewhere. Pictures will be available upon request. I will be selling to highest bidder.

EDIT2: Yes I will also be willing to send these things over mail.
Also here are the pictures.

#Another year has passed and our SeoBaby is more and more becoming SeoLady. It feels like yesterday when she was that little teenage girl who just debuted in what was to be the most successful group in kpop. During all those years the maknae has always reminded us about what healthy foods we should eat, when we should sleep so ous cells can regenerate, what self-improvement books we should read. Let's have another SeoWonderful year together with Seo and the rest of the girls. ~ 

Now let's get to the pictures.

Not following the rules is a bannable offense!


^^^Just ^^^kidding.

---

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (**Downvotes will not be counted**)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a PNG format. The original picture can be a JPEG, but if you're going to do your own edit, please make sure it's a PNG. (**Make sure to post the original with your edited version! - So I can add it to the records**)
* The picture must be of SNSD, **no single member pictures**, either group shots or couple shots.
* One picture per post, but you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like [minus](http://minus.com/)) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.
