I mean, back when The Boys came out compared to Passionate Love, she changed so much! She looks a lot more... mature?

Was this because of a... (please^don't^misunderstand^me) surgery? I'm pretty sure it's not ""transformation into adulthood"" because she's already 22 or something and adults don't change very much at that age..

Am I the only one who noticed this?",18,0

______________________________________________________________________________________________

The first ACTUAL k-pop song i've heard is 4minutes - HUH, as I've wondered why Hyuna was on Gangnam style even if she seemed with a ""pikatchu"" voice. After that, i didn't actually research for other kpop songs.

One day of boredom i was looking for LoL dance references and i've fallen to Ahri's that is Run Devil Run dance. I was pretty amazed by the song and by the girls, even if for me seemed all the same, i could recognise them through hair. Between all the girls Yoona was the one that i liked most. After a while i've lost interest tho.

At summer 2012 i went to Swanage for 2 weeks. The day before i left italy i had the will of listen to Run Devil Run again, for no actual reason. With that, i've noticed on the side some of their songs, and i opted for ""Mr taxi"". I liked that song a lot, it was catchy, the girls looked again greatly but still i couldn't recognise them, and most of all i couldn't understand which was the gilrl that i liked on RDR music video (Yoona). But that didn't stop me from listen to that song every time i had an internet connection; i loved the dance version video, even if the quality wasn't the best. That left on that song many memories of that paradise and the good time i had in those 2 weeks.

The magic started some months later, when in an another boring day i was looking at new champions dances references, this time Syndra's one: hoot. At the beginning i didn't actually like the song that much, i said to myself ""meh, Run Devil Run and Mr Taxi sound better"". After few days i had that song stucked in my mind. I went to listen to it one more time and i've quite fallen for that song. I listened to it so many times... i thought i couldn't get bored of it. But after all, i didn't think about get into SNSD discography and look for other songs. The only thing i had from them was Hoot on my playlist nearly every time i listened to music. In the video i've tried again to understand which was the girl i liked on RDR video. At the end i matched RDR Yoona with Hoot Seohyun. They looked so similar to me that i got pretty sure about that. Even though i couldn't avoid to watch other 2 girls: Yoona and Jessica. They had pretty much the same hairstyle, so i confused them many times. I've started to ask their names on youtube, but i've forgot them in just one day and i kept looking at them unable to differentiate them.

After a while i've fallen to Dancing Queen MV. The song was Duffy's Mercy, but the girls hitted my poor lonely heart with those outfits {i prefere girls that looks as natual as possible, with less make up possible, and they looked like that in the video :P }. Once again, Yoona shines to me. With that, i decide myself to look for them on google and learn their names/faces, so i can understand who is who during dances. I made some corrections on the associations while i was ""learning them"". Started looking for Yoona wallpapers and the one that became my desktop was this (http://deskpoper.com/images/2012/10/girls-generation-snsd-celebrity-im-yoona-hd-wallpapers.jpg just with 1920x1080 resolution). But, after all, the contact with the girls was mostly visual; i just listened to hoot sometimes, not as frequently as i did at the beginning, but that was it.

More or less at may 2013, i was pretty depressed. I felt so worthless and sad, nothing could cheer me up, i was extremly stressed from my last year of high school and, most of all, i felt extremly lonely. As i fully believe on music influence on human mind, i always listen to music trying to match it on my status. With that i've randomly fallen to the old good Hoot and Dancing Queen. The girls dancing so happily in Dancing Queen made me watch that video every night before sleep, for get away bad thoughts and for relax. After a week of this, i couldn't get rid of them from my mind. I ordered my brain to get some energy and look for more of their songs. The first that came out was Paparazzi.

O. M. G.

That was comparable to an addiction... That video, their outfits, that dance, that music... Yoona! Omg Yoona... that was all so perfect to me, it was like a big flash that made literally (and still does in some moments) touched me. I don't know what's in that song, i just know that for now i've listened to it every day several times every day (at first even only it) for the last 5 months. The first month, i didn't listen to anything else. Paparazzi. End.

After that, I've got into The Boys. At first i didn't like it, but after 2-3 days it came up into my mind and i started to like it, for end to a Paparazzi-The Boys playlist on repeat 24/7.

But that wasn't the actual thing that made me become a strong fan. The actual thing was a random montage of funny moments from them. I have been depressed for years more or less, extremly lunatic and pretty much anything could really cheer me up. Maybe it happend that for 1-2 weeks max i didn't think about my life in that moment and i could manage to act happy to my friends, but at the end at home i was always angry/sad, even without a reason. I couldn't even enjoy anymore going out with my few friends. With that video, and with all the others, i've laughed with soul as i haven't done for a long time. That video gave a kick to my soul, waking it up, and removing from me most of the negativity i had. Yoona and Jessica made me laugh the most. I've watched the Sica Taxi interview 5-6 times, the compilations of funny moments several times. With the ""Night star"" (?), where they were in a truck in the middle of a square, the presentator asked who's the Korean national group, and the crowd that came there shouted ""SNSD"", i felt all the energy that those people had and the happiness that the girls felt. Watching at those shows, looking how funny and natural they were, and with all the times they made me laugh, i can say i've become a SNSD fan.

Now it's 4 months that i listen SNSD more or less 90% of the time, if not just them, and i think i've listened to all their songs or most of them; I've bought 3 albums (Girls Generation 1st japanese album, Girls &amp; Peace japanese tour album and Galaxy Supernova single; all cd + dvd edition).

Now i have, as everybody, bad days, but most of the time i'm happy and i enjoy to stay out with my friends. 

Their songs also helped me concentrate during my high school ending exam (i passed it  with a pretty higher mark than i expected before the end of the school year) so i matched this important period of my life to their songs.

TL; DR: I was a depressed and lonely guy who didn't enjoy anything; with Paparazzi i've got nearly addicted to their songs and their shows removed from me the sadness, making me laugh sincerely for the first time in a long time and making me enjoy going out with friends and other stuff.",33,16

A few examples:  

- In the kdrama ""Dream High"", the point where the 4 main characters start to understand each other is when they perform Tell me your wish in the middle of the streets.

- In the kdrama, ""I am Legend"", the protagonist becomes famous when she is caught by the elevator's camera singing Tell me your wish with her friends.

- In the korean movie ""Sunny"", the name of the rival girl group is ""Girls Generation"". There is also a bunch more small references to the girls themselves.

Do you guys know more stuff like this?

Edit: Forgot to mention, but there is also a bunch of songs about them. I think GDragon made a reference to Gee in one of his songs, and some other guy made an entire song about the girls.",33,14

i guess mine are:

1. I hate the english version of ""the boys"".. and im no fan of ""Oh"" i very nearly stopped my investigation into the group after those 2... and for awhile after i was looking more critically and i was pretty sure i wasnt going to like the group. 
2. I wasnt originally a Jessica fan (fany)
3. ? I dont know much about f(x) but i think i might like luna better than krystal... (please dont hurt me Jessica)
4. ? im pretty sure at some point SM is going to incorporate more realty show concepts into their training process... maybe just debut all their trainees of a certain age range/gender/experience then just play survivor with them or something. with image control though of course. then preferrably giving me 50 million dollars for that idea they probably already fired someone for bringing up
5. I probably made this thread to throw in those last 2 points of questionable relevance

---------------------------------------------------------



COSMOPOLITAN INTERVIEW (NOVEMBER ISSUE)  YURI

Jungeun, who receives the love of Lee Jongsuk and Seo Inguk in the film No Breathing, is far from the first love character that women hate. She hits guys in the back of the head often, and devours chicken feet in front of the guy who likes her. She doesnt confuse guys, and she doesnt cry apologizing to them either. After meeting Yuri, who doesnt act coy at all, I cant imagine who else could have played Jungeun.



--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** How was todays shoot? You played in front of the camera as if you were thinking, Try taking my picture if you can. Its something reporters are grateful for. Because there are a considerable amount of female celebrities who stubbornly do poses or make facial expressions that they think looks best for them, regard less of the photoshoot concept.


**YURI:** I was like that in the past, too. Not too long after debuting, I stubbornly made poses that I thought looked pretty. After doing that and attempting new things, I learned that I can look a lot prettier when I have a natural appearance. When doing photoshoots, I think pretty photos come about when theyre taken to suit the concept. Of course, your face looks prettiest then, too.



--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** Well, you do have a good face.


**YURI:** No, its really not! Haha.



--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** Personally, of the nine members of Girls Generation, I think Yuri suits Cosmopolitan the best. Youre healthy, full of energy, and sexy.


**YURI:** If you think that, then Im really glad. Cosmo shows the lifestyles of great women. Its also a magazine I really like. Thats really nice?


--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** When do you feel sexy? Moments when you feel that you seem okay.


**YURI:** When I get out after a shower? When I dont have anything on my face. I think that women who can pull off basic looks are beautiful. Not people who are pretty due to showy makeup, but people who look pretty because they ahve nice skin, and appearing pretty with just straight hair from having healthy hair. Also, when they have a nice body, so anything they wear looks pretty. Oh, and appearing healthy looks the prettiest..


--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** Is there a moment where something was out of your power?


**YURI:** When I was a trainee, it was a really snowy day. Because the roads were slippery, they said people shouldnt go outside. I dont know why I felt that I had to go, but as soon as school ended, I went to practice. Not surprisingly, the hill was so slippery that I fell a number of times. I had such a hard time getting there, but practice was cancelled. There were times where lessons would get cancelled occasionally. I spent 2 hours getting there, so what do you mean cancelled. I was disappointed and felt that they could have at least contacted us beforehand.


--------------------------


**COSMOPOLITAN:** Dont moments like that make you want to plump down on the street and cry?


**YURI:** I cried. I got on the subway crying, and there wasnt even anywhere to sit. At that time, after practice, I would always go home sitting on the floor in the subway train. But on that day, I seemed really pathetic sitting on the floor. I had vocal nodules too, and didnt have a lot of days left until evaluation. I had a hard time because I didnt like anything that was going on around me.

 It is hard to believe that just a while ago; we were little baby, baby boys and girls, about Tinkerbells 
size, with visual dreams so high they can touch the sky. Life was fun and sweet as honey that we can just go 
ooh la-la every time. Every fall and mistake will be all right with just your dear mom kissing you, and youll be
 happy again like a hat trick. Its fantastic that a merry-go-round ride or just a sweet delight will make your life
 complete as how caramel coffee is to cake. You think this will continue day by day but youll eventually wake up
 and realize youre entering the etude of adolescence; high school. In here youll learn that life is not you-aholic and will not say yes to what your snowy wish tell and there is no beautiful stranger, but definitely more 
interesting. Youll be encountering problems but youll just have to let it rain. We thought this would last forever 
and but now it has come to an end. Our parents are now happy for us graduating and we are like Oh gee, we 
are beginning our way to go into the new world. and stuff. We will get so hyped and excited but at the end of the day realize we just couldn't get enough of high school, and will drop tears or two. Unfortunately there exists
 no time machine or a genie to wish to turn back the time. Sounds lame, but it actually happens the same for 
both the boys and girls. Generation is in itself an empty word unless we make it meaningful with the happy 
memories we make and cherish, and it will echo for eternity.

EDIT: how to format this thing??

Has there ever been a single day in life
where it has been calm
Flowers blossom splendidly
but suddenly rain falls and snowstorms come.

But if we were to live as we love,
Would that not be a successful life?

Rather live a stale and numb life devoid of feeling,
Being sad, happy, in admiration, inspired, lonely, having fun...
Isn't that what real living is?

Even now emotions are on a see-saw, full of hope then full of dread.
To be filled with joy but then submerged in sorrow... do you still feel it?
Then perhaps you are now in love with life itself.

I will show you how I find sources with about a 80-90% success rate. It is really easy and simple! I promise.

Let's use these gifs of Sooyoung currently on the /r/SNSD front page.

http://i.imgur.com/gNNpTUM.gif

http://i.imgur.com/RzQ7jAf.gif

First, look to see any water marks. It shows ""S-OOYOUNGS"" in the bottom right corner. Use Google and search it. You come up with this tumblr blog http://s-ooyoungs.tumblr.com/. Any luck finding the source there? Not really, let's go to the next step.

What else can we use from the gif? Well there are lyrics in the gifs. ""Duplex and checks"" is a line from the Christmas song ""Santa Baby"". If you don't know what the song is, use Google and search! 

Ok, so now we know Sooyoung is singing ""Santa Baby"". Now we return to Google and search [""Sooyoung SNSD Santa Baby""](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sooyoung+SNSD+Santa+Baby&amp;oq=Sooyoung+SNSD+Santa+Baby). Now we look at the video previews and try to find similar looks and setting to the gifs. Not coming up with anything that looks like that stage. Time to revise search criteria.

Let's try just [""SNSD Santa Baby""](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww&amp;ei=LAlsUv2xMougjAL49ICoDQ&amp;ved=0CBgQ1S4#hl=en&amp;q=snsd+santa+baby). Oh look! the first video preview kinda has the same colors. Let's click on it.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WY4dTlgt08

Now we watch the video and/or use the mouse to scan over the buffer bar to look for Sooyoung. There she is [@1:19](http://youtu.be/0WY4dTlgt08?t=1m19s)!

Now you have found the source. Good job!

I know it will not be the same way to search and look for things every time. Just use some investigative skills and look for details that can lead you to the source. This will also lead you to somethings that you never knew, some great performances you may have missed, or even a fantastic blog or youtube channel with all of your favorite. It will also help you obtain more information about anything SNSD or Kpop related.

So next time when you think about asking for the source in the comment section, just try to search a couple of things first. If you find it, great! Then post it in the comments for others to find and watch quickly. Hopefully you all found this helpful and obtain a little more knowledge and skills in finding what you want!

**TL;DR** Looks for details and watermarks that give information on the source. Use Google to search those details. Revise search if you don't get results. Obtain knowledge for future use and reference.",15,24

I have no idea if this will actually be used at, but I'll be around and try to help. So it exists now. So use it. Come add to the [resource list](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSDrequest/comments/1pag2a/resource_list/), ask for a source, answer other people's questions. Use the subreddit.

664,2013-10-30,2013,10,30,13,1piplw,Free shirt with all KpopGear purchases (until supplies run out) - Details within,keithmsf,1383108126,"**EDIT: MEDIUM IS NOW SOLD OUT FOR THE FREE SHIRT DEAL.**

What's up everyone! I've been really busy lately, so I haven't come out with any new SNSD stuff for my [KpopGear store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear) in awhile. 

Recently I invested in an all new printing setup, so I printed a bunch of shirts with various SNSD designs from my store to test out my new equipment. Since I can't possibly wear them all, I decided I would give them to /r/snsd buyers since you guys have always been big supporters of my shop.

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention initially that the brands of shirts may vary, as I experimented with some brands I've never used before to see how they compare. The fits might be *very* slightly different if you get one of the different brand shirts, but nothing too out of the ordinary.

Here are the details:

1. Make a purchase of any shirt at the [KpopGear store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear)

2. Enter coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** at checkout. This gets you 15% off and lets me know who to send the free stuff to.

3. The shirts are already printed in a variety of sizes/colors/styles. I can't fulfill specific requests for the giveaways. I will include a shirt the same size as the one you purchased for free. If you have a special request for the shirt you're purchasing, just pm me and I'll do my best to make it happen.

4. This deal will go on as long as supplies last. I printed quite a few of every size, but I will provide updates if/when a certain size runs out.

5. Thank you all so much and, as always, message me with any questions, comments, requests, or suggestions!
