Can't believe we were so happy to hear about their renewal and now we have an 8 member Girls' Generation. As I've stated before, I love them all and I will support them, but it's not the same, it's really hard to get used to the idea of SNSD as an 8 member group. OT9 will forever hold a special place in my heart.

*sigh* One can dream, right?

Judging by this article, I believe Jessica over SM because she personally broke the news first before SM was able to release a statement and put their spin on it. So I believe something had happened between Aug and Sept and then Sept 16 and Sept 30 for the other members to change their minds, and I believe SM is behind it.",0,1

So do Mariah Carey and J-Lo, who have singing/performing careers and children.  She's given over half her life to SMEnt, and made them more money than they ever had any right to expect.  If she only performs and promotes a handful of events, that's still more money than they'll ever see from 95% of their trainees.  A contract isn't signing your life over to indentured servitude.  As DBSK amply demonstrated, people can outgrow the nest, and move on to bigger and better things.

In a way, I'm happy for her.  Where she used to be animated and shamelessly joyful in her American way, for several years she's been wearing a careful smiling mask that rarely slips in public.  After years upon years of tireless schedules, she's earned her rest and the credit pursue her ambitions and dreams in whatever way she sees fit.  It my take a little time, but I very much doubt this is the end for OT9.  They will find their way back to one another in the end.",4,0

19,2014-10-1,2014,10,1,14,2hyqu7,The SOSHI bond is real!,Spiky_porc,1412140228,"With all that's been happening, people have started to doubt the soshi bond so I just want to chime in with my 2 cents here if anyone can be bothered reading a random sone's opinion.

First and foremost, the soshi bond is real, you don't know someone for 15 years and simply feel nothing for each other. Think about it, these girls have been together for over decade. They sweated together, they trained together, they cried together, they lived together, they performed together, they achieved their dreams together. You don't do all these kinds of things with other people for over a decade without forming some kind of emotional bond.

I've been a sone for over 4 years and have seen almost every tv appearance they have ever had. Sure, it is tv so a lot of it can be fake, their words may be fake, their stories may be fake, their personalities may be fake. But you have to look deeper. Watch their shows and you will see the way they unconsciously lean in to each other, the way they touch each other when they speak, the glints in their eyes when they talk about the stories of the experiences they have shared with each other. This stuff can't be falsified.

And with all that's been happening, let's face it, friends fight. If you tell me you haven't fought with your best friend before, I call bullshit. The fact in life is that the people who have the capability of hurting you the most is the people that you hold dearest. Whether it was intentional or not, feelings among the members of SNSD have been hurt. The feeling of hurt caused by a loved one is like no other and may cause regretful words to be said and intense feelings of betrayal. Betrayal, itself, is defined as a violation of trust meaning that the SNSD members wholeheartedly trusted each other.

So remember this, a bond is a bond, it may lead to happiness but it may also lead to feelings of betrayal. No matter what happens from here on out, remember this, the underlying emotional bond between the members was not a facade, it was real. No matter how this bond is conveyed in their feelings, the soshi bond, was, is and will always be real.  ",8,0

I was already way too old (35 yr old divorcee) to be attracted to them romantically, but something about their innocence and talent hooked me. I even dragged my close friends to a Wondergirls concert (in Houston, TX) because I was crazy into KPop! I am now 41 (soon to be 42) and my close friends still don't understand that I like GG not because of how beautiful they are, but because of what they represent. I have always heard how fake/superficial Koreans can be, which I always struck up to cultural differences (born and raised in America).

I don't propose we boycott the girls as Sones we support all members and that means continuing the support for each one of them and their future endeavours this should be done primarily on the their SNS because it seems that's where they have the most freedom to speak for themselves but I say we boycott SM that means no official merchandise, official events (SMTown) and things like that.

32,2014-10-1,2014,10,1,21,2hzisu,"So, this is my last post here. It's time for me to say goodbye.",Mindflizzle,1412168335,"2014 has been too much for me. I broke. Way back in the day, I was a huge DBSK fan and they broke up and I could handle it. I was also a big Kamilia and when KARA broke up it hurt me like all hell, but I was able to handle it. Now with recent events, on top of the events that's happened within this year, I've found that I can't handle much of anything anymore. 

I'm a huge proponent of OT9. You can't have Girls' Generation without the 9 members and Girls' Generation was more to me than just a group of people. I'm too stupid and tired right now to put it in words, but it is what it is. I thought the SoshiBond was nigh unbreakable, that the members would support each other no matter what. But with Jessica's last post about not only SM, but also her *members* telling her to leave, I think that was the final straw for me. I think if it were only SM conducting this symphony of madness, I would be relatively fine. Sure, Jessica wouldn't be a member anymore but OT9 is still there, the SoshiBond still alive and well and that's what matters most to me. However, knowing that the members had a hand in orchestrating her leaving just tells me that the SoshiBond is dead. 

I've dwelled on it for an entire day now, whether or not to ride out this storm, to still support OT8 with the huge elephant in the room that is Jessica's absence, and I've come to the decision that if the members can't support each other then I can't support the members. I knew SNSD wasn't going to be forever, but I thought they'd beautifully fade away into obscurity as their time comes to an end, and not ending in the way it has. 

I'm rambling now. I don't even know why I'm writing this at all in the first place. Maybe just to throw my thoughts and feelings somewhere, I don't know. But anyways, yea, I'm done with SNSD. I'm done with Kpop in general. I've been a SONE since 2008 man. All the bad stuff that's happened between then and now I've been able to ride through because the Girls stood through it together, with each other. But now that SoshiBond's broken, and so I've broken. 

It was good while it lasted. I've made a lot of friends a memories through SNSD. Too bad it has to end the way it did.

I first met Girls' Generation because of the dances in the game ""League of Legends"", at the start of this year, so I started listening to ""Run Devil Run"" and got confused a lot of times, once I didn't understand that they were a korean group that also sings in japanese, and because of that, I started looking forward to know more about the group. It happens I got addicted to it. This sub-reddit became part of my routine, even though I never did a single comment before (I think so), every single morning I wake up I come here and check what happened that day.  
  

I don't want to say I'd listen to them in sad times, but in times when I  felt lonely, so basically **to cheer me up**.  
Lately with the sad news, my head got really messed up, and I had no one to talk about it, only with a few people I met in twitter. And when I come here, everyone is kinda as devastated as I am, and it made me feel a little bit better because I was not the only one feeling that way. 
   
**BUT THEN** I remembered why I started to listen to Soshi.  
  
I want to ask everyone in here how can we help each other, and if you feel not that good, how can I help you?

that snsd members actually wanted the best for her by making her go on with what she really wants to do. that jessica was really trying hard but just couldnt give it all so its for the best for her to go. 

i just really hope this is the truth, because, otherwise, one of them is about to go down... 

if it goes i do believe that :

-either jessica will fail and people will hate her for choosing her business. 

- or people will hate snsd for forcing her out (if they really planned against her (which i doubt))... 

and i just dont want neither of those to be truth...

im just saying that there might be two sides of the story. 

maybe, enventhough they ultimated her,  the members had good intentions with it, maybe jessica misunderstood them. or maybe not...

i hope we will not have to accept that the rest of the memebers are actually selfish nor that jessica was the one being selfish and trying to be victimized. i just hope the truth is not anything like that... as a sone i dont want to face something like that! it would be our fall!

i could explain my theories but ive written enough for today, and also i want to know your opinions.

This whole Jessica thing is crazy, and everyone is feeling different things, and it just sucks. But none of us are really involved in this situation, and none of us know all the details. Even what has been revealed is very likely leaving information out. It's not right that anyone judge what's going on, and especially not pit anyone against the other. It's one thing being angry at SM, because history has shown us that they don't treat everyone fair, and twist words around to not be the bad guy. But it hurts my heart to see people getting angry at Jessica, or at the rest of the girls. Nobody knows how any of them are feeling.

One thing that's true, is the ""soshibond"". You can't call bullshit on it, because there's hundreds of thousands of pictures and videos of their lives that show how close they were and how close they all are, there's just no way it's all for show. Sure things change, and it's unrealistic to say there aren't times they don't get along, but I can guarantee that the remaining 8 are not pretending to be upset. They did not want Jessica to leave, or to not have her business. If anything they just cared about the importance of the group as a whole, if they truly gave Jessica an ultimatum, I'm sure they discussed it for the benefit of them all. It's not as if THEY kicked her out, even if you believe that, they don't have that power. It's ultimately the decision of SM, and that's what it was. And Jessica wasn't abandoning anyone, she signed the contract, she wasn't noticibly absent from any group activities, and she even said she wasn't ready to quit. She was just preparing for what happens after, and something about that pissed off the company. I refuse to believe that the girls wanted her out, or that Jessica wanted to ditch the rest of them. Enough of what he have truly seen over the years proves that, and I know you all know it to be true.

Details aside, it really just bothers me to see anyone getting angry at one party or another, with no regards to how they must be feeling, or the true aspects of what is happening. Either way it's their life, and going forward they should really all be deserving of love and support regardless. I'm amazed at how a large portion of this previously huge and supportive fanbase has completely flip-flopped and turned on members based solely on a one-sided block of text from Jessica, and a much much less trustworthy one from SM. The fans need to remember the last 7 years, falling in love with the lives of these 9 girls, and seeing how incredible they all are as people. Those things haven't changed in this messed up situation, but it seems to some people that those feelings were worth nothing, being changed like the flip of a switch. They are still 9, whether together or apart, and fans should continue to support each individual member, in a group or out of it. This is still Jessica. This is still Taeyeon. And Sunny. And Tiffany. And Yuri. And Hyoyeon. And Yoona. And Sooyoung. And Seohyun. Care for them in this tough time, they do all they can for the fans. In this situation they're damned if they do, and damned if they don't, but with hate from fans things can only get worse. They will be 9 to us, one way or another, so please be supportive and understanding.

Sorry for the long rant, just something I needed to say.


**TL:DR;** In this Jessica situation, no one knows EXACTLY what is happening, or what to believe, but turning on Jessica, or the rest of the girls, will not help anything. Remember the last 7 years, and continue support for these 9 people that we love, individual or together.",64,19

I'm hurting. Deep in the bowls of my heart with everything that's currently happening with our beautiful girls. I've seen them grow from the beginning of their  'Gee era' all up to now. All I wanna do is cry and stop watching, listening and removing everything SNSD from my life.

But I can't. And that's because even though my heart keeps saying, ""Stop this shit now or I'll make you cry"" my brain says, ""You still love them. Each. And. Every. Single. One. Of. Them.""

So I bring y'all to this. As an avid SNE I will still support them all as OT9 or OT9. I think it's the more logical and adult thing to do. I've supported them from their acting carriers to TTS, to even jumping overseas to Japan and even America and to Baby 'Sica opening BLANC (if I were a female, I'd buy them glasses!).

Whenever the truth will come to light, I'll always love them. No matter what. And I truly hope that as other SNES you all do the same. :)

Recently, I have noticed the news around Jessicas leave has died down and that is exactly what SM entertainment wants the fans to do, to get distracted and forget. Sources stated theres less than 10% chance that Jessica could re-join SNSD, however, have we thought about where they came up with the 10%? Of course, its due to the discretion of the members, Jessica and debatably the most important factor: SM Entertainment. Us fans might not be able to affect the former two, but as a collective unit, can determine or at least sway SM Entertainments decision. From an economic position, SM Entertainment is a market supplier and we are the demand, a market CANNOT exist without BOTH supply and demand. Suppliers will almost always want to produce what is demanded by the market.

Some of you guys might argue that this will hinder the current performance of current SNSD as 8. But we have to ask ourselves, is 8 still SNSD that we really loved? Are the remaining members really happy? Even though the members cannot openly express their opinions (due to company restrictions), theres a high chance that they want SNSD back as 9, and right now they need fans support to carry out their voice more than ever. Think about it, theyve been together for 10+ years, TRAINING and LIVING together and achieving EXCEPTIONAL results. Even if they doubted Jessicas main focus, or Jessica might be a bit lost recently, they would not want to give up their childhood dreams together, their dream as 9. Its like being in a family. You dont disown a child, just because they swayed a bit from their path. 

Lastly, Jessica has stated that she WANTS to be part of SNSD (takes out the first factor stated), even after the next album, she is still willing to work hard to follow the schedule.  Sica is a person who is known to love sleep more than anything, and right now shes willing to give up her sleep to continue to be part of the group. Maybe due to some miscommunication or lack of contact, Sica has made some bold statements about her members. We all know Jessica has a blunt and straight-forward personality, almost to the point of being nave when dealing with emotions and likes simplicity (I mean who else would leave for New York when your career path is on the line).  Thus, I believe the company might have made a trap and all of SNSD has fallen into it.  

Now more than ever, is where we need to voice our concerns, bring attention to the matter, SHOW THEM WE WONT ACCEPT A SNSD WITH 8 MEMEBERS. In the end, if the fans dont believe, whos there left to believe in our beloved SNSD? We have to show the company that they have WAY more to lose if they kick Jessica. Even if its just for the 10% chance, even if its the support of a single person, if we all believe, if we all dream, that could turn the 10% into 100%, and collectively we can turn the 1 person into tens of millions of support. There comes a time where sitting in the sidelines is no longer enough, we have to actively voice our desires. 

You have to dream before your dreams can come true A. P. J. Abdul Kalam	

P.S. If this has made any sense to you what so ever, please share it on social media to get attention. I dont need any credits, I just want to be the 1 of millions that believe. 

TLDR: Support SNSD as 9, us fans are the only chance they have to get back together, they need us more than ever! SHARE!

157,2014-10-7,2014,10,7,9,2ii6gi,Objective View of SM Entertainment's Future Actions on the Jessica Issue,SNSD_OT9,1412640715,"To SM Entertainment:
Outlined below are some of many objective reasons why the company should try to reunite Jessica with SNSD instead of its other intentions:

As a company, the goal should be to maximize shareholder value at all times, which is essential a measure of companys bottom line, balance sheet strength and future opportunities/threats. From a balance sheet perspective (not following IFRS, but rather investor logic), 9 members of SNSD would be considered a large single capital asset due to their collective ability on generating future revenue and having a similar useful life (i.e. an automobile and its tires are to be considered a single asset, since tires are necessary for the automobile to realize its full useful value). 

Over SNSDs trainee years, the company has incurred many expenses and those amounts are to be capitalized (since the end product is successful). The asset is further appreciated by the groups success over the years and becoming a global icon. By removing Jessica, the useful life and revenue generating ability of the whole asset has to be revalued (since the group cant be sold, theres not market value). Which leaves one alternative, the asset has to be valued at the present value of its future cash flow generating abilities.  In reality, the revenue generating portion is decided by the fans (who mostly support SNSD as 9, also including the hard-core Jessica fans). As a result, both asset value and revenue generation ability of the company will go down. Furthermore, the goodwill of company would decrease from its reputational loss due to the companys lack of care for its artists. This could affect companys current and future performances. 
From an income statement prospective, minimal contract expenses have to be paid regardless (fixed expenses), but any additional revenue generation from previously planned Jessicas activities would be significantly reduced from this situation (assuming revenue &gt; variable costs, or else there would be no reason for the company to sign anyone on SNSD). 

To summarize, the consolidated effects of removing Jessica is: a) a reduction in companys assets, b) a reduction in companys net income and c) a loss for future talent for the company (due to its reputational loss) and negative publicity

The financial valuation consequences need not to be reminded by me, since the 8% decrease of the companys stock in the past days speak out way louder than I do. One thing to remember is even though the company has other revenue sources and may still be profitable without Jessica, financial analysis is performed at a RELATIVE basis, the company should always look to generate the most value of every single asset.  Though I do not know the details of this situation, but all the above reasons point to the company should encourage or even mediate this situation and continue SNSD as 9 member group. 

Also, all of the fans are hoping for the same thing, no fans would be gained through having SNSD as an 8 member group.

P.S. If this post has made any sense to you guys what so ever, please share it on social media to get attention. I dont need any credits, I just want to get this message through to the companys management (since I cant seem to find their contact information).

Feel free to sub in anyone close with SNSD and yes post more snsd baseball pics if you have any.

1. [Sunny](http://imgur.com/jMDg6Ds) (3B) - Persistent and quick. Is good all-around member (variety queen, singing, aegyo, etc.) Will often get on base and also be a threat to steal. Also will man the hot corner.
2. [Taeyeon](http://imgur.com/lHy4W7n) (SS) - Kid leader is scrappy player but has ajumma tendencies. Makes contact with the ball, good bunter. 
3. [Yoona](http://imgur.com/Rjp4Vj9) (LF) - [Has long arms and is on the stronger side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtuO5ThGoPA). Makes for a good slugger. 
4. [Hyoyeon](http://imgur.com/opCtTjR) (CF) - The cleanup hitter. [Also fastest one on the team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOX95ADkPyU), which makes for best fielder.
5. [Sooyoung](http://imgur.com/jXtQls8) (1B) - [Will strikeout or hit homeruns.](http://imgur.com/Fh5sWbM) Tallest member at 172 cm, good for catching wild throws.
6. [Tiffany](http://imgur.com/WlRi5dm) (RF) - Will make those amazing over the wall catches, especially wearing those bunny ears.
7. [Seohyun](http://imgur.com/Sw33aHZ) (C) - The smartest member. Has the ability to call a game, knowing which pitches to call and when.
8. [Jessica](http://imgur.com/15h10Q6) (2B) - Works closely with SS, because Taengsic. Will make the double plays, but honestly not impressed with her [throwing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9x3GRTozns). Thinking of subbing her with [Krystal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b70WZyrIQjc).
9. [Yuri](http://imgur.com/SrA0sWZ) (P) - [By far the best pitcher on the team.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtuO5ThGoPA) Best submarine pitch in kpop.

They inspired me to learn about the Korean culture, which led me to learn about the East Asian culture, than cultures of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Through that, I became the extremely multicultural and open person that I am today. 

Before SNSD, I had the typical American mindset: largely ignorant about the world yet doesn't care to learn about it either. I began to listen to music in other languages like German, French, Spanish, Hindi, and Arabic instead of just English (and recently added Korean). It led me to become a very diverse person that was open to just about everything from everywhere. I am never closed up to anything like I was before and am willing to give everything a try. The world is so interesting and although I don't have any money to, I would love to go everywhere and meet so many people of all these varying cultures. 

I love that about me and I thank SNSD for starting it. I may not be the biggest or most dedicated fan out there but I sure am glad I stumbled upon RDR on YouTube in 2010. It caused a huge change in my life that I would never take back. 

How about you guys? ",36,23

First, here's the new [OT9 Forever shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/207795252/girls-generation-snsd-ot9-forever-k-pop?) I made. 

Next, I made an [""I Ship TaeNy"" shirt,](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208793990/i-ship-taeny-locksmith-girls-generation?ref=listing-shop-header-0) by request from several people, including a few of you here and on the survey I took a while back. Of course I had to choose pink for the default pic. Thanks for the suggestion!

Also, I was running the other day and was thinking about how I always see gym shirts for schools and teams, so I made a [Soshi gym shirt.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208803973/girls-generation-snsd-athletic?ref=listing-shop-header-1) It's perfect for working out or just being casual. 

Lastly, I added a new [Orange Caramel design](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206210426/orange-caramel-olenji-kyalamel-raina?) and a new [Ramones-inspired Big Bang shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206063317/big-bang-vs-the-ramones-vip-seal-logo-k?). Both groups were overwhelmingly requested when I took my survey here on /r/snsd.

As always, use coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** for 15% off any order. 

Since it's getting chilly out, if you want to request any shirt in a hoodie or regular sweatshirt just message me and I should be able to make that happen.

Thanks, and as always send me any suggestions and requests you might have!",13,16
