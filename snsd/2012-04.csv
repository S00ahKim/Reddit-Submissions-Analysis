this is dreadtech, senior staffer from snsdkorean, we're a humble blog that tries (read: TRIES) to provide updated and news worthy posts on our blog along while trying to do it with room for creativity and laid back fun. I've been a reddit lurker for almost 2 years and have never really set foot into r/snsd until 2-3 months ago. It literally took me that long to notice our site on the sidebar. On behalf of snsdkorean, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, you guys are awesome. Thank you guys for choosing our blog for information for our wonderful Soshi girls. I'm sure this might be downvoted to oblivion but I'm happy all the same to try and give my appreciation to r/snsd. questions of any sort are welcome (might as well turn this into an AMAA)

I'll be sure to pop by a lot more (but don't count on any posts).

Ive been in Korea now for 5 years and Ive done various acting/recording/voice work/music/radio/media jobs. Over the years Ive met and become chummy with a bunch of producers and directors etc... too. SO I got an email from a friend who is playing the part of a guitarist in the video and they needed a bass player (baritone guitarist by trade, but a bassist of 15 years) for the video. This is actually how Ive gotten 90% of the fun/weird acting jobs ive gotten (i was a gangster in a movie recently).

I sent in my info for the part, but im not getting my hopes up, sounds like its perhaps to good to be true.

If I dont get the spot I will get any info I can about the video, music and/or the shoot and share with you guys a bit later. If I get the spot Ill do a AMA aswell.

--------------------------------

Update: video was postponed. Don't know about my spot yet. My friends agent is claiming it's a new song and not something that's been out I.e the boys. He's gonna call the agent and just out right ask.  

---------------------------------


Update Update: I wasnt able to get the spot because of an extremely lame scheduling conflict. As it turns out it wasnt SNSD but it was Twinkle. So my ""insider info"" was correct aside from the name, however, I didnt get to be in it, and that sucks....alot.

Would have posted this question in r/Korean, but didn't feel like posting such a simple, and sone orientated question over there. 

Anyway, so   means ""Tell me your wish"", correct? But what does the  at the end mean? I know  = to see, and I was taught  at the end of a word meant something along the lines of ""(-) and see"". 
E.G,  = go and see.  = eat and see. 
So basically   is used when you want someone to try something. So, is this used the same way in  ? Does   literally mean ""Tell me your wish and see"", but we just translate it as ""Tell me your wish"" because it sounds better? Or am I completely off?

Sorry if this is ambiguous.

313,2012-4-26,2012,4,26,7,ssi7f,We've all discussed how long it took to recognize each girl...how long did it take you to recognize their voices?,Vathe,1335392070,"These are the threads for the true SONEs :)

Certain girls have very distinct voices,  Jessica/Sunny are probably the most unique within the group.  Jessica has a somewhat sharp (not in the pitch sense) voice, and Sunny just sounds like Sunny.
   
Taeyeon is easy to pick up, and you can pretty much assume she is singing if you don't know who is. 
   
Tiffany is pretty distinctive, although I don't really know the terminology for her voice.  She sounds a lot more ""American Idol"" than the rest of the girls.  

Seohyun is easy to pick up for me, but she's my bias, so I'm not sure how well others can.  

When Hyoyeon does get lines, her raspy voice is pretty easy to spot.  Yoona is similar, having a rather deep voice.  

Sooyoung and Yuri are occasionally audible, but their quiet singing combined with lack of lines makes them pretty hard to pick out for me.  When they rarely belt out some nice vocals they are pretty singular, but Yuri is almost always really quiet.  

On topic, Jessica was easy to recognize after a few songs, and Taeyeon soon enough because of her sheer number of lines.  Yoona and Hyoyeon were easy to pick up because anytime you hear those deep voices you know who's singing.  Sunny came shortly after, and eventually I could pick up Tiffany and Seohyun.   Yuri and Sooyoung still give me trouble, depending on the song.  I'd say I was able to recognize most of their voices after a month or so.

Sigh, I spend longer typing up posts like this than writing papers...worth it!",18,14

However, I do not have a US account for iTunes, thus I cannot buy the Twinkle album.

However, there is a shop in Hong Kong that sells Korean stuff, and I got all my SNSD albums.

I was just wondering if the Twinkle album will be released in a ""physical"" CD format, much like their other albums, or will it be limited to a ""virtual"" copy as in released on iTunes?

If it'll be released in a physical CD copy, then I can just buy it from the shop since they get the new albums within a week. However, if it's iTunes only, then I'm pretty screwed.

So, does anyone know if a ""physical"" copy will come out?

I thought I would share this with r/snsd since it's more related. I'm from BC, my cousin is also a Sone, I originally posted this on her facebook.

""So went to get my car tuned up today. The mechanic I go to is a korean man. He said it would only take an hour so I could wait in the office. His wife who doesnt speak much english is there watching a drama. I start to pull up a chair and the following conversation takes place:

me: Annyeonghaseyo, Drama bwo yo?

her: Ne, drama.

me: Can I watch?

her: Oh, are you korean?

me: Aniyo,...learning, but I like watching drama.

her: What drama?

me: Um..Peshion Wang...Sarang Bi.

her: Oh. (chuckles)

me: Ne, drama johayo. Hangookei eummak johayo.

her: Ah, So Nyeo Shi Dae?

me: Ne! Majayo!

So funny! So watched the drama while asking her questions and trying to converse in korean lol.""

Part 3/5 of the movie.
http://moe.nyan.tv/movies/78893
Even the videos on nico nico were all down.

Did anyone manage to download the whole thing? 
Or has anyone managed to find most of it?

I hope for the sake of mankind that it hasn't been lost from us.

413,2012-4-30,2012,4,30,22,szoyj,Concerning Love Rain: why are the ratings so low?,LaBrosseN7,1335792391,"Factually, it has a star-studded cast and crew. The director and writer are those of Winter Sonata and Autumn in my Heart; certainly no chumps. 

Yoona's first drama, You Are My Destiny, had an average of around 30ish percent of viewer share. One can argue that it being a daily drama it had more hype, but come on, 30% doesn't compare to the average of 6% ratings that Love Rain gets.

And Jang Geun Seuk... well, he's no chump either.

=\ I just feel sorry for Yoona, is all. Must be demoralizing to have your latest drama to be your least popular. ",42,13
