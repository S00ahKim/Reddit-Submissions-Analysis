I counted the member if she was the first person to sing/rap/whatever in the song. I did not count everyone singing together as a category. Some songs it could be argued who sang first so I put that note in parenthesis but those did not go into my final count. I also only used songs from the albums as well as the few singles I am familiar with. I also did not include TTS songs because they are not the full SNSD.

Most of my data was collected by looking up the lyrics online or watching the videos when available. The songs where I had to guess the member I have noted.

Let me know what you think and tell me where I'm wrong! The final results were pretty interesting.

Inspired by this thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/tmmh2/where_is_todays_sidebar_photo_from/), I've decided to make a thread dedicated to the pictures used for the headers and sidebar on /r/SNSD. I think every time I change the pictures, there's always one or two threads asking for the original, this thread will have all the pictures ready, for those who want them :D

(a test run),DJ_Byun,1337118185,"As you guys might have noticed, I started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/tog5m/the_epic_sidebar_header_pictures_thread/) with the collection of past sidebar and header images for those who wanted the original images. Some thing I've always wanted to do ([and has come into my attention again](http://www.reddit.com/r/SNSD/comments/tog5m/the_epic_sidebar_header_pictures_thread/c4oe638)) is to have a thread to decide what you guys want on the sidebar. I've always wanted to do this, as sort of a community activity (this subreddit belongs to all of us after all), a way for everyone to participate in the visuals of this subreddit.

This will be our first attempt at this sort of thread (for our dear Yoona, who's time comes to tomorrow) and if it works out well and you guys enjoy it, we'll have a new thread for every time we mods decide to change the sidebar picture.

---

**The Rules:**

* The top 3-5 pictures (we will only go with 3 for the remainder of May), with the most upvotes, will be used in the member's month (if it's a free month, than it will be a group picture). The one with the single highest upvote count will be used on the the actual birth date. Downvotes will not be counted, just FYI.
* The image posted must be bigger then (or at) 300 x 360. If you wish to edit your own picture at those dimensions, you are welcome to do so (make sure the image is in **PNG** format). If you do edit your own image, please post the original as well.
* The image must be a picture of the member by herself (in this case Yoona). If it's a group picture, make sure everyone is visible and it has to have all 9 members.
* **Only one picture per post**. (I will change this rule, if needed).
* I would prefer everyone to host their image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or something similar (like minus).

---

So with that said, if this works out well, we'll be doing threads like this on a regular basis (starting with Yoona). So everyone, get to posting your favorite Yoona picture :P

I wasn't there, but since Yoona is my bias, I would have been very distraught had I gone. 

While I understand they may have other things like dramas to film, couldn't it be put off for a week? SM Town is a big deal to US fans, since we don't get to see them live very often at all. On the other hand in Korea, they have 3 major music shows they could attend. 

It seems unfair to me to have international fans wait 6-12 months for the next concert to have the -possibility- of seeing the whole group together while they could just have drama fans wait a week. 

Do you think it's justified? I know the girls are always busy, so I wouldn't recommend doing anything if they were feeling sick/stressed/tired. But a lot of fans are expecting SM to put out, and I feel like the experience is incomplete having only part of the members there. ",24,16

It was a good enough reaction to merit a thread for Seohyun, and if we continue to get a good turn out, we'll do a thread for every month involving a member.

----

###***The Rules:***

* The top 5 pictures with the most upvotes will be chosen. The picture with the single highest upvotes will be used on the member's actual birth date. (Downvotes will not be counted)
* The picture must be larger than 300 x 360. You can edit your own picture in those dimensions, and please make sure it's in a **PNG** format.
* The picture must be of the member (Seohyun for this month).
* One picture per post, you can post multiple times.
* For convenience, please host your image on [imgur](http://imgur.com/) and I would prefer the image to be recent, not necessary, but a more recent image would be better.
