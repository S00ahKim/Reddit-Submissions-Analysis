It's a hallucinatory dream sequence of nine goddesses saving this poor soul from betamaleitis (or foreveralonitis.).  The cinematography is incredible. SMEnt really pushed the creative boundaries to a new level without a being a multi-genre bending song (like IGAB, which I thought was great). 


The only thing people should question about the MV is the fact that it's supposed to be a heart transplant, but the girls keep grabbing in the lower abdomen area to unbutton him....multiple times. kekekekekeke

ALL ABOUT THE MV HYPE TRAIN WITHOUT HATE -&gt; POST HERE

(Also, I'm wondering if they'll be doing the Mr.Mr. stylized cardiograph accessories as merchandise. I do fashion/costume design, but dabble in accessories, so was considering replicating the MV pieces to sell if they didn't. Any interest?)",21,18

I was wondering how many views we have right now for the Mr.Mr. mv, Youtube says its around the 3 million, but other sites like kpopstarz say it is already past 19 million.. (I don't know if this is a reliable site.) :

http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/81678/20140228/girls-generation-releases-mr-mr-mv-today-huge-attention.htm

And there are a lot of pictures going around with screenshots of the 21 million views...

likehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bhpu4kHCUAIhgmR.png:large

This may be all fake, but I wonder, does anyone here know how many views the mv really has right now, or are we all in the dark?

Thanks in advance!

You can tell these girls really care for each other and support each other. I like the idea that they live in a dorm every time they promote or get ready to release new music. I like how they trained together for years before debuting. This helped them form a strong bond.

I also like their image. American pop music is overly sexualized and usually have raunchy dancing and costuming. Whereas with this group its more sensual, fun, catchy dancing and they can have a dark/mature/cute/friendly image. They aren't over the top.

This is why I prefer girl groups from the Kpop genre than American ones. I've always noticed that girl groups in America don't last that long and then there's always one person who breaks out and does a solo project which ultimately will mean the group disbands shortly afterwards.

I feel like SNSD/Girls' Generation will be around for a long time and I hope they'll soon have tons of performances in the US.",13,0

The Future of Girls' Generation?",Spiky_porc,1394435561,"So, I was commenting on another post about girls' generation disbanding and it had me wondering what other people think about it.

SNSD have been together for 7 years now, which is a long time for any kpop group. And although I don't think they will be disbanding in the near future, it's gonna happen sometime right? They can't still be doing this in their 30s can they?

Well, I personally think that they don't necessarily have to disband, even if they reach 30. I mean, 30s the new 20 isn't it? Shinwha are still together, and yes, it is easier in the entertainment business for older men but I believe SNSD can do it. Lee Hyori is also still performing, although just not in a group.

Even if their popularity dwindles, there's no reason they can't keep releasing albums or mini-albums every 1, 2 or even 3 years, alongside any solo activities of course. Even if they can't dance anymore, they can still release ballads and some nice vocal songs. Even when they all have families, they can still sing. They probably won't promote as much, or even at all during that time but I'll still be happy if I can listen to their voices on albums.
Out of all the kpop groups, SNSD members really do seem close and I believe they will stick together. The only problem I see is how SM will treat them once their popularity drops. But they can always switch labels when contracts end and all that other legal stuff. I'm hopeful they will work something out, again, just like how Shinwha has.

Anyway, I'm sure SNSD will always have fans to support them, like me for instance, even if they do become Grandmas' Generation.

Anyway, thats my rant over, YEONGWONHI SO NYUH SHI DAE!

TLDR:

I personally think SNSD can still be SNSD well into their 30's. Now for your opinion.
Will you keep supporting SNSD? Do you want to see them continue for years to come? Or do you think they should just stop before they get too old?",9,8

419,2014-3-13,2014,3,13,2,208tjw,FULL fan translation of SooHyoYoon's appearance on Park Kyung Lim's radio show yesterday! (12 March 2014),arthurmauk,1394645569,"[TRANS] Sooyoung said there are plans for a full album later in the year.

[TRANS] Hyoyeon said there are both individual and group plans. Well be able to see SNSD without any breaks

[TRANS] They said that everyone in SNSD was pissed that they had to reshoot the MV. They had to shoot it really early, all day.

[TRANS] Sooyoung said she shot the most scenes but that she was sad that she basically didnt make it in MV.

Hyoyeon said they often talk about how long they want to be SNSD. Their goal is to become like Shinhwa.

-Sooyoung said that she thinks SNSD is the funniest girl group.

-They said Sooyoung, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Yoona are the funniest members.

-Hyoyeon says she never wants to stop being a celebrity. She wants to continue through dance or through performances.

-Yoona wants to keep doing acting, but she said she needs to get better. She doesnt really know what she wants to do?

-Sooyoung said the only sure thing about the future is that the SNSD members will be next to her.

-Sooyoung says she sees Sunny in variety, Tiffany as a producer, herself in styling, Hyoyeon as a choreographer.

-Hyoyeon says right now her biggest worry is the future. Its become a huge worry since last year. She needs to start planning.

-Yoonas biggest worry is her health. After her drama ended, she lost so much more weight. So shes sensitive about her health now.

-When Hyoyeon was talking about her uncertainty in her future, Sooyoung wrote on the paper Hyoyeon hwaiting!

-Sooyoungs biggest worry is whether SNSD should do music they like, or music the public likes.

-Sooyoung wants to show a more mature side to themselves. Not just music, but in interviews as well.

-Sooyoung wonders if in interviews she should say what she wants to say, or what the public wants to hear.

-Hyoyeyon says Sooyoung and Yoona cry a lot.

-Yoona doesnt listen to high-tempo songs. She likes mid-tempo/ballads.

-She likes listening to Damien Rices Aime when its raining and shes sad

-Hyoyeon said everyone except herself likes ballads and mid-tempos.

-Sooyoung said she once listened to Hyos MP3s and she couldnt listen to it. She thoughts she was in a club.

-Sooyoung starts off her concerts by watching Beyonce videos and pretends shes Beyonce.

-Sooyoung watches Beyonce vids and thinks to herself, Im a diva! and changes her expressions and shakes her hair.

-Sooyoung says that she can hit Beyonces high notes one by one but she cant do a riff with multiple notes in a row. LMFAO

-Hyoyeons fashion role model is Lee Hyori.

-Hyoyeons wish for a solo song would be a song and concept like Lee Hyoris Hey Girl.

-Sooyoung doesnt think it was better than her dating was revealed. When asked if she wanted it to be secret 4ever, she didnt answer

-Sooyoung doesnt think she can even consider a solo.

-Hyoyeon doesnt think shes the nicest member in SNSD. She thinks the nicest member is Seohyun.

-Hyoyeon said she didnt think SNSD would do well from the start.

-Hyoyeon said that during debut, she never saw the big picture. She only saw herself and knew she needed to do well for herself.

-Hyoyeon said she only started thinking about the team as a whole starting from Kissing You era.

-Yoona said that she likes it when the man kind of secludes her away from everyone else.

-When asked if she thought she was the prettiest member in SNSD, Yoona didnt answer and just laughed.

-Sooyoung said everyones sexy charms are different.

-Sooyoung said, And some more tanned members look sexier and Hyo said Shes talking about herself again""

-Yoona said that Goodbye is a song that SNSD and the fans like.

From what I understand a lot of people were upset that the two were collaborating with a Western artist.  

So would you guys have a problem if the girls did collabs with Western artists? For me personally I wouldn't have a problem with it, hell I'd even welcome it, as long as the artist fit with the girls and it wasn't a collab just for the sake of doing one. In the case of GD and CL I thought it was a great collab that fit them both. I wasn't really sure why everyone was upset about it.  

What do you guys think?",31,10

And on the off chance that I do look up a translation, I end up being rather disappointed by either the cheesiness or blandness of the words. Beep Beep, for instance, sounded like a nice happy little tune and ended up being the utterances of a rather whiny, attached, paranoid girlfriend

Same with Mr. Mr, it turned out to be another ""oppa you're the best"" song when it sounded like more of a song of the girls criticizing a guy (especially with the video).

Anyone else feel this way or am I just fucked up",17,12

&gt;TO MY LOVING DAUGHTER SOOYOUNG AND MY 9 PRETTY DAUGHTERS,

&gt;THE GIRLS WHO WOULD ASK ME TO BUY THEM BUBBLE TEA DURING THEIR TRAINEE DAYS HAVE NOW GROWN INTO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. ALTHOUGH YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME AWAY FROM HOME, OUR DAUGHTER WOULD NEVER SHOW THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF HARDSHIP. THANK YOU FOR GOING BACK TO FILL THE GAP OF THE TIME WE LOST TOGETHER THEN BY SPENDING IT WITH YOUR FAMILY NOW. YOU WERE JUST FINISHED WITH YOUR DRAMA FILMING AND THE TIME WAS ALREADY PAST 3AM SO I THOUGHT I WOULD WELCOME YOU HOME BY WAITING FOR YOU. WITH A TIRED FACE, YOU EMBRACED ME ENTIRELY. WHEN MORNING CAME, YOU WOULD PACK YOUR BELONGINGS TO GO OVERSEAS AND SEEING THAT BROKE ME BUT I HAD TO HOLD BACK MY TEARS. ALTHOUGH MY LIFE WAS LONG, MY TIME SPENT AS YOUR FATHER WAS SHORT. SOOYOUNG, BE THANKFUL FOR ALL YOUR FANS WHO LOVE YOU AND DONT BE HURT BY THE OBSTACLES THAT MAY COME YOUR WAY. I WANT TO SHARE GOOD NEWS WITH YOU TODAY. THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR MEMBERS AND THE DONATIONS OF FANS OVERSEAS, WE WERE ABLE TO FORM A TEAM TO HELP TREAT BLIND PATIENTS IN KOREA. TO MY DAUGHTERS, BE THE LIGHT AND HOPE TO SHINE ONTO DARKNESS AND ONES TO POUR ENDLESSLY TO THOSE WHO ARENT FORTUNATE AS HEALING GENERATION. LETS KEEP GOING FOREVER.

&gt;IN REPRESENTATION OF ALL THE SNSD FATHERS, SOOYOUNGS DAD,

**Taeyeon:** I made my debut at the age of 19 and with back to back promotions, I spent my days not knowing how the day went by and what do you know, a year, two years would pass by just like that. At times, I forget how old I am. I felt as if I stopped at 21.

**Lee Kyungkyu:** Your age?


**Taeyeon:** Yes. So when people ask me how old I will be this year, it's to the point where I have to think about it because I can't remember.


**Tiffany:** (Whispers) 26.


T**aeyeon:** Yes, I'm 26.


**Sung Yuri:** You still seem like such a baby.


**Taeyeon:** And then we had a year-long hiatus. During that hiatus, I had a lot of time to think to myself that the emptiness gave me. My personality type is the one to keep picking at my scars and I make myself tired from all the stress I cause.


**Lee Kyungkyu:** We heard you drink a lot also.


**Taeyeon:** Y-yes...I don't go out to drink but to help myself sleep better since I can't sleep from all the thoughts running through my mind. I don't drink heavily either, since I'm good with just a glass of beer. When I talk about these hardships with other colleagues, they'll eventually say, ""Well, you're SNSD."" Even when I speak to my seniors, they tell us that this is the best part of our careers which leaves me feeling as if I can't really tell someone how I feel comfortably.


**Lee Kyungkyu:** (To Hyoyeon) Why are you crying?


**Hyoyeon**: It's because I never knew that a member was having thoughts like that. She (Taeyeon) seems as if she'd tell bit by bit to other members but I wish for her to either open up a little more or tell us more, and increase her time enjoying it with the other members which I think can be a solution to her keeping everything to herself.


**Taeyeon:** That's really the problem with me, that if no one asks me, then I don't tell. But the thing I'm so fortunate for is to be promoting in a group. I don't really have friends or close colleagues (so SNSD is all I have).

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't see this posted and thought it deserved some attention. The Korean magazine IZE did a special article series on Girls' Generation. It goes through a bit of their history and individual spotlights on each member. It is a fun read and I highly recommend it for new sone as you'll learn a bit more about all the members. These were all painstakingly translated by [@ch0sshi](https://twitter.com/ch0sshi), so make sure to show her some love.

Their first world tour was named 'Girls' Generation World Tour Girls &amp; Peace'. That world tour wasn't a world tour as they only traveled to various Asian countries.

Do you think this next world tour will have them come to the US and other countries on the Western Hemisphere?",47,3

I am working hard to try to get some more new stuff out.

I did manage to put up a new shirt, based on the disc heart logo from the Mr. Mr. album. This time I switched the color scheme around since the last shirt had the bright pink ink.

[SNSD Mr. Mr. Heart Logo Shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/183063049/girls-generation-snsd-mr-mr-gg-heart?)

The other colors of shirts and size chart can be seen in the pictures on the listing.

As always, coupon code **SNSDREDDIT** will give you 15% off your total order when entered at checkout.

I also posted a new [2NE1 shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/183052336/2ne1-crush-logo-k-pop-t-shirt?ref=listing-shop-header-0) in case any of you Sones are also Blackjacks.

Thank you all for your continued support, and if you have questions please ask! I'll hopefully have more new designs for SNSD and other groups up very soon.",11,21

Here's a solution: we create a separate subreddit for SONE. We can have our discussions there and it can become a subreddit more for us socialising and making friends, whilst /r/SNSD can keep to posts specifically about the girls.
